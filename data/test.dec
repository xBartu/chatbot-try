Let me see what I can do.
Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.
Tons
You always been this selfish?
What crap?
What good stuff?
I hope so.
They do not!
Who?
Is he oily or dry?
Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
You know the deal.  I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go --
What's normal?
Can we go now?
You're welcome.
Like you care.
I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go, because you won ' t.
What?
Why?
As in...
After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --
It's just you.
I have a date, Daddy.  And he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know.
Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?
Never
North, actually.  How'd you   ?
How many people go here?
Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't even think about it
Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.
Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you.  So what's the point?
You wanna go out with him?
That's what I just said
Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -
Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile.
I've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you'll find helpful.
Don't make me do it, man
Sure
I don ' t know.  I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it.
You get the girl.
Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.
And why would I do that?
I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image.
What?
Does this conversation have a purpose?
You could always go with me.  I'm sure William has some friends.
Who cares?
I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.
Funny, you're the only one
I'm fine. I'm
I just need to lie down for awhile
But it's Gigglepuss - I know you like them.  I saw you there.
Busy
Unwelcome.
Fallacy.
Why not?
Nothing!  There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.
It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
Oh huh
Is that right?
So what I want doesn't matter?
What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?
When I go?
Yeah.  I guess.
Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm just in this for the cash.
Just for now.
Sweet love, renew thy force!
It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.
See you next week!
Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country.
Tumescent!
But -- who -- what --?
Your daughters went to the prom.
Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
Your life, and that of others!
Did He not choose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world?
On the contrary, Your Eminence.  It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross.
I know.
I'd love to argue with you sometimes.  But you're never here!
Not everything... Do you think I care?  I'm a free man again.  Riches don't make a man rich, they only make him busier...
Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.
Yes... I remember...
I am afraid this is not the worst news.
There must be a passage to that other ocean.
He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.
Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
Forgive me, Don Colon.  But what about gold?
Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
To open a new route to Asia.  At the moment there are only two ways of reaching it...
Colon!  Don't!
I lied.  The journey will be longer than I said.
You are bound by an oath, Father.
You'll always be older than me, Father.
Oh?  So you are a new man?
They come and go as naked as the day God created them...
My horse doesn't work.
Immediately.
You think I don't know that?
You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
Is this true, Brother Buyl?
Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit down.  What do you need?  What are you looking for?
Yes.  Yes, come with me!
You bring the cigarettes?
What's your cut?  How much?
Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.
No.
So you were never a prostitute?
I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
Pouring it out!
Vodka tonic.
When?
Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.
Watch the news?
Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
Stay here.
Something back home?
You wanna talk to her alone?
You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
Just a shower?
Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not.  Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional.
How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer.  Here, here's a number of an Immigration lawyer.  That's how you help her. But you can't get involved in her like that.  You're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case.  And lemme give you another piece of advice.  Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television.  And when you get out there, they know your face.  And the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job.  And I get more done because of it.
What's your accomplishment.
Then do it, asshole.
If you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck.
I really can't give out any information right now at this point.
He was hurt, but not seriously.  He'll be fine.
Yeah.  Now's not a good time.
Hey.
Oh, I'm sorry.  Did I embarrass you, sweetheart?  Oh...
Answer the phone.
Well, that's great.
I promise.  We'll talk.  You'll be great.  You'll be fine.  Go ahead, just imagine that, uh... Just look into the lens and imagine you're talking to me.
You're worried for my safety.  I'm touched.
Keep them out of my way.
Yeah, yeah.  Jesus.
Again?  I didn't wanna do it the first time.
Alright, alright - don't hurt me! Please, it's in my book, in my purse!
Is there a problem?
Million?!  The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview?
I want to document my trip to America.
Because I don't like your ugly language. I heard enough of it in school!  Now speak Czech or English.  And don't fool around anymore.  You almost got us thrown out!
Why should I carry your bag?  I am not a dog.
I'm homesick.  You have Eastern European girl?  A Czech girl?
Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?
And the whore's murder?  You didn't erase that either, did you?  Don't lie, I won't be angry.
Oleg, don't be paranoid.  You got a hundred-fifty thousand dollars, didn't you?  I gave you half of what they gave me.  Look - here we are!
Credit?
Ha. Ha.
As a plumber?!
A job??  As a plumber???  You think I come to America to work!
I can't talk to anybody right now, can't you see I'm busy!  I can't talk business.  Hang up.  Have a drink.  Get her a whiskey.
This footage will work in your favor. When the jury sees this - no matter what Cutler tries, they'll convict him.
Then answer my questions.  Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here?
What are you coming here to do?
Thanks.  Appreciate it.
He's my collar!
He's yours but I take him in!  I'll drive him to the precinct, you can have him but I'm walkin' him in.
A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you for this!  You violated my civil rights!
Yeah, I'm religious.  I'm not an Atheist like you!  Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not?
I used an accelerant.
I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?
Clean?
He knew all along.
That's why he was so quiet.  He was testing us.
Yeah?
It hurts.  Aw, Jesus!
You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.
She's wonderful.
I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out.
Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.
Oh, well, apparently there's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don't know, and that's why we were trained separately and that's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard.
I guess it isn't.
Are you reasonably awake?
Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
Yes.
Well, now that we've got one that's actually failed, we should be able to figure out what's happened and fix it.
I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy.
I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.
What is it, Hal?
Yes, I know.
Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.
Hal, is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem?
I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.
How many days until you come home?
Goodbye, Daddy.
How is gregor?
Well, where are all of you off to?
Well, that does sound very odd.
Yes, very pleasant.
Fine.
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
I see.
Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.
Any clue as to what it is?
I take it this is something to do with the trouble they're having up at Clavius?
That's true.
It looks like we have another bad A.O. unit. My FPC shows another impending failure.
Let me see the tracking alignment display.
Hammond.
Yeah, I've been busy.
How about chargin' the battery?
Fuck off.  I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.
Look, give me a break, you're going to have to settle for her place.  It's the only thing I know.
You got a real big mouth, convict.
Just do what I say, okay? We'll pay for the girls and have a good time... Don't you trust me?
Here you go sweetheart, throw it my way.
Yeah, i been waiting three years.
No, it's gotta be here and now. Believe me. Only I don't have the damn money for a room...
Don't give me that police shit. You drop it.
Would you guys...
Get this.  We ain't partners. We ain't brothers.  We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead.  And if Ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.
Just throw me the Goddamn gun.
Thank you.
Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.
Yeah, I want mandolins, flowers... They move off down the corridor.
She's got the same complaint as half the Goddamn population.  She can't get the job she's trained for and it pisses her off... Anyway, what the fuck do you care?
You need five years training to handle a joint like...
What are you talkin' about?
I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes.
My kind of place. I always liked country boys.
Wait a minute.  Maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us.  How about it? I been nearly three years in prison and...
You wanna leave, man?  Let me take care of Ganz all by myself.
You're a real case, you know that, Jack?
I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em.  Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money.  They got nothing to do with helping you make it.
I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
Yeah, it doesn't look like he's gonna make it as a dangerous tough guy...
Class isn't somethin' you buy, punk. Look at you, five hundred dollar suit and you're still a lowlife.
You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.
Bein' good at your job don't explain everything, Jack ...
I can just take her right across the street to Luther's hotel.  All I need is some money for the room.
Luther's on the move...
I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.
Every last bit of it.  The big guy's room was empty.
Hey ... Dick Tracy.
I'm heading out. How about you?
I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.
What makes you think I have any clean shirts at my place?
That's the way I see it, too.
I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...
This is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave.
No, it's I'm just surprised you called.
Jack, wait...
I've been better...Dead end.  No Ganz, no Indian.
Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this.
Yeah, bein' a hard-ass all the time is a real drag, but it works.
Name's Hammond, Reggie Hammond. I heard a lot about you. And any friend of Jack's is a friend of mine.
Shut up.
Sure, right.
Don't give me this, we were partners.
Five bills.
No, I'm not proud of myself... But we don't have the luxury of choice.
No thank you.
You noticed...
I know. I was there when she arrived.
Good luck..
When is she not in trouble?
Thank you, Mr. President.
Yes. Of course..
Good work, my son.  Now all we need is a way to get there.
On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
Who?
Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.
Hey bud! Finger here.
Don't exist bud.
You forgetting who sat next to you for a thousand missions. I know how you drive.
In your dreams! See you tonight!
So, just how big was this fare?
You're not that bad... Come on we'll get you to a doctor.
I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it?
I had the worst goddamn nightmare.
Thanks for reminding me..
Uh... not really.
I'll take you to the bar, after that, you're on your own.
I don't think this is a good time...
Not without Leeloo.
Because...
Uh..
You're welcome..
Actually only one cell survived..
It's not that easy..we've never encountered anything like it before..you see normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself..This one has 200,000.
This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside. Almost like it was...engineered.
Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?
An elephant couldn't crack it.
Don't worry, Sir. I have the perfect one.
How much time is left?
I can hear you, Mr. President, but I can't see you .
Really? Maybe I can get you on my screen and see you at last!
You know, Amy, I've been sitting around in bars and everywhere following this guy... I mean, is this what I get first thing?  Before you even "hello," you accuse me... ?
We've been all through that.  I've been on my best behavior.
I'm not using him again for anything.  He was worthless.  You have bridge here Saturday?
... What's going on?
It has to be this way for now.  It won't be long.
Amy...
She's all I've got.  She's the only witness.
I just talked to her.
There ain't no such thing as snuff. Why don't you fuck off?
I just got a call... two seconds ago, some motherfucker called... says he knows about the loop.
We can do that.
Right here.
Where are the women?
Move it, dirtbag... !
Call me Tom.
We do.
Why don't they come to me?
Any good?
I know what you did.
I don't know...
I told you, I don't know.
What the fuck do you want from me?
Show me where you buried her.
That's right, you just stood there and watched, because you "felt like it."  Almost makes you worse.
I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.  Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?
I'm listening.
They're no friends of mine.
Go ahead, shoot me.  Then try driving to Brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield.
Catchy title.  What are you really reading?  Hard to believe that book's got any parts worth highlighting.
Might get drummed out of the pornographer's union, and then where would I be?
Came back for that battery-operated vagina, right?  Told you you would.
Thomas Welles.  Nice picture.
From Pennsylvania.  P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here?
Wake up, pops.  Your education begins tonight.
Child pornography.
What other ways are there to get illegal films?  Who do you see?
You want me to come out there and play private eye?
I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players...
"Devil" frightened me as much as it excited me, but I'd be hard pressed to choose a favorite.
I'm trying to figure that out myself.  I have to see Machine without his mask.
It's money.  People use it to purchase goods and services.
He's a lawyer.  Please, sit, here...
I'm telling you it's not that.
No.  For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police.  I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first...
Any evidence you collect can be given to the police later, anonymously.  I've thought about it and there's no other way.  If you can't find them... if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for, well I can't let that happen.  I'm telling you I won't.  If there's no chance that poor girl's memory can be served, then I'll just have to spend my last days trying to forget her.
You've found missing persons before.
The checks were for odd amounts...
Okay, I follow you so far...
You're one hell of a detective, Mrs. Christian.
I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright?
You probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat.  Drinking whiskey, chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses. Want to know what it's really like? It's sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight, pissing in a plastic bottle, pardon me, because some guy thinks his wife's cheating on him. Glamorous, huh?  And the guy who hired you, he has a hair-lip, dandruff and crooked teeth, and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife's cheating, and you don't blame her.
Yes.
We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
It got to be too much for him.
No one knows what it's like.  You can't even imagine how much it hurts.
Of course.
There wasn't one.  The police looked.
I don't know.  I think so.
Mrs. Mathews?  It's Thomas.  Do you remember, I was there a few weeks ago... asking about your daughter...
No...
You... you do?  You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure...
He's an imbecile.  I tried to warn my daughter, but what can you do?
Excellent.  we accept MasterCard and American Express.
It is...was. It's a zapper, it might help me stay awake.
Yeah, I'm not so sure.
Great, you wouldn't happen to know his phone number?
Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much.  You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.
That obvious, huh?
Saw who? I was up all night cramming for this physics test, and I was putting this little baby together.  Look...
The story is, the deaths you can't argue with.
You know, I get the weirdest feeling we've been through this before.
It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.
She knew she was gonna die.
How she doing?  I ran into her last night.
Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.
Mother, you've just murdered me.  Take that to your goddamn therapy...
It's no just a house. It's his home. He's waiting there for me...to dream.
My friend, with the funny hand.
Come on downstairs.  He won't hurt you. He needs us both.
He's inside you, where he hides.
It's where he hides out.  Inside.  That's how he found me.
Me too.
No.  A deal's a deal.
To take a picture.
You sure you don't want a ride to work?
Since my little girl became a mom...
But Dad --
Had kind of a long night.
I just can't figure out how he's getting in when I'm awake...
What do you think I'm doing?  Look.  Whether you believe it or not, Krueger is back.  He's after the baby and if I don't try to do something about it, who will??
Jacob.  We've got to get to Amanda before it's too late.
I think I'm starting to wear her down.  Have some anyway.
Yeah.  I'm just aces.
Nobody thinks that.
I don't know!
Then we'll find another way.
No shit.
Naah, I'm done.  Got to be on shift in a couple hours.  Aren't you going in?
It was supposed to be.  Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.
You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?
- any more than being the son of Captain Neilsen does!
Yes?
But if they <u>do</u>?
A lot of people think like that.
Skipper!  Look at the depth gauge!
Oh it does???
Sidearms?  But the saucer's dead.
Yes, Griff?
Something wrong?
Anything ---
Who with?
Huh?
After torpedo room:  Report!
Point of view is everything. To us, <u>your</u> form of life is ugly as we appear to you.
On the contrary.  I want you - unharmed - perfect.
Obviously.
Or, perhaps, until he gets us?
Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question.
Has anybody offered to buy it?
Just tell me when you'll have it fixed.
Yeah. I know about that.
Shit! What are we gonna do?
That was me.
Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.
Yeah.
You think so.
You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine.
And you'll get your extra hundred bucks.
Some job. Here, have a hit. Don't be such a hardass. I know you got problems, but everybody's got problems.
Right!
Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or something. I just heard the gun go off.
What the fuck you telling me, Wade? I never seen the guy get shot, I told you that.
Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?
Look. Those kids are still trick-or- treating. They're still out.
I don't care. They're out.
What are you talking about?
It's not that.
I want to go home.  I don't like it here.
I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me.
That's fine with me too. When Mommy comes, tell her I'm up here.
Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
No.
Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --
Watch this snow. It's coming down tonight.
At the school crossing. In his BMW. Coulda hurt some kids. I'm gonna bust his ass.
What am I -- a security guard? You hired me, you and your Selectman friends.
I'm not saying that.
You ain't the hunter Jack is. And he can't drive the grader worth shit.
Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade's car, fix the clutch.
Maybe.
Could be.
Where is she now? Is she in the truck with your friends?
For a while.
Yeah.
Said what?
I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.
You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.
You knew me as a kid.
There's another thing I've been thinking about. I don't know how you feel about the idea, Margie, because we've never talked about it. But I've been thinking lately, I've been thinking we should get married sometime. You and me.
How?
Jesus Christ, Pop, let's go home. I got waylaid. Sorry.
Can --?
Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr. Gordon.
Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just --
Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just had a little business to settle with Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police officer.
He got his deer yet?
A lesson in work and its rewards. You'll thank me for this one day.  Sally, turn off that TV!
We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?
Wade. I thought she was alright. Till this morning she was.
You think you can take me now? Come on, try.
Love! I'm made of love!
I don't know you. My goddamn father and I don't know you.
There was something. It happened up your way.
He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.
What happened?
I get to feeling like a whipped dog some days, Rolfe, and some night I'm going to bite back. I swear it.
A hunting accident is perfect.
It's okay, honey. I got you. I got you. You're okay.
Okay, I'm slowing us down.
He's busy being dead.
We still got three MiGs running around and six more on the way.
Sluggish... I think it's jammed too.
We don't know that.
That kid's name was Jim Marshall.
We've got four hours before they make it into Turkienistan airspace.
My loyalty was never to my country.
Dead.
We're not going to make it.
Very good. Thank you, Ms. Mitchell.
Please. You can kill me but leave my daughter alone.
You're very valuable. And our nation needs so many things.
Over my dead body.
Pity. Mr. Gibbs.
You don't like seeing people get hurt. Now in morality, that is a virtue. In politics, however, that is weakness.  You were a hostage to everyone else *                    long before you were a hostage to
Gravity.
Rose, I don't have time for this.
White House Situation room.
Freeing Stravanavitch is gonna get tens of thousands killed. I can't live with that.  I'm not royalty. I'm an elected official and the integrity of the office of the President is infinitely more important than the man who holds that office.  We don't negotitate. Not as long as I'm President. Is that understood?
We're under attack.
Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.
This is a crime bill, Shep.  Killing a couple ducks won't get it through committee.  Besides, Shep, I told you...  I don't shoot babies and I don't kiss guns.
How long's it been since you flew, sir?
Te...!
Ask Simon.
You're as bad as the rest of them, Elaine!  It's all here in the design specifications!  Look!  It's all here!
Who's that, Ted?
Let me by, Elaine.
What word would you use, Elaine?
What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.
Ted, please be careful.
The sun will heat that thing to over 450 degrees within seconds.  He'll roast like a pig on a spit.
I mean for Ted.
Yes, sir.
That's okay, ROK.
Scraps.
I don't want to live anymore.
What should I say?
I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown.
Pull yourself together!  We've got to...
Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.
Thank you. Cream?
Were you vacationing in Los Angeles?
No. I'm all alone.
Can you fly this airplane and land it?
I <u>am</u> serious, and don't call me Shirley! What flying experience have you had?
I can't tell.
A hospital? What is it?
Certainly.
Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.
He had fish.
Your <u>war</u> <u>record</u>? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history.
I remember everything. All I have are memories.
Seven. Lieutenant Zipp died this morning. Ted, Doctor Sandler says you'll be out in a week. Isn't that wonderful?
That's Lieutennt Hurwitz. Severe shell shock. He thinks he's Ethel Merman.
Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war.
Oh yes, I saw. Poor child.
The cockpit? What is it?
Thank you, Randy. You better leave sweetheart. You might get hurt in here.
Not unless I got real drunk and nobody told me about it later.
Your voice is saying no, but your body is saying yes.
Yeah...
Lay off, asshole.
And that fits?
And still it fits?
Why the hell--?!  Great, fine.  You talk to the wife.
Did you talk to him?
At the end of the bar.
From quarantine, when my people first arrived here.  He and I were housed together.
Three months.  We learn quickly.  We adapt.  It is our strength... what we were bred for, to adapt to hostile environments.
Ss'trokya ss'lato 'na'.
My wife?  She worries about me.
Yeah, go home.  Get some sleep.  You do sleep, don't you?
George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?
To the... to the beach?
Your people don't know about this part of out past.  And they can't know -- It would threaten our entire existence here.
Harcourt was the brain who brought it all together.
The fifty kilos, Matthew.  I have to find it.  I can't let it get out on the street.
We can't let him get away.
What is it?
Who else can I ask around here?
Come on.  You got nothin' better to do, cushy county job like yours.
You mean the Blob?  They're finishing up now.
Put on your wash-and-wear suit and your clip-on tie, have your landlady tie your shoes for you, and show up at the church.  Simple.  Me and Carol are going.
Hey, look -- we've known Kristin since... since she was conceived in that cabin up in Big Bear. Remember?  You and Edie banged the wall so hard, me and Carol were picking plaster out of our hair for a week...
Christ.  I never saw such a buncha old women.  You want me to fetch your slippers, Hudson?
Let's go...let's go.  Cycle through!
Ten seconds, people.  Look sharp!
Vasquez, take point.  Let's move.
Well, thanks, I --
They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case.
Hear me out...
What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?
If you go.  It's a second chance, kiddo.  And it'll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it.  You gotta get back on the horse...
I suggest you study the disks Ripley has been kind enough to prepare for you.
It's insured.
Shit.  Apone, collect magazines from everybody.  We can't have any firing in there.
Thirty-eight...simulated.
Gorman!  Give it a rest would you.
I don't know.
Sir?
Are you finished?  You okay?
Aye-firmative.
Maybe.  Maybe not.
We ain't going anywhere.
Hey...hey!  Look, Crowe and Dietrich aren't dead, man.
Oh, God.  Jesus.  This ain't happening.
Yeah, right, it runs from the processing station right into the sublevel here.
Yeah.  What?
No.. I've slept enough.
Why not?
You promise?
Did one of those things grow inside her?
Did you ever have a baby?
You mean dead.
I'll be right in the other room, Newt.  And look...I can see you on that camera right up there.
Look!
Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That will be...
Certainly!
A Turkish brothel.
Well, what does it matter to you?
Don't bother!
Don't bother.
But he needs to be here in Salzburg, Your Grace. He needs me and he needs you. Your protection, your understanding.
Oh sir, yes! He's about to make the worst mistake of his life. Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage. I know my son. He is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him.
Yes, sir, that's the truth. But don't blame him. The fault is mine. I was too indulgent with him. But not again. Never again, I promise! I implore you - let me bring him back here. I'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully.
Oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in anything. Please, Your Grace, give him one more chance.
Who the devil are you? What do you want?
Yes, I think it's brilliant. You've been doing it for years.
Em iram! Em iram!
Just say it - you'll see. It's very serious. Em iram!  Em iram!
No!
I love you! I love you!
These gentlemen are from Salzburg.
I'm talking about now. How much will you give him now? Down payment?
Why not? Half the house!
No one.
You'd think I was mad.
I can't write it!
Sir, we really need this job. We're desperate. My husband spends far more than he can ever earn. I don't mean he's lazy - he's not at all - he works all day long. It's just! he's not practical. Money simply slips through his fingers, it's really ridiculous, Your Excellency. I know you help musicians. You're famous for it. Give him just this one post. We'd be forever indebted!
That's very tempting, but it's impossible, I'm afraid. Wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing. You see, they're all originals.
Tonight?
He's doing his best.
So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time.
I'd like a little wine, if you have it.
Majesty.
Yes?
Ah-ha. Favouritism. But I so want Mozart.
You please me, Court Composer. A very clever idea.
Well. There it is.
Majesty, I did. Believe me, it was a most agonizing. decision. But finally, I simply could not recommend Herr Mozart.
Yes?
The Director of our Opera. Count Orsini-Rosenberg.
Did we vote in the end for German or Italian?
Because I've already found the most wonderful libretto!
It's actually quite amusing, Majesty. It's set - the  whole thing is set in a - in a -
Yes, indeed.
Oh, yes. Absolutely. German. Unquestionably!
Well, I mean occasionally it seems to have, how shall one say?  How shall one say, Director?
Well - Well we haven't quite received my father's consent, Your Majesty. Not entirely. Not altogether.
Thank you, Sire!
Ah! By all means.
Well, yes, I admit it is.
Well, Majesty, it is only a comedy.
I have no idea.
Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight!
Well. There it is.
Don't you have a maid?
I want you to come back with me to Salzburg, my son.
Papa!
Do any pupils come to the house?
I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!
You don't know what it's like. Herr Mozart frightens me. He drinks all day, then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.
Here, in his stomach. They bend him right over.
Yes. I can live in or out just as you wish.
Yes, well, it's all good fun.
I'd like to try them someday. I'm not sure I'd be much good at it.
Madame.
Of course, it's him. Who do you think it is?
Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.
Ah, love! Well of course in Italy we know nothing about that.
Your Excellency, you requested some specimens of my work. Here they are. I don't have to tell you how much I need your help. I truly appreciate your looking at these. I have pressures on me - financial pressures. As you know, I'm a married man now.
She is well. She is - well, actually, I'm about to become a father! She only told me last night. You are the first to know.
Sommer? Herr Sommer? But the man's a fool! He's a total mediocrity.
You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?
It has been said, my friend, that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means.
Forgive me. We all have patriotic feelings of some kind.
What exactly are you working on?
I think you overestimate our dear Viennese, my friend. Do you know you didn't even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap?
I never knew that music like that was possible.
I'm taking you home. You're not well.
Then, let us try together. I'd regard it as such an honour. Tell me, what is this work?
Consigned to flames of woe.
What?
Oh, yes.
Yes, yes - go on. The Voca Me. Suddenly sotto voce. Write that down: sotto voce, pianissimo. Voca me cum benedictis. Call me among the blessed.
What for?
On the contrary.
A little modesty would suit you better.
Look, young man, the issue is simple. If you want this post, you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues.
Baron!
I regret it is not too familiar.
Ah - you've heard that?
No, Father. From now on no one will be able to speak of Mozart without thinking of me. Whenever they say Mozart with love, they'll have to say Salieri with loathing. And that's my immortality - at last! Our names will  be tied together for eternity - his in fame and mine in infamy. At least it's better than the total oblivion he'd planned for me, your merciful God!
Incredible.
What? Who the devil are you?
Oh. Well, thank you! How wonderful. Some people get all the luck.
I can't wait.
I agree, Baron.
Who is she?
I'm an orderly, not a bleeding psychiatrist! I push things about, but I've little say what happens to them.
What did he say?
They were lying. There were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic. The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there.
No. He knows no one in London, besides me. I shouldn't have left him alone.
David has suffered a severe trauma. I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor. If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf, why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon?
Is he all right? Why didn't you call me? Where was he?
Yes, I should think so.
I'm not very hungry, thank you.
How is that?
Right.
I thought you were asleep.
I've just started it. My friend gave it to me.
That's not really a very proper question.
Will you come with me?
Not just a patient -- me.
A werewolf?
Lovely.
Okay.
A doper werewolf.
The zoo?
Don't you remember?
I don't know why I feel so good. I haven't felt this good in a long time.
Six people mutilated? It had to be me, Alex.
Will you shut up!?!!
No.
No.
Yes, I should think. He called out just now.
Shakespeare was French! The Queen Mother sucks cocks in hell! Shit! Fuck! Piss!
This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea. He is your good friend, whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities.
What are you going to see?
Do you have bad dreams, too?
Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi?
It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull.
We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that?
A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.
I assume full responsibility.
Nice to see you.
Wrong.
Apparently so.
I don't know. Now that we're out here and it's three degrees, I'm not so sure I wouldn't rather face a blood-thirsty mob.
I have no idea.
It's a full moon, 'beware the moon'.
Yeah.
It's circling us.
Plan?
Walk away, Jack.
I'll tell you when we get there.
Are you going to help me up?
This is too much. I can't handle this.
Hurting your feelings? Has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me? Listen to me, I'm talking to a hamburger!
I can't stand it.
Rudy Levine the shmuck?
David, now I know this may be hard for you, but I have to warn you.
What?!
Jack, please go away. Please go away.
Nurse!
Don't be an asshole, David. Come here.
The canines will be real. You'll taste real blood! God damit, David, please believe me! You'll kill and make others like me! I'm not having a nice time, David! Don't allow this to happen again! You must take your own life!
Hi, David.
Hello.
Well, then, what can I do for Scotland Yard?
Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus are here to see you, Doctor.
I'd like some tea, please.
Yeah.
Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks, I'd quit.
Aw, nerts!
I'm fourteen cents out, and it took me half an hour to find the mistake. And me with a date, too.
Yeah.
What good will that do?  Why, it will take control away from him. We'll put somebody else in charge, call in all doubtful loans, and be on safe ground again. That's what good it will do!
Just pure luck!
What about?
Aw, they've gone crazy. You can't reason with a mob.
I can't? You just wait and see. If that run doesn't stop within the next hour, I'll shut the doors. You know what that means? The bank examiner will step in tomorrow. You'll be forced to liquidate. I'll insist upon it. The depositors will be paid one hundred cents on the dollar. What's left you gentlemen can have. But I'll guarantee there won't be enough to pay your next month's garage bill.
We've been waiting fifteen minutes
That's very simple. I was home.
Oh yes, of course. There was someone with me. A lady.
If you don't mind, Inspector, I'd rather not say - that is, unless it becomes absolutely essential. You see, she's married.
You understand?
All right, Jack, all right.
You don't have to do nothing.
If I thought you were the slightest bit interested, I would.
Yes, yes, it does. What are you doing tonight, Phyllis?
Well
Don't you know?
I'm listening.
Well, that's too bad. Mine's all right too.
But I have to go, dear. It's a very important banker's meeting.
That's what it was you planned, wasn't it?
Yes, thank you.
Ah, Mrs. Pembroke. I spoke to Mr. Schaffer at the Guaranty. He's going to take care of that mortgage for you . . .
No, sir.
Yes, sir.
I suppose you want me to fix that up for you too, eh?
I can't tell you.
So have you. So have I. So's everybody got a record. What difference does that make? You can't go around pinning crimes on people just because they
Don't worry, Mr. Dickson. We'll find out whether he's telling the truth. I'll have a man from headquarters check up on it right away.
What are you talking about?
Did you get the case for the securities?
Board meeting. Oh, that means hours, I suppose.
Yeah.
Okay, honey - but just the same I'd like to take a crack at that
Don't cry, honey. Everything's gonna be all right.
Something's happened. He isn't trying anymore.
Yes. He called some of the biggest people in town.
Yes, I know. Cause the Dooley sisters weren't in yet.
I didn't do it! I haven't got a gun!
Well, about - uh - eleven o'clock.
Then where were you?
I guess so.
They're starting to come in already. Yeah. Yeah. Well, listen. Don't waste any time. Get all the money you can lay your hands on, and bring it down here right away. Step on it.
Jim Younger, I told you--
It's still taking too long. The people used to snap to.
What have you done?
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
Stop by our spread after that, tell our Ma we're all right. We'll go to Doc Mimms.
They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior --
One false move and I'll blow your heads off!
You heard me, Jesse. You know how crazy I get!
You are a fine figure of a man.
Tell me.
You, ya barrel of pork lard. Here piggy piggy!
No, really. You're wife said she needed some help, seeing as you were so fat you couldn't find your --
What will be?
I've robbed just as many banks as you have! I know this town, and I know this bank, and I say it's an easy job.
That's it.
Hmm. Go back to the reservation and get drunk in a dirt shack, or work for you...
Must be a garrison in town. We're in occupied territory, boys.
Which one, right or left?
Sadie was not a man!
Strategically.
Oh, you're in charge? We ain't partners any more, Jesse? You tell Cole Younger where and when to ride?
The bullet came out clean, but he lost a whole lot of blood. Praying wouldn't hurt.
I fooled them into thinking I was alone.
Pff. They hardly even noticed you.
I reckoned.
You're doing just fine.
Think about this. If we just come up with a story and stick to it, we should be all right.
Damn. All that reading paid off.
What do you think?
Shut up.  Uh, Doc, I was wondering if, uh, this evening, I could come by?
Ma.
Make a thousand of 'em. Still won't be enough by the time I'm through.
Bob's upset.
Jesse, we're outlaws.
Yeah.
See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the distraction back there.
A fair number, Ma.
He's a good Christian and he killed Yankees. Jesus told me that made him an all right boy.
Mmmm.
Nuh-huh ...
What you do to me is unfair. The teasing, I mean.
Unfair. You are completely unfair.
You didn't want to farm?
Sparkling rocks?
Me neither.
That's why I picked it. We can start a whole new life down here.
"Hmm" what?
Jesse, have you ever noticed that when you're trying to charm your way out of trouble, your accent gets all farm boy?
What?
Yes ma'am.
I'll explain on the way.
Not that day. I am guilty of many things, but that was Mr. Thaddeus Rains and Parker, that day.
You had all those cattle there, so I'd think the extra men were in town from the cattle drive?
The cows had a brand from a farm just five miles out of town.
Should have just killed Thaddeus Rains and been done with it.
I'm not hanged yet.
Thanks.
I'm the same age you were when you went off to war.
I think so.
This time we'll make an exception.
You're gonna tell her when you're resting up in bed with her, Jimmy.
Really?
They had to be dealt with!
They donate money to farmers, to churches. Rumor has it they gave the sharecroppers of Maddox so much money they were able to build a school.
A further impediment is that the Army garrison has been ordered to move on from Liberty. We will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers.
THEN WHO DID?!
I look forward to seeing it.
Not such a menace now, is he, Pinkerton?
Oh no, I would have done that. But I would have made sure I killed them, too.
I'm afraid our adversaries don't agree.
So you can't tell me anything?
I can't believe this.
Vengeance.
What? Oh, I'm...busy.
Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.
I'm thinking Dorsia.
Sounds like I'll have to. Don't fall asleep, okay? Wear something fabulous. Dorsia, remember?
You know, Courtney, you should take some more lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you out of this slump.
What do you want, Courtney?
Take it off.
You just haven't been looking.
Alright.
My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.
I don't want to talk about it.
Hi. Pat Bateman.
It's not.
Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk about?
Yes, I am.
We never really shared one.
What are the rules for a sweater vest?
Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten? "What about fucking dinner?"
No.
Wait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really comprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes. I'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's fucking head off. I tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your machine was true.
Jesus lives, Luis.
Calm down. Let's do it anyway
Impressive. Very nice. Let's see Paul Owen's card.
Umm...yes...I know it's a little late but is it possible to reserve a table for two at eight or eight-thirty perhaps?
Your friend has already been seated. Follow me, Mr. Halberstam.
Negative. Cancel it.
Just...say...no.
Let's not think about what I want. How about anywhere you want.
Oh, I don't know. No, we'll go anywhere you want.
I'm on a diet. But thank you.
No, not really.
Who's Ted Bundy?
Jean? Hello? Jean?
Jean-I'm not-
What is it, Patrick? Are you alright?
I m into, well, murders and executions mostly.
Hello
No.
Let's not get lewd.  I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.
Does he do this all the time?
Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.
I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen.
No. I'm okay.
No, I'm okay.
No problem.
What do you mean...Yale thing?
No, he just hung out there.
Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?
Oh.
People just...disappear.
Eerie. Really eerie.
Uh, yes...I mean...whenever necessary. You know.
Too true. You know, Bateman-people tend to reveal so much more about themselves when they're in a relaxed setting, don't you think?
Dan, great to see you again. Like I said, you need anything at all, I'm your man. I don't envy your job. I mean Owen was a...complex man.
Wait. That's not what I've got.
Well...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen?
Great, yes, I'd like that.
Not in the mood, I guess.
And?
But Marcus denied it?
Where was Marcus?
It's cold out, too, isn't it?
Al.
I've been great. And you?
It's...it's...all right.
Come on, you dumb son of a bitch.  I've got a preview of the Barneys catalogue and a bottle of Absolut waiting for us.
No, Owen.
Some guys are just born cool, I guess.
If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway.
Prob'ly waiting by the phone for Outpost to call. We'll leave it for him?
It was a hate crime.
I don't know! I just know it was Teddy's code. All these ideas flying in from everywhere. You know how he says "Any kid working in his garage can put us out of business?" It's like they know what every kid's doing.
You're scaring me. I think we should just go.
Milo, you told me those DOJ Agents are all over the place. How could they hope to hide a surveillance post?  And how can you get in there, anyway? With the cameras and the swipe cards --
You can't just walk in, either.
Nothing.
Prick.
Right... What's that mean again?
Give me two seconds with Lacy here?  Go on in, I won't be a moment.
It was racially motivated. He's Chinese. He was. And... I know sometimes the FBI gets involved with that. Don't they?
'Just didn't know who else to talk to.
'Forgot to introduce you.  I have a girlfriend.
And the kid who wrote Skywire -- then gave it away? They're calling him the digital Robin Hood.
Oh hi.
Milo? Gary Boyd. I'm hoping you and your friend can come up here. We've made some amazing strides in digital convergence. I'd love to show them to you.
Low enough to relay internet traffic.
Okay. I'm Gary.
That's insane. You're ahead of your time.
Take a look at this. Slightly different approach.
You're making me young again.
Well -- you sent for me.
What're you implying.
I'm sure.
Oh. Yeah.
It helps. Alice said it would help. To focus on something.  'Don't know what I'd do without her.
'Have a look?
...My dad was a compulsive gambler. Only he didn't think he was. That applied to guys who didn't have a "system." "Losers," who played games of chance. He could "read" people, so chance had nothing to do with it. No matter how deep a hole he dug himself, he'd give you the whole speech. And you'd better not point out the obvious.  His creditors would catch up to him. Loan sharks or whatever. He'd wake us in the middle of the night. Off we'd go, again.
'Sorry about the late notice...
You see what's hanging on the wall?
I do know, Gary. I feel the same way. I thought I was coming here for a job. But it's meant a lot more.
You do?
You are naive. Look at your employment contract: you can't work anywhere else in this field for at least few years.  Not that I don't miss you.
Let's get him in here.
They know. 'Just they don't trust me with it. So we'll get the evidence, first, ask questions later.
I launched Skywire. Just pray the last set of coordinates Milo sent me connected us to Gary's satellite.
I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets.
"There is no second place." Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration.  Is it like that with your counselor?
Why's that?
The Day Care?
But why would they --?
They're already watching you. If they had to, they'd give him this drug that mimics an alcoholic blackout. He'd wake up not even remembering his "act of revenge."
There's always a logical answer -- you just have to define the question.
Certainly not at my happy home.
But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't love to break something like --
What?
And what if the broadcast dishes on top of 21 aren't hot yet? You said the place isn't finished.
What'd he say?
Milo? What if Shrot notices somebody entered the Day Care at four A.M.? And tells them about it?
Perfect.  How am I gonna get away from the party long enough to --
That's lame, isn't it?
She called to apologize. I said I was pulling an all-nighter. She said then come home just to say Hi. Which I always do when we fight, it's suspicious if I don't.
It's three years old, it --
What?
Outpost made me sign 1,000. 'Guess we'll find out what else we have to talk about. Life stuff.
I met this girl.
I don't know.
What d'you mean?
Oh we're not going to the campus.
His Snapples were in alphabetical order.
I've got a girlfriend, remember?
You wanna survive in the software business, you cover your bets... I gotta say, this is the weirdest car anybody ever requested.
Damn. 'Have to go back over there.  Be so much easier if we could walk in the front door.
You may.
Or sometimes not at all.
Sak-i it to me!
Mmmm... I feel extreme relaxation.
Damn. What exactly do you do at Virtucon?
Here, have this can of Campbell's Tomato Soup.
Dr. Evil? I thought I put him in jail for good.
Be careful.
My God, Vanessa's got a smashing body. I bet she shags like a minx. How do I tell them that because of the unfreezing process, I have no inner monologue?  I hope I didn't say that out loud just now.
Right away, Exposition.
Then you'll have to go it alone. Good luck.
Be careful.
Good God, and underground missile. We've long feared such a development.
Yes, Basil?
Well, Destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, I dare to coin.
Oh forget it. As a fellow player on the international stage, Mr.  Powers, I'm sure you'll enjoy watching the curtain fall on the third and final act.
Well done, Mr. Powers. We're not so different, you and I. It's true, you're British, and I'm Belgian. You have a full head of hair, mine is slightly receding. You're thin, I'm about forty pounds overweight. OK, we are different, I'm not making a very good point. However, isn't it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very things you stand for-- swinging, free love, parties, distrust of authority- are all now, in the Nineties, considered to be... evil? Maybe we have more in common than you care to admit.
If it's a lie, goddamn her. It it's the truth, goddamn me.  God, I hope that's witty. How's your mum?
I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative...
I beg your pardon?
Sure.
Yes, we've had it retrofitted with a secure cellular phone, an on-board computer, and a Global Geosynchronous Positioning Device. Oh, and finally, this.
He's too well-protected right now.
No, this is me in a nutshell.
Yes, act naturally and we'll split this scene the way we came in, Vanessa.
Yes.
Behave!
Danger's my middle name.
That's not mine.
I'm telling you, baby, that's not mine.
Sure.
Hey, wait a minute--
Silence!
These are the latest word in android replicant technology.  Lethal, efficient, brutal. And no man can resist their charms. Send in the soldiers!
Thank you, Herr Doctor.
We've heard from Scott, now let's hear from you.
Not me.
But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?
Show me.
Right.  Oh, hell, let's just do what we always do. Let's hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage.  Gentlemen, it's come to my attention that a breakaway Russian Republic called Kreplachistan will be transferring a nuclear warhead to the United Nations in a few days. Here's the plan. We get the warhead, and we hold the world ransom...  ...FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS!
OK. Well, I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago. He was partially frozen for thirty years. I never knew him growing up. He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business.
No, he's really evil.
You don't say. How real does it feel?
There are limits?
No need. I'll call again.
... bottle ...
Black...
... preserve...
Three days.
You don't get rain like you used to in England. A good shower that's the ticket. Stiffens resolve, puckers the spirit, quells the namby-pamby in a man.
Mr. John Steed, please.
After the cold war ...
The Institute ... the funding ...
I had a spot of bother at the door.
So what was all this -- some sort of test?
Whereas you are.
Under the circumstances, you may call me Mrs. Peel.
The most unpredictable piece on the board. And always ready to protect his queen.
As per mother's instructions.
Any other vices?
I mean your man Trubshaw.  Your bullet-proof waistcoat.  I thought you were just overdressed.
Perhaps your memory plays tricks, Mrs. Peel.
Did he say who?
Did you say formal? I must dress.
You mean my other self ...
Very good, Steed ...
Thanks ...  I see what you mean about letting me do the risking ... Hello?
According to Dr. Darling, you're a psychopathic personality with schizophrenic delusions, suffering from recurring amnesia based on traumatic repression, leading to outbursts of anti-social and violent behavior.  Q.E.D.
Have I trespassed on a male prerogative?  We're being followed. I saw him at Trubshaw's ...
I expect we'll have to gatecrash.
Mrs. Peel ... ?
Orders.
Nothing personal.
Why's he called 'Invisible'?
Snuff.  I must insist you try some.
'The Merry Widow?' I might have known. Where's the reception?
If you'd been through what I have, you wouldn't --
Pity your mother came, too ...
I'm no spy -- where do I fit in?
Peter's brother?  But --
Surveillance? By whom?
I fail to see --
Well, I can't possibly go like this.
... and now?
We want Mrs. Peel.
It was you who gave Valentine Peel his security clearance ... you're the mole who betrayed the Ministry.
Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, you should watch out.
Too late anyway. Today's escapade was only for starters. This is no ordinary weather. It's manmade. A kind of weather bomb.
Guilty until proven innocent?
I'm warning you for the last time, Steed: whoever's behind all this, looks like Mrs. Peel, walks like Mrs. Peel and kills like Mrs. Peel.
She was ...
Both, actually.
Ask not for whom the telephone rings ...
Really -- you went with him for two years.
Deb, I want to throw you a shower.
He's not gonna be happy. And your parents can't be too thrilled either.
Rick's got an important announcement to make.
Hey, man, congratulations!
When do the girls get to the party?
Bond... James Bond.
He's gonna hurt you, Debbie. He'll never be true to you the way I would.
So does Debbie.
Maybe it had something to do.
Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?
Thank you, sir.
1002.
Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?
I'm going now, Cole.
Are you going to have women at your party?
Now, I want you to lie down and drift off to slumberland.
Can't I just go with you guys?
How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.
You don't believe me? Okay, fine.
Yes...
Debbie, men are pigs -- if they can have women, we can have men.
What are you talking about, asshole?
Hey. I'm sorry. You want girls. I'll give you girls.
Let's have a toast.
This place should have been wall to wall tits by now.
Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.
Maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while.
What do you mean, it changes?
C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.
All right. Now, there's milk and cookies in the refrigerator. Go to bed right after "Falcon Crest."
I'm trying to slash my wrists.
I couldn't find any razor blades.
It's really not all your fault. I was talking to Mike earlier and he had a lot of problems. Personal things, you know. Made some bad investments. At least now he's peaceful...
Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.
Of course, sir. That explains it. Leather is a very good source of vitamin E.
You can tell a man by his friends.
Knowing Larry, he probably missed the flight.
Nothing... Let's get crazy!
My gift to you.
If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics.
Put it to you this way -- you're gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula, mister.
I don't know.
Got me.
Very.
And here's Mike's partner, in more ways than one. A gal who doesn't think happiness ends with primates. The very lovely, Miss Desiree...
I'm saved. Let's party!
Who?
I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
Get going, Rick... you're late enough as it is.
I don't know.
No.  I need a drink.
It isn't safe, man. Don't go splittin' us up. Not with this one.
Stevie... I...
John, when you're in there... in the fire... do you ever see...
Not likely.
It works.
Yeah? What about Laura --
-- I told you to stay next to me!
Nah, he's nothin'. It's just sometimes... sometimes you just gotta punch somebody out, y'know?
What, are you kidding? By myself?
I waited... I would have fucking waited...
They were for the fucking boat, Brian.
Shut up!
So... I see you're still in the neighborhood.
When I was twenty.
So now you suddenly care about my future?
Hey, sorry if I made you look bad in front of your boss. But I'm not gonna be a poster boy for him, I'm trying to do something here. There's five hundred smoke eaters in this room that do that stuff for real every day. Tell Swayzak to talk to one of them.
...Okay. I'll arrange things with your assignment captain.  Marty's a good man, Brian.
Sorry.  Are you dating anyone?
-- You could have scared the son of a bitch off. We may never bust him now. All for a couple's political points.
I don't have the slightest idea...
Hey, do I know you?
Then who --
I don't have a story.
What?
Trychticholorate.
Sorry, but it's out of my hands. Try again next year.
I just re-wrote your contract. C'mere...
"During heat episodes of 2000 Kelvin or higher, Trych breaks down and dissipates. Will consume magnesium".
What reason?
That's why the sealant on the doors... So what have we got, a torch with a conscience?
Who all ended up wearing candles for faces...  Swayzak's up to his ass in this somehow. Guy can barely hold a drink in his hand, he's so scared.
Like it never happened...
Hi, Helen. Man, you look great.
I know, I know, Should'a called. I've been really busy. I joined the fire department.
And I'm a huge fan of what you did to save that woman, Brian.
Backdraft.
There's no replacement 'cause of your boss' cuts, if that's what you mean. If someone else goes out on an injury we're really screwed.
Management were pin heads.
Coffee sucked.
I was ahead of my time.
Call in another alarm. We're gonna need some back-up.
Fixing my roof.
He's got piano lessons.
The great communicator.
Hey, I'm the first one to admit when I'm wrong.
I don't want to confuse him, Stephen.
How ya doin', Ronald. Staying comfortable?
Wouldn't miss this for the world, pal.
Did he tell you how we finally met?
Just catch the son of a bitch.
Investigator...
Didya ever think of moving to a cheaper apartment? $3,500 a month is crazy, man!
Yeah? At least she's alive! I see people get killed every day! Worse yet, tortured first and then killed! The nuns got off easy. Jeez. Cigarette burns. Everyone's all upset about fucking cigarette burns. I'll show you cigarette burns!
OK. OK. Fine. But -- do you believe in God?
Why?
He wants to know who brought in the chalice.
What the fuck are you? A drug counselor or a drug dealer? And you don't even do your own product! What kind of businessman are you?
Fuck you.  Just give me back a little something for the road.
You can't forgive me. After what I've done.  I've fucked up bigtime. I've been bad. Real bad.
What about the money you owe me on yesterday's game?
How about 7 1/2?
I wanna go double or nothing on the next game.
There's just no way the Mets will lose this game. Gooden is pitching and Strawberry is ready to break out.
Good. I'll give him an extra 10 grand for his trouble. I hate that motherfucking house and --
B-L-A-K it is.
...that simpleton is holding back the race.  They got rid of us and keep those two buffoons, Mantan and Sleep 'N Eat, y'knowwhatI'msayin'?
Ho!
Yeah!
YEAH!
Let's go NIGGERS.
Give me some?
Microphone check.  One.  Two.  One. Two.  One.  Two.  Hold up.  I gots to give my peeps some props. Brothers introduce yourself.
She's also moorish.
Good.  I've got a broken back from carrying you all these years anyway.
Good morning to you, Mr. Delapot.
We're starving.
DeLa, I don't know 'bout this.
To what?
Mantan?  I don't even care as long as I'm dancing.  Which reminds me, I need some new kicks.
Mantan!!
No costume.  No blackface.
Because race has always been a sensitive issue in this country. Gary, I have no problem with people disagreeing with the show, it's when folks start trying to mess with my inherent right as an artist, that's when I get mad.  No one, in any way, shape or form should be censored.
I'm sorry I'm late.
I understand.  But again, in all honesty I was not informed.
I would prefer you not use that word in my presence.
Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  I want a show that will make headlines, that will have millions and millions of households tuned in, glued to their televisions every week.  I want advertisers dying to buy on this show.  I'm gonna squeeze this show out of you if it kills you.
I don't know if Whoopi is the way to go.
Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  Two real coons.  I know we're way out there but it's satire.
So what.  We would just give the NAACP a donation that would be the end of that.  No such thing as bad publicity.  So what.  Earlier you said singing and dancing.
To hire someone solely on their ethnicity, gender or religion is not right.  It's un-American.  I will hire someone who is most qualified for this particular job.
I just want you to meet him.  Keep an open mind.
Derrick Coleman, he possessed all the talent in the world, coulda, shoulda, been a great ballplayer but alas D.C. didn't want it bad enough.  Delacroix, do you want it? Bad enough to kill for it?  Do you want it that much.
We just punched it up a bit.  Made it funnier.
They didn't even view a rough cut, just some scenes we quickly cut together.
Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call.
It's been a long time.
Pleased to meet you.
How did you end up here?
Where do you go from here?
Always keep 'em laughing.
I was a hostess at this club, your Daddy was performing and I had never laughed so hard in my life. He asked me to come with him.  I quit my job and we've been together ever since.
Do you know how you will use him?
You getting cold feet?
Good.  I'm going to need your support.
And lose out on my money?  The only way I get paid is if I get fired. And that's what I intend to do.
My problem is MANTAN THE NEW MILLENIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
What's the chances of MANTAN being picked up?
Hello.
I'm gonna slit my wrists.  Cut my throat.  For the love of Joseph.
What do you want me to say?
I'm sorry, I can't help it.  It's too funny.
To me, it shows part of our history in this country, a time when we were considered inferior, sub-human.
He's just playing big brother.
DeLa, kiss my big black ass.
Now I'm privileged?!  Why?  Because I didn't grow up on food stamps and welfare?  Because I didn't call home a cardboard box?  No, I never ever went to bed hungry and I'm proud of it, too.  Whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you.
Naw.  I'll take the zero.
Sloan, will you take your boss out of here so I can get ready.
Yo, DeLa, they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece.
What you did is dead wrong.
I don't believe it.
My name is Manray, goddamnit.
It looks delicious.
I guess he's still on the road. What kind of show is this?  Are they some Negroes in it without being buffoons?
Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already.
I can't go all the way down south.
Yes I have, very hard.  Has Daddy called?
My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?
I wish I had your natural talent. God only makes that visit once in a while.
A little.  I just graduated from NYU film school.  Cinema studies.
You're welcome.  You shouldn't give up on performing.
Money makes the world go round.  It ain't no joke being poor.  I know whatI'mtalkin''bout. Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?  I've lived on the street.  I've been homeless. I've learned how to play the game, work the game, be in the game.
She hates dem.
My people love me.
You look beautiful like that.
Worked my black ass off, first as an intern, then worked my way up to this position.
Say what, Manray?
You can go now.
That is none of your business.
I'm not afraid of highwaymen.  My man is armed, and so am I.
Ten, sir, and make them short ones, do you hear, Captain Grogan?
I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan. I have had enough of Miss Dugan here and your Irish ways.  I ain't used to 'em, sir.
It's not the English way, for ladies to have two lovers, and, so, Mr. Dugan, I'll thank you to pay me the sum you owe me, and I resign all claims to this young lady.  If she has a fancy for school-boys, let her take 'em, sir.
Oh, yes, of course, Ambassador O'Grady...
The place seems more a farm than an inn-yard.
How do you do, sir?
And his baggage?
Oh, it's with pistols we fight.  You are no match for Best with the sword.
But swords are today impossible; Captain Best is -- is lame.  He knocked his knee against the swinging park gate last night, as he was riding home, and can scarce move it now.
Is Miss Dugan well?
I deny your Grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated?
Your Grace owes me seventy thousand frederics, which I have honorably won.
I have faced that problem before.
Then ordering fresh horses, the Chevalier set off on his journey for that capital.  I need not tell you that I was the Chevalier.
Certainly, monseigneur, does not Your Excellency consider her worthy of love?
Have you had one?
Have you not a man whom you value?
It is nonetheless a misfortune, and you will know it when you love.
I ask only a payment on account today -- after that, you will find me undemanding, obedient and discreet.
My husband has convinced me of the contrary.
Let me give a thousand kisses to that heavenly mouth which has told me that I am happy.
Roderick, you know well enough that I have never loved but you!  Was I ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy? Ever so angry, but the least offer of good-will on your part did not bring me to your side?  Did I not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you in bestowing one of the finest fortunes of England upon you?  Have I repined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it? No, I loved you too much and too fondly; I have always loved you. From the first moment I saw you, I saw your bad qualities, and trembled at your violence; but I could not help loving you.  I married you, though I knew I was sealing my own fate in doing so, and in spite of reason and duty.  What sacrifice do you want from me?  I am ready to make any, so you will but love me, or, if not, that at least, you will gently us me.
But Captain Best is already known as a valiant soldier, and is famous as a man of fashion in London.  It is mighty well of you to fight farmers' boys, but to fight an Englishman is a very different matter.
I'd draw my sword, and cut my way through them.
Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd do.  I'd jump Daisy into the river, and swim you both across, where no enemy could follow us.
Indeed, Miss Dorothy, I intend to have his blood as sure as my name's Roderick.
All right, five hundred guineas.
Well, sir, this nobleman is one of the gentlemen of His Majesty's closet, and one with whom our revered monarch is on terms of considerable intimacy.  I should say you would be wise to fix upon this nobleman your chief reliance for the advancement of your claim to the Viscounty which you propose to get.
Now, just have a little patience, my boy.  Your birthday isn't until next week.
Brooksy was better than you, papa, he used not to swear so, and he taught me many good things while you were away.
Good evening, Mr. James, have you done with my lady?
Black-eyed Sczortarska.
I thought I was gonna have an attack. Go into a fit and bite off my own tongue in the middle of the bayou. Childs could tell I wasn't right.
What do we do?
Maybe he'll be there. Either way, we have to go.
Maybe he's dead too. Maybe you killed them both, Mueller --
We found him like this! Kendall was with me the whole -- Listen to me!
Shut up, Mueller.
Shut up.  West's dead.
We can still come out of this okay. Pike got free, he got a gun, he came after us. That's the story.
They're dead, aren't they?
He's lying.
Did Kendall tell you about the PX?
Yeah --
They would have killed us both. You want me to write a confession, I'll write a confession.
Mr. Hardy, I joined the army for college money. I didn't ask for any of this -- I tried to do the right thing out there and people got killed. You say finding those bodies'll help me, then go find them. I don't want to die.
Do what?
Mueller was alone in the cabin?
Sir, yes, sir!
So did we. Why didn't you come?
I mean I killed him.  Isn't that what we all wanted?
We just want to check your pack --
Oh, come on --
Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --
What don't you know?
Levi, you got about four hours before armed men show up here, put you on a plane to Washington, and lock you in a very small dark room. I suggest you talk to us.
There's that word again.  As I told you, I wasn't in the room when everyone started shooting.
Well?
I was just thinking of what's going to happen to your careers when my father gets through with you.
Because of what I saw.  Who really killed West.
I didn't --
Was dead right. You think Dunbar's on the level?
The Senator...
I wanted to see if he was okay --
Fantastic. You want to tell me what's going on?
Sergeant West's served for twenty- three years. He's the public face of the modern Army.
Hurricane knocked out our Mainframe, so all we have are their dogtags. Cadets Raymond Dunbar and Levi Kendall --
Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio.
See, Ray, this is what we call "good cop, bad cop". She shouts, I stand up for you, you're grateful, a bond of trust is established.
Best time for banal chit-chat.
I lost a bet.
The very same.
So noted.
What point?
Got it.
Have no fear, Osborne, we have not yet begun to fight.
I lied. Wait for it...
I don't know.
What happened next?
What Kendall said -- "the type of guys you don't feel comfortable going to sleep around." That's what Dunbar said about Childs to the letter.
See, I just take your gun to the morgue and fire it into one of their skulls; then I call every newspaper in the country with the story about how Senator Kendall's gay son went nuts on a training mission --
Yeah.
Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
Want company?
I should probably write that down.
In case you need me to testify about the shooting. They'll clear you.
"You're gonna die tonight, faggot". Clear as day.
He whispered it in my ear.
Because he'd shot Mueller.
We've been making progress, I see.
It will and you know why? Because you're not a person anymore, you're a cadet in the United States Army; you have no identity, no Miranda warning, and no rights. So I'm gonna throw you to the wolves, and unlike you, I'm gonna get away with it, because you're pissing me off!
Childs.
Blame the nigger, then, huh? Someone turns up dead, you just look for the darkest face in the crowd --
Still got mine on, not a speck of blood on it. Not a bad trick for a murderer -- you said you burned yours?
The fuck are you talking about --
He asked to see a policeman, we're getting him a policeman.
He tried to burn Dunbar to us. You don't do that if you're not involved.
The army kicked you out for drugs...
Sir, yes, sir!
I just saw the woman I'm going to marry, I know it. But then I lost her.
Fine, I'm doing it.
Don.
My father and I have an advantage. We never talk.
No.
You're pretty good at arithmetic.
I suspect it will hurt a lot.
I'll offer you more than it's worth. And you know you won't have to move. Nothing will change except the name on the deed, you have my word.
Please. Go. Just go.
I know.
Please?
Truth is, I've been thirsty my whole life. Never really known why.
Your mom says I can't tell you that one anymore. You get nightmares.
What did he say?
Really.
I will.
I used to do it when you were gone, remember? I used to do it a lot.
It's rude to talk about religion. You never know who you're going to offend.
What, you're seeing down to my nose? My chin?
The river?
Somehow, you're better. Different. You're getting ready to go. And I say...
Yes. Exactly.
Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?
I am. And you're Will. I've seen your picture, that's how I recognize you. I almost said something at the store, but it would have been awkward.  Like this.
Because he's dying.
Well, therapy. And one day I realized I was in love with a man who could never love me back. I was living in a fairy tale.
I'll help you.
You don't have to.
They met at Auburn.
That's because most of it never happened.
Everyone loves my father. He's a very likeable guy.
Of course.
Yes. But that's a different...
Yes?
Yes. Thank you.
What for?
Yeah. It was quite good actually. Some bits I really liked.
The sets were excellent. Everything was big, you know, all the rubbish, coke cans, sweet wrappers, dustbins, so when you were watching it you felt cat size. It was really clever.
We'll stop then.
It is. I did it cooking.
Name it.
Leave him!
Ch...
Right.
I thought you could give us the tour this morning. Sort of be our Indian Guide.
Plans are for the architects, politicians and so forth.
"I have these uh..." She explains to you... "When I was a little girl my father had these beautiful old glasses." Like... I don't know the word. Like for watching uh... for watching the birds.
You can stay tonight.
Good night.
John.
He says you are very sad ridiculous man. I don't agree of course. And that you must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute. Nadia is a prostitute. I'm sorry.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Sorry?
Of course. They go. Yes. Yes.
It's makes it easier. Okay.
It makes it faster. If I don't speak to the men, they fall faster. It's pretty obvious why.
Well as it turns out I did.
I know you just want to punish me --
Shut up. Have you got your passport?
He left me my passport and ticket. It's pretty clear he wants to see me again.
And that would be Morals. That would be one's own moral sense of decency.
So what did you want? I think we understand each other, no?
You don't understand you either.
Please, there's no... Oh.
Yeah. He's a smashing bloke.
Thank Christ for that.
No.
No.
What was her name?
It's alright.
Please. Why not?
Okay. Promise?
I'm sorry.
It's not mine either.
I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed.
Thanks.
You liked what I brung ya?
That'd be nice.
Can I come in?
These are whipped body creams. It's like a lotion.
Some women prefer not to scent their bodies with perfume. So now they have scented creams. They help moisturize a woman's skin.  This one's my favorite. It's called Ginger Souffle. I recommend... applying the cream while the skin is still damp. So... perhaps just after a shower.
You need a ride?
That's not right, really, cuz I...
Now wait...
I know about how she was like. But we was different. I's the only person she talked to about it. How she's abused. Terrible things, Gill, just terrible...
You think I'm Ronnie's spy or somethin'? Come tomorrow that dumb- ass gonna be halfway round the world tryin' to keep his head on his shoulders. You think he's gonna be thinkin' about you?
Stop what?
That damned, rusty, radiator, bout burned the skin off my legs each time I passed.
Better'n me?
Son, I'm grown. Don't got patience to suffer you children and this monkey junk. I'm too old to play house...  ...and cowboys. So let's have it. End me or get out of my face!
Yes. I mean that's it. I wanna feel like a man with her. I wanna feel like the only man with her.
Two days?
In my house, you watch that lip...
I CAN'T!
I don't fuckin' cook.
Anything.
I'm here with you.
I tried.
Don't think that'd be wise.
I know you didn't. But you a grown girl. You can handle it. I got to.
Woke up real early. Sun was shining. Just thought I'd mess around, try to learn a song.
Maybe I won't.
You collar that dog, boy. I ain't gonna hurt nobody. Just wanted to know who she was.
Nuh-uh.
I didn't start this, R.L.
Don't know if God wanna see me.
He's fine. Just had a bad fall.
Ask the chef.
She's tied to me, R.L.. We tied to each other.
I don't know, but I been told, them Georgia women sweet jelly roll.
Naw... I got it, Mr. Lazarus.  You wanna tip me, best do it in butter beans. Momma say she need a bag 'a yours, none of that store-bought junk. That's what she said.
I gotta ask you. Why do you think Laz is keepin' you chained like this?
So he got it into his head that the only thing gonna keep you from endin' up bleedin' on the side of the road again, without a stitch of clothing on is...  You think he's crazy for thinkin' that?
I'm gonna tell you somethin', and it's just gonna be between you and me.  I think folks carry on about heaven too much. Like it's some all-you-can- eat buffet up in the clouds. And folks just gonna do as they're told so they can eat what they want behind some pearly gates. I can go to Shoney's for that.
Rae...
You feelin' sick?
Holy shit!
All them people shoutin' your name like they were doing tonight! Shit! That arm you got'll get'chu on a box of cereal...
Ronnie. Please, baby...
You never needed nobody. Always made that clear to me.
Only thing I'm sorry for is listenin' to my parents and having you instead of doin' what I should'a done.
What we just did, you askin' for money, make a man stop. I ain't callin' you no ho. But I ain't gonna be played like no trick, neither. Remember... you called me.
What'd I tell you?  I don't do none of that shit no more. I'm in communications now.
So why dive through the glass for a nickel and dime bust?
Let go...
Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked.
Maybe we should do something?
Beats forty hours on a plane.
No.
You said that in the last two places.
What'd she say?
Cool?
Connie...
High spirits, desire, commitment.
What's the problem here?
I don't deserve Ohashi's respect.
I stole them.
You toler -- yes, tolerate me.
Good.  Very good...
It's done.  You don't have to come.
I don't know.
Why's that?
Joyce, give the assistant Chief Inspector a drink, would you?
There was a change in plans.
Why would you care?
I'm taking you back.
Then take it from him.
Incompetent is letting people waltz through a secure area wearing your uniforms, carrying official documents.
It is not allowed.
You're smarter than Kobo.  You know the price of deceit.  Think about it.
You certainly have a nice place here.
I am?
Well, actually
You're androids.
You mean that you can't come here and I can't go there?
I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out of my league.
His company made us.
What was the cover on the one that got Holden?
Soon as I finish the job.
I'm coming to that.  Vulnerable zone is the base of the skull, the occipital bone.  A direct hit is a positive retirement.
And what in your estimation works?
Shot of vodka, please.
Prosit.
Two months.  But this one is not guy.  It is girl.  His girl.
Well, you don't have to worry about getting it wrinkled.
Sorry.
I'm taking a piss.
These aren't just...
They'll change the limit before I change my mind.
Too old.
Of course he's not real.  You think I'd be working here if I could afford a real snake?
And who do I go to about you?
You have a little boy.  He shows you his butterfly collection, plus the killing jar.
I'd never get an abortion.
Can you?  I couldn't.
Right.
Dead.
What?
Like?
I don't like people snooping around my stuff.
I never felt better.
What's a long time?
What's up?
Severed spine.  You'd better get in here.  Bryant's waiting for you.
Memory implant.  She was programmed. But I think she has transcended her conditioning.  I think she was beginning to suspect.
Five, maybe six.
Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay attention.  Answer quickly as you can.
What desert?
But how come I'd be there?
Hi.
I've got stuff.  If you wanna go to my place?
You like it?
Thank-Q!
How do you do?
Fallout shelter. There's a difference.
For how long?
Thank you very much. But, Cliff, that's my seat. And I was just--
Do ya?
Well, your business must not be sports memorabilia, because this one Mantle card right here--  --is worth six thousand dollars all by its little self.
We? I'm going home. And, judging by that coat, I'd say you have to get back to the barber college.
You're lost?
Forget it.  I'm sick of working for that dickhead.
Why doesn't that surprise me?
Well, that changes everything. Get the fuck away from me!!  I mean it!!
So what?!  I've got two of him!  And this many DiMaggios and Robinsons. I was holding these out, too.
Heck, no!  What?!
Perry?
I know a short-cut.
Can't you please just talk to me for one second?
The eyes.  Okay. An eye-man.  Anyhow, it never works out.  Okay?  Not that you even need to know that!  You look like crap, by the way.  What have you been doing?
Hey, no kidding?  In color?
Why does it never work out?  You and...men?
Food and supplies?  Who for?  Like starving people?
How long would you need me?
Sorry.
Hey, you know. I was thinking...
Okay.
Why?!
I told you I've never driven before!
Is this your house?
Well, I know Mom sure likes 'em!
Good for you.
He's gone to check your answers on his computer.
Wazoo!  Try to listen.  Whataya think? Surfer, grunge, hip- hop, Euro trash?
Okay. But you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous, don't you think?
Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a wife? I mean...
Well...yeah. Okay.
Not that one!
And don't be so obvious!
Adam!  She's got bitch written all over her!  You do know what "bitch" means, don't you?
Because we're bitches!  Look at her! Look at the expression on her face! The walk, the jewelry, the fingernails.  Please!
Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end.
Don't change the subject! I want you to tell me the truth about yourself.
But, Eve, I would--
Well, you should be!  Thanks to you, my heart is in my neck!
Goodnight!
Yes!  Yes!  Oh, Lord!  Yes, oh, yes! But  where is the one who came last night -- all in yellow?!
Of course you do.  I'll stay here and pray.
Latin exam, Dad.  It's Tuesday.
Gerade aus dann links!
It's a game, son. I can explain it pretty easily. There's a pitcher.
Uh, no. There's a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat.
No. Sit down.
Blow out the candles!
Shit is a French word?
Yes, father?! Yes?
And, I'm asking you to trust me without understanding why.
Yes. That's kind of how it was.
Yeah.
Well, I think Windows stink. What do you think of that?
I'm not wearing his pants.
I just don't want to.
How 'bout we check with Eve first?
Yeah...Seems to.
I guess living up here makes people look older.
Up there!!
Frozen, they're six-thirty a dozen in the three pound box.
Oh, my holy stars! A Negro!
Good!
I was thinking of selling all the cards.
I'll be all right.
No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's office.
Yes.
And now you must let me be the judge of that!
Let's all remain calm. That's the key thing.
The neighbors over there said the guy spent day and night out here. She'd bring him sandwiches and hot Dr. Pepper.
Yeah.
What?!  A light!  Yes, I've got a light!
You bet, hon!
Yes.
I just hope those plates aren't radioactive by tomorrow morning.
I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days.
The locks.
No.
I'm not hungry.
How could you?! This is just like home!
And I was wondering...if...if I could have a...
No reason.  Well, it's pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the bomb went off. So, you know, when the time is up, we'll have to return to the surface using, you know, this back entrance.  Which is very nice because it has the service elevator!
What?
Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can't be kept.
You bet.
Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!
I don't believe it!
Excuse me.
I thought ten years.
Your stuff?  Let me see that.
Hey, they're Ralph Laurens.  And who's this interesting looking fellow?
Well, that's blunt!
And I suppose you see him in some sort of strapless  thing, don't you?
Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins.
Adam,  I think for you, we should go for "sweet."
Uh..he might of.
Yeah.  I'm not the one who's in love with the guy.
Uh, yes, you do.
You know, I asked him about that. And he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them. See, you'd eat like a slob if you were alone, but since another human being is present, you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners. I didn't know that. I thought it was a way of appearing superior.  Know what else he told me?
Exactly! I thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses. Turns out, the short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is: someone who always attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable as possible. That's it! If you don't do that, nothing else matters. The cars, the clothes, the houses...
He didn't leave with them.
You're goddamn right I am!
Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed.
No, I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.
I'm not sick.
Certainly Frank.  Darling, get some glasses. We'll have some beer with Frank. Won't you sit down?
Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it.
Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
Yes sir. I sure am.
Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.
Nope, it's new stuff. No smell.
I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.
You said hello, to Frank. You wanted to talk to someone? Don? And little Donny. You said something about Momma loves you. And something about a Meadow Lane. Something in an hour. I don't remember any more.
No.
You can kiss them if you want. Feel them. They're getting hard.
Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.
Did I say that? I didn't mean it, or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.
Who's it, you mean.
Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?
Hello.
Frank is coming?
That's good.
I'm doing it.
No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. Go to the police.
Does that scare you?
No, it's not Don.
There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. There is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. In every hole. It's opening me to a death.
I did. Are you?
Why are you here?  HMMMMMMMM!!!! OK.
Okay. Soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
He's a friend. From the neighborhood. We were just talking.
You want to see him too, right?
Those are my breasts.
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. To make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue, blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
FUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!!
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
No. No thank you.
That sounds great!
I'll get a coat for her.
I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean, no offense.
I mean, some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
Uh-uh.
It's good to see you, Dad.
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
Yes.
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it?
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. And a musician. And some others.
No, this has been going on for some time. Several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body, only parts.
Yeah. It's close by, that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
You didn't goof it up, but you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday, do you have a date tonight?
Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.
Leave it in the front of your house for me, okay?
Are you sure?
He got a little jealous.
It's okay. Don't worry about it.
I don't see how I can, and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. Also it could get you in trouble.
Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl.
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
Yeah, you're a mystery. I like you. Very much.
Yes. Is that so surprising? Yeah I worry, a lot. I got you into this.
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
Where to?
Yeah, nice meetin' you.
Well he's the one shooting up all his guys, right? He's scared of the kid. Says he's real good, got every available gun in the city up there.
Mother Mary, full of grace.
Aye.
Got it.
Where's your gun?
He probably knew you'd end up nailing the fat guy, maybe one or two more, but he had to know you weren't walking out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's dead on the scene. No in-depth investigation. It'd slide right off his back. 'Cause as much as I love ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone. What would he be losing? A thirty- five year old delivery boy?
MEEE! ME! I'm the guy! I know everyone, their habits, where they hang out, who they talk to. I know where they fuckin' live. We could kill everyone!
You won't do it Connor, you won't. You love me man.
Be careful.
Aye.
How many?
Lord have mercy. That was a good one ma.
"We just got up and left. Bum musta rolled them before the police got there."
Italian.
German.  Not in our neighborhood, man. A hundred percent Irish. No one talks to cops. Period.
...so that which is good may flourish
For what?
All right, get the stupid fuckin' rope.
We'll find it. Just calm down.
He's a good man.
It is your corrupt we claim.
Now look Rozengurtle, we're sorry. Just relax.
Uh... two shooters!
Of course they were. How many?
No. This guy is big time.  These two are street-walking scum.
How do you figure?
Really want to know?
New hitman wants to leave his mark
They shot him at a downward angle.  They put him on his knees.
What about one guy with two guns?
What?
Why was I not informed of this?
Well, we didn't get any help on that. A lot of people saw it. Nobody's talking.
Brilliant. So now we got a Huge guy theory and Serial crusher theory. Top fucking notch.  What's your name?
Shit! Shit!
Why don't you let me do the thinking, huh, genius?
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
Well, what'ya do?
What the fuck do you mean?
Then you must find out what your beliefs are.
Just go!
I caught your show down at the velvet room at the Holiday Inn, loved it when you busted into Viva Las Vegas.
He's not there. Huggie Bear isn't in every single episode.
As part of his plan. I don't know why.
The point is the killer always goes, May I speak to Starsky? He says his name.
No. This is he.
Would they do that?
See, your mind is very good with the more mechanical details. Whereas my strength would be --
But Dignan, do you really know that much about rare coins?
Nothing. Go ahead.
You're right. You're right.
Oh, shit. That was scary. In the middle of the robbery. The manager looks at me. Right in the eye. And goes, I'm going to remember you.
I don't like to use that credit card, Dignan.
Look at the treads on those.
They obviously weren't designed for racing.
What. What's the matter?
No, no. Look. OK. Let's stay here until we find out what's going on.
This was in fourth grade.
Yes... It's true.
This morning.
You were asleep.
Can you hand me those french fries.
I don't know, Dignan. I just --
Dignan. I can't do that. All right? I just can't.
Don't panic, Anthony.
How much?
That's Applejack. You want to meet him?
Who's Mr. Henry?
Easy, Dignan. It's OK.
What the fuck are we doing out here?
I'm sorry, Bob.
I don't think you will.
Yes. I do.
Any activity?
Stand by, Bird Dog.
Careful. Check his pulse.
I don't know.
Let's go. Come on.
Applejack's stuck in the elevator?
I don't think so. I mean. Actually, he robbed Bob's house.
I'm not kidding.
Pretty much everything.
We're not sure.
Thanks.
Yeah. Convert it into lofts. OK. Pop quiz. What's the single most important aspect of your job?
I'm not really sure. I think it's Irish. Or maybe --
I don't think you're giving him enough credit. I know sometimes he doesn't think an idea through. He gets too excited. But --
Take a deep breath.
Yes, he did.
I don't want to die.
But he's got a loud bark. That's the most important thing is a loud bark.
Let them fight.
Yeah. He said that.
What was that?
Move.
Cause I'm not getting any better. It's a waste of time.
Sixty days?
Dies y nueve.
Cuba.
God, yes. Like silk.
Uh-uh.
That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.
It's true, Dignan.
Good question.
You're paranoid, Bob.
He electrocuted someone?
That's true. That would give me nightmares.
My brother's in jail.
Well, obviously, we got to go back.
I'm going back.
His name's not Future Man, Dignan.
What is it?
That's right. I only have one vote. We'll go talk with Anthony and figure it out.
I don't want to fight you, Dignan.
That's OK.
Who's watching the door? What the fuck are you doing? Get back in position.
He's having a heart attack or something.
I didn't think there was an alarm.
Here we go.
Social issues. Crime prevention.
This is Anthony Adams, Mr. Henry.
I don't know. Are you in, Anthony?
Well, I think --
In the cash register. Step away from the door.
No. I just have short hair.
Sure.
Si. Tecate. You like to fight?
Pleasure to meet you, John.
One last push. One.
Bourne comes here? Why?
He does. I've been down to the archives. I have the files, Ward.
What happened? Jason Bourne happened.  You've got the files? Then let's cut the crap. It went wrong. Conklin had these guys wound so tight they were bound to snap. Bourne was his number one -- guy went out to work, screwed the op and never came back. Conklin couldn't fix it, couldn't find Bourne, couldn't adjust. It all went sideways. Finally there were no options left.
So what's your theory?  Conklin's reaching out from the grave to protect his good name?  The man is dead.
And you do? From the moment he left Treadstone, he has killed and eluded every person that you sent to find him...
Hold on -- he said he wants to come in.
I wasn't sleeping.  You OK?
I'm sorry, Ward.
I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.
'Why' would be enough for me.
And pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it.
Lots of people...
No, I do.
Yes...
You're a liar.
I can't let you do that either.
I don't know! Why would I lie?
I did.
-- take the back -- get another car --
No. There's nothing new.
It's wrong. Guy with a rental car and hundred dollar sneakers sleeps in a tent?
Where are you going?
It wouldn't have changed the way you feel.
I left a fingerprint! You fucking people.
Please -- I'm only here because of Paris -- because they can't figure out what you're doing -- I'm here because of Abbott --
Your first assignment was Geneva.
I want to come in.
Then get a number, they need to know who they're dealing with.
What?
What? The tapes?
Who's this?
Yes, sir -- ma'am...
You were his local contact. You were with him the night Conklin died. You're coming with us.
If you say so.
These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans.
It's got caffeine in it. That's all I know.
No. Munich's a bust. He's loose.
We just had a funeral, isn't that what it means in England as well?
I don't want to leave.
Saying goodbye in their own way -- in outlawed tartans, with outlawed pipes, playing outlawed tunes.
He has already agreed to come.
My father hears that Longshanks has granted prima noctes.
I have ordered conscriptions...
So the Scots will have none of them, will they? My armorers have already made a thousand.
Before he lost his powers of speech, he told me his one comfort was that he would live to know Wallace was dead.
Fourteen? --
My dreams of Marion are gone. I killed them myself. If I knew I could live with her on the other side of death, I'd welcome it.
Aye, we'll get 'em.
The test of a soldier is not in his arm. It's here.
That depends on the man.
I will not.
We don't split up!
He broke because of me. I saw it. He lost all will to fight.
Shall I leave, M'lord?
This is what happens when you must send a woman. And a fool.
Against thy king, thou vile fool! Hast thou anything to say?
He shouldn't be telling secrets in bed.
...I wouldn't know.
Wife of Edward, the king's son?
York was the staging point for every invasion of my country. And that royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, even women and children, from the city walls.
I have taken vows. More than one. I've vowed faithfulness to my husband, and sworn to give him a son. And I cannot keep both promises.
Sir, I... come to beg you to confess all, and swear allegiance to the king, that he might show you mercy.
I must... consult with my father.
No English lord would trust an Irishman!
Aye. But it won't let me dream.
It could be extremely useful to jog his memory. See if he remembers anything new the next day. And I'll have the test results back in a few days.
Well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but I've been putting it off.
Nine, ten. And you're awake! Open your eyes, dammit!
Thanks. Don't worry Evan, you'll have plenty of time.
You'll be fine. Dr. Redfield just wants to give you some tests. You'll like him.
Great. I'll see you soon.
Don't try to use your blackouts to get out of this one!
Sure...
What? What could he do?
Damn it, Mom. I told you I need them all!
He's saying it's like forty years worth of new memories have been jammed in my brain since last year. Overload city. 'Sat about the gist of it, doc?
No, protecting her.
Lemme guess. Would that be where the memories are stored?
My journals! Where are they?
Like Ozzy.
All I know is that I might be able to unblock some of my repressed memories.
Sorry, dude. Just figured it'd be okay with you bein' sick and all.
You really don't remember anything that happened?
Hi, Lenny.
I'm going to State now. Things are going okay. I guess. Mom's good...
I've stopped a hundred times.
They kept him in juvy for a few years. Now he works over at Dale's Autobody.
Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?
Of course.
What do you want to know, Evan?
Might'a been nice.  Like this is gonna do any good. Maybe one of the frat guys has a gun.
What?
Evan. Stop it. It's not the time.
No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. I've been where you've been.
Why's that?
Yeah?
Shit. I dunno. How would I know about the twin moles on your inner thigh?
I'm over it. Whenever I try to help anyone it all turns to shit.
Sure, Evan, why not? You were the first person I really ever cared about.
Well a lot of things cross my mind. I've always been a fast thinker, Ev. I can play out the movie of our entire lives in under a second. Boom -- we fall in love -- get married -- two kids, your keen analytical insight matched to my generous nature -- kids grow old as do we, relatively stable relationships, matching burial plots, the whole bit. It took a lot longer to spit out than to imagine.
And I'll tell the Child Protective Services about your kiddie porn endeavors. One step closer and I'll shove this up your ass!
Been there, done that.
Bullshit. I'll send you a postcard when I've made everything perfect again.
I still owe you an essay from last week. Is there any way I could get an extension?
Deal. Now read me something.
Maybe because they never do.  So Don Juan, you pass out on all your dates?
Sure. I was gonna make a new one, anyway.
Yeah, good, what else do you remember?
My mom packed for me. I think she sent everything I ever owned. So we'll see.
What happened?? Where are we?!
It wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think I was a piece of shit.
Right, Evan. I believe you just said "sick fuck."
Huh?
I come from a big family.
I don't think Evan gets to be in it --
I'm sorry.
What? No frigging way, man. I'm not touching that thing.
Yeah, you do that, Lenny.
-- Will he keep his word?
-- He's just a lucky guy.
As you see, it was true every single time. Thank heaven I found you, Berger. I am looking for a man by the name of Ugarte. He is supposed to help me.
Maybe I won't have to. A bribe has worked before. In the meantime, everybody stays on salary.
I will. Then I am going to the meeting of the --
I won't.
Come up here a minute.
Er, my check, please.
No hurry. I'll have it sent over. Have a drink with me.
Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into your confidence. You need a partner.
I shall remember to pay it... to myself.
As leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca, I am an influential and respected man. It would not be worth my life to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo. You, however, are a different matter.
You needn't be concerned about me.
What are they?
He hasn't played it in a long time.
In America they'd bring only a penny. I guess that's about all they're worth.
It's funny about your voice, how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it. "Richard dear, I'll go with you any place. We'll get on a train together and never stop."
I don't think I will, Rick.
The stairs from the street.
You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.
-- I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship.
When did you first find out he was alive?
I don't know. I ain't seen him all night.
Be careful.
I meant to, but something always held me up. I love you very much, Ilsa.
Yes. He said, "Ask your wife." I don't know why he said that.
Thank you. I try.
Any time.
Signor Ferrari is the fat gent at the table.
Thank you.
You seem to know all about my destiny.
Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?
Good. I've got the letters right here, all made out in blank.
I'm going to anyway, because it may make a difference to you later on. You said you knew about Ilsa and me.
Very well.
Are you quite finished with us?
Then we shall state another time and another place. Tomorrow at ten in the Prefect's office, with Mademoiselle.
Yes, even in Berlin. If you will furnish me with their names and their exact whereabouts, you will have your visa in the morning.
Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for eloquence which I can now understand. But in one respect you are mistaken. You said the enemies of the Reich could all be replaced, but there is one exception. No one could take your place in the event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape.
Oh, we Germans must get used to all climates, from Russia to the Sahara. But perhaps you were not referring to the weather.
By the way, the murder of the couriers, what has been done?
Well, personally, Major, I will take what comes.
Perhaps.
My dear Major, we are trying to cooperate with your government, but we cannot regulate the feelings of our people.
I have no conviction, if that's what you mean. I blow with the wind, and the prevailing wind happens to be from Vichy.
I see what you mean.
But I have no excuse to close it.
I stick my neck out for nobody.
Perhaps not.
Okay.
Louis, whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape?
Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here.
That was some going-over your men gave my place this afternoon. We just barely got cleaned up in time to open.
Put it down as a gesture to love.
I am shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!
Because one, you've bet ten thousand francs he'd escape. Two, you have the letters of transit, now don't bother to deny it. And, well, you might do it simply because you don't like Strasser's looks. As a matter of fact, I don't like him either.
Don't count too much on my friendship, Ricky. In this matter I'm powerless. Besides, I might lose ten thousand francs.
What friend?
Serves me right for not being musical.
You think of everything, don't you?
Anyway, thanks for helping me out.
Good evening, Mr. Blaine.
Hello Ugarte.
They got a lucky break. Yesterday they were just two German clerks. Today they're the 'Honored Dead'.
For a price, Ugarte, for a price.
I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one.
I like it fine here.
Yeah, but I ain't got time to spend the money I make here.
Yeah?
No.
No.
Yeah, boss?
No, I don't.
Six kilometers.  Four miles.
The failures they remember.  It's the successes they forget.
You've had today's water.
Do too much, I'll die.
Take it, damn it.
Survive today, that's the point.
Thank you for fucking up my life.
I'm dancing on the roof of the Peabody Hotel.  With Kelly.
Possible.  So you did those wings?
I didn't steal it, and he wasn't crippled.
You want to.
I know.
That's my sea anchor.  My second one. Made it out of part of the sail.  It keeps you from capsizing in a storm.  In theory.  And this, this I used to collect water. About half a cup a day.
Yeah, well...couldn't be helped.
Your calendar, your cell phone, your whoo pig sooey hat, some pictures of that ketch you wanted.
Under the circumstances your overall health is good.  Those salt water boils you picked up on the raft are ulcerated, but they're healing nicely.
You are aware of the potential disruptiveness on your loved ones when you return to your old life?
No.
Sixty three pounds consumed per capita, up from twenty seven in 1960.  Going to pass beef.  Chicken's global.  No religious taboos.  You don't see your Hindus and your Muslims boycotting poultry.
Mom, meet Jango.
This is my home.  I'm part of the wallpaper.
The tide saved me, Mom.  I lived by it. I'm just wondering where it will take me next.
Kamal, you're breaking up.  Can you hear us?
What about the sender?
What's going on down there?
Borrowed.  I borrowed it.
What?  Let Paris hold its plane?  Let Memphis take care of it?  Let somebody down the line clean up your mess?
You know General McLelland, he wouldn't attack unless he had everything just right.  Finally Abe Lincoln came to him and said, General, if you're not going to use my army, could I borrow it for a while?  So he gave it to Grant and Grant just said, let's go.
Take the plunge, admit your mistakes, move on to tomorrow.  That's FedEx, that's women, that's life.
Ninety five percent?  Just give me the money now.
We're on.
I'm most definitely not dead.  And as I recall, you're the sick fucker.
I braided them.
Forty-three days.
What's it all about?  It's about being so thirsty you'd crush a fish's backbone to suck out the spinal fluid -- that's what it's about.
Try to think of nothing, Dorothy.
Let him try to *make* some money! That's part of "seeing the world," isn't it?
Dr. Homer Wells.
It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to.
He's a doctor, Buster--doctors smell like ether.
They'll believe it because they want to believe it.
He mentions Homer, too, you know.
Really?
Sure... I'll see you around.
I'm *never* bored! It's all very... different for me... here.
Okay...
I don't think Mr. Rose would leave without you.
I *did* like it. All I said was, "It's not 'King Kong'."
Well, she was in a weakened condition...  I don't know! What about "King Kong"?! Is that medically possible?
Yes... and no. When you come here, you don't really care about the movie.
I never *asked* for any responsibility.
Ah-ha.  So what is that--a radio?
Right.
It will be okay.
Mr. Rose *knows*?
Nothing.
No. Nothing is nothing. I want Wally to come home. I'm afraid to see him, too.
You say that as though it's some awful thing!  I never stopped loving Wally!
Sure. Thanks.
No. It ain't Muddy. Muddy's just...
Well, they aren't.
He *loved* it!  Didn't you?
Dr. Larch wouldn't let just anyone take *any* of us!
How old are you, dear? Thirteen?
You *bet* it's a heavy sedation! The fetus is unexpelled, her uterus is punctured, she has acute peritonitis, and there's a foreign object. I think it's a crochet hook.
Well, we can only guess about that, Edna. They *are* against the law.
Edna! Come dance with me! Let's be foolish tonight.
Uh, sure--that's what Kong thinks, all right.
Have you enlisted?
I don't *have* any time. There's a *war*!
Is it true?
Yes, for both.
I haven't read that.
Can't a boy be a Dorrit?
You do it then.
It's *your* splice! You blame me for everything!
Try to look at it *this* way. Buster and I are sitting right here beside you. We could have ended up in the incinerator!
You know I'm grateful for everything you've done for me...
It's your heart--you ought to take it with you.
I don't know.  Just promise me one thing.
Not yet. What do you know about it?
*Happy*! What are you thinkin'? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I can't have a baby.
You think so, Jack? Well... I wouldn't want to be in that Wally's shoes tonight.
Them people drinkin' that cider, they don't know there's a cigarette in there!
You mean *swimmin'*. I ain't goin' in that vat to fish out no cigarette!
Then I suppose we can look forward to catching various diseases from him!
Anyway, I was just showing you this guy as an example of what's available-- I didn't think you'd be interested.
Why was he missing for twenty days?
Who *live* here in this cider house, Peaches? Who grind them apples, who press that cider, who clean up the mess, and who just plain *live* here... just breathin' in the vinegar?  Somebody who *don't* live here made them rules. Them rules ain't for *us*. *We* the ones who make up them rules. We makin' our *own* rules, every day. Ain't that right, Homer?
That's right. I know you understand how I feel, Homer--you is breakin' them rules, too. Ain't that right?
You oughta know you don't go to jail for cuttin' a guy's *clothes*. Ain't that right, Homer?
You gotta let me go, Daddy. Please...
He ain't never been outta Maine!
Uh, Maker's Mark. Rocks.
That's right. So, brainiacs that we are, we thought we'd be innovative and relocate east. Try our luck with a straight corporate loan out here.
Well, typically, corporate loans are relatively simple matters, but you do need to demonstrate a capacity for gross fund recovery.
We know exactly how we're going to make the money back. There in lies the Catch-22
I know. It won't go unnoticed.
Jake? Right. Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Yeah, it's going through --
Know who I am, Jake?
No. I'm not the Anti-Christ. Or the Prince of Darkness. I'm just a guy looking for some answers.
Just the last three weeks.
You never know when you can use a crooked cop.
So you want to know how to play the Big Con.
The cash we fleeced off of him was collection money. He was supposed to take that money and give it to the King earlier yesterday like he does every Thursday. 'Cept this time, he figured he could make a little something for himself off us and still get the King's money back before any body says "boo."
You're pissed we didn't get credit?
Alright, let's all put our dicks back in our pants for a second. Is this the best thing to do?
I gotta work off some of this adrenaline. I got a line on this Pawn Shop guy over in Brooklyn. Anybody want in?
I guess. I gotta drop a dime. Did anybody mess up the hoop?
I just don't know if this says, "me". What's the fabric?
She's up for it.
You know, back in the day, grafting was considered a gentleman's racket. Good suits, good food... The Underworld of the Underworld. A grifter had to survive on his wits, his instincts... I like that. I like the idea of that. These days, things being what they are, guys like me gotta stay low. It's all take, take, take. You can't just be fucking witty about it.
I'll get the money back, plus interest. I go on the grift for you. You get a cat, I get a cut. And we get square.
You ask a lot of questions. Come on.  Let me see 'em.
I need you to stake me. I can't do it without it. It's just a couple hundred grand. Taken out of our cut when we're done.
I think I just broke my hand.
Tip was fine, Jake. We were a little more curious about the Fed.
Something stupid.
Oooh. Sassy. What do you care who feels me up, Jake? Unless it kinda gotcha going. Did it, Jake? Getcha going?
I'll worry about Customs.
You're just going to have to trust me.
Honey, this is Mr. Lewis. Carolyn Lewis's father. Mr. Lewis, this is my wife, Lily.
Lighten up.
What about this? Do you have any idea what this means? You've killed us. We're dead!
Are you asking me if I have something to prove?
Intuition.
Then he grabbed me and threw me down on the floor, that really cold linoleum tiled hospital floor and started ripping my uniform off.  He said he was going to "fuck some sense into me."
No, I'm not going to take it easy. You can't stay clear of this guy. He will be on this until the end of time.
What are you talking about? Yes we have. And we would have been beautiful about it. We would've had a bucket of chicken delivered to the King with a nice kiss my ass card attached to it. Then we woulda moved on 'til the next local putz caught on.
You sure?
There is no scam! I've got a fucking sign on my back! I can't leave town now and come back with a suitcase full of money. You get it? It's over. We walk.
And we got rid of the red head.
You're sure? This is... Just a complete disaster.
That's no problem. We have those in stock.
With identification.
My fucking heart bleeds.
I saw you go up from the Knecker, working that Grind, learning the Barnard's Law and I thought, "the kid's a prodigy." But I know that if you're using these goods... So then I figure, what's worth that? You're either looking for a little history or a retirement fund. Who's the Mark?
I want him for something big and to do that, we have to catch him in the act.
What are you talking about?
What's the Blue Book price?
I'm not a mathematician. I'm in business.
Hey. I've got an idea. Why don't we...
Not particularly.
You want me drunk?
I owe you for the rent. It's only a car. I can get another.
Come on, Marion. Let's face the truth. Nobody's going to publish it.
Don't play the cop with me, Marion.
Probably.
Haven't you got a conscience of your own?
Now wait a minute. What's so hopeful about your job? Spending the day catching poor people stealing. You said yourself the organised gangs get away with it. At least in the casino everybody gets caught. Rich or poor, the odds are the same. It's all relative.
I thought you wouldn't want to spend Christmas Day alone in here.
All right, dad. Yes, I'll call him.
You know where I'm from?
In the casino.
Just an accident. Nothing.
I don't have any money.  switches on the light. JANI is looking distressed.
No thank you.
It's a shame there aren't more men in the world like you.
Have I?
Turn left at the lights.
Over the river.
You've done pretty well.
No thanks, Matt. I need my eight hours.
Don't worry.
Rough life, Jack.
Wait a minute. You got yourself barred.
Jack.
Any exceptions?
What happens if I want to sneeze?
It's a rule. Always stand by your first count. The odds are you're right.
I don't gamble, Mr Reynolds.
We had the same rule at Sun City, but it was impossible to check.
Fine.
Jack, you're not the usual type we get here.
All right, Mr Reynolds.
Eventual supernova.
Look, bomb...
Key? Key? What is the key?
The key!
Doolittle, are you there?
Time to start talking.
Not much. Nothing at all in this sector.
All right, then...
Check at six minutes.
Bomb #20 to Sergeant Pinback. Roger, I read you, continue.
Energy shielding positive function.
I am always receptive to suggestions.
In other words, all I really know about the outside universe relayed to me through my electrical connections.
Intriguing. I wish I had more time to discuss this matter.
Of course not.
I said I'm trying to reach Talby. Something's wrong with the damn intercom. I need a last-minute diameter approximation.
I need a computer reading on a fail- safe mark.
Boiler, can you set me up with some temp figures?
Which one?
What?
Who cares. Don't bother me.
Out where?
Who cares?
-- remove thrust drive repellant --
Yeah, Doolittle. What's up?
Okay, Doolittle, I'll have it in a minute.
They are a body of asteroids that make a complete circuit of the universe once every 12.3 trillion years. The Phoenix Asteroids... From what I've heard, Doolittle, they glow... glow with all the colors of the rainbow. Nobody knows why. They just glow as they drift around the universe. Imagine all the sights they've seen in the time they've been travelling -- the birth and death of stars, things we'll never see. The universe is alive, Doolittle. I thought it was all empty, but it isn't. In between the stars, it's seething with light and gasses and dust. There are little pebbles drifting around, planets no one on Earth has ever seen... No one but the Phoenix Asteroids...
I think I'm getting a malfunction here somewhere.
Sounds good, Talby. Let me know if anything important comes up.
Sh, Talby, don't bother me now.
Here I am. I think I'm spinning... We're both falling, Talby, in opposite directions, away from each other. My -- my jetpack's gone.
Bomb must have gone off inside the ship. Nothing we can do about it now. Hey, it looks like... the skipper. He made it. Commander Powell made it!
I'm glad you've come to talk with me, Doolittle. It's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me.
Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing?
What was that, Doolittle?
Ah... it seems to me, Doolittle... Sorry, I've drawn a blank. Hold it. I'll have it again in a minute. I forget so many things in here, so many things. Hold on, just a minute, let me think...
Oh, yes, Doolittle, I'm thinking.
Yeah, the skipper always was lucky.
Yeah?
You haven't figured this out yet, have you?  You walk in here thinking you're gonna cap her then cap me and take the money back to your boss with your tail wagging... But see it's really the other way around.  You think I'm the whack, when actually you're the whack.
What the hell are you doing?
I'm really glad we're having this conversation.  You're right.  I was angry at you.  But talking about it-- The scales have fallen from my eyes and I see now that it was all my fault.  Can you ever forgive me?
What?  Where're we going?
No way.
Don't look down.
So you just decided to return it to the sender.  Or, in this case, the sender's wife.
It concerns only Jah.  But, in this case, I was the instrument of the Most High.
Theo rode for this place a long time, man.
Thought I'd let you have first crack... Later.
I ain't mad at you...
Thanks, it's starting to kick in.  I feel almost human.
And for all his cattin' around, not much of a stick man either.
Just thought maybe he'd like a little coffee with his saliva.
Can you help me get her back?
Then how come last night I heard you talking to Logan and you were crying?
Guess it wasn't the pizza delivery guy.
Whoever that is.
The goddess who comprehends all goddesses, eye of Ra, protector, avenger, and destroyer, giver of life, who lives forever... I could keep going.
You're that nervous, you're welcome to stay here.
Only when I meet someone I have to know everything about.
The other ones?
The bar code on your neck, Max.  I know who you are and I know who you're running from.
How well do you remember the lab?
Somebody's got to.
Look, thank you for this but--
You don't want to.
She may be easy on the eyes but she's trouble, trust me.  Hot run to two-oh-two Sansomme.
Any idea when she'll be back?
With me, where he's been after work, three, sometimes four nights a week for the last two months... We have what you might call an intimate relationship.
Let go of my hand.
You did.
My name's not kid.  It's client.  As in the person who pays for your opulent lifestyle.  Now, you got something for me or not?
Only a last name would be nice.  Or the nearest town to this...clinic.
One-seven-four-nine-five Natoma.
You're not seriously buying into Darren's nonsense.
Pull the cash.
You're the best, Maxie.
We gotta talk.
I know what you're thinking.  But the truth is, this other person is not someone I'm in love with.  As a matter of fact, after what she just did, she's not even someone I like much.  So in a technical sense, I'm not sure you could call me and her cheating...officially.
Lame, self-serving, arrogant...guilty as charged.
You don't.
You were trying to have it both ways and you were being completely selfish.  And if I ever find out you're going out the back door on Natalie again, you're the one who's gonna be hanging by your ankles three stories up.  Understand?
Theo's dead.
You're too kind. I'm Amanda.
Better ease up then, Hawk. Wouldn't want to give you whiskey dick would we?
Hawk.
Yeah, a man's drink...
You're not gonna chicken out on me now, are you? We've got your KISS song playing and everything.
It's okay.
Right, slow...
My dad's company is relocating him. We're moving. That's why I was acting so freaky in school today. I thought it was the last time I'd ever see you. Anyway, open the box. I would have given it to you this morning, except... like I said, I was freaking out.
Bye.
One more time in English.
YO, DOOFUS!
Check!
Never mind with the too bad shit. I got a crazy plan, but only the craziest among us can pull it off.
So? Your mom's car has a CB, radar detector and cruise control, check?
The hypothetical temperature characterized by the absence of heat and even the slightest amount of molecular activity? Yeah, I'm vaguely familiar
...Holy shit! I am in absolute trouble! I never should have let you drive, man! Absolute fuckin' trouble!
Four dudes sneaking in? We'd get busted fer sure. Bad plan.
All right. After school we double- time it to your house for the tix before heading to the train station for the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City.
Well, couldn't you slow down so I can at least state my case, Hawk? If you don't like it, you can speed up and I'll never mention it again.
Christine stole it! Asleep, my ass! The stella booted with your mom's wheels.
Uhh... nothing.
Besides, those jeans are so tight I can see your penis.
You mean, you're sending me to... b- b-boarding school?
I said, I'm sorry!
You're one to talk, Lex. Your mom's a fuckin' dyke.
Yeah? I have a saying too, Lex. It goes, "Catch my jizz in your mouth and stop jinxing us, asshole." We're going this time and that's all there is to it.
A likely story. Hand it over, kid.
A tag on your toe. Nobody threatens me and lives.
It's not nearly enough, punk.
Yeah.
Yeah.
A metal craft of any kind.
Like a spear.
If God controls time... then all time is pre-decided. Then every living thing travels along a set path.
If you could see your path or channel growing out of your stomach, you could see into the future. And that's a form of time travel, right?
When you fall asleep tonight, I'm gonna fart in your face.
Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about.
Go home. Go home and tell your parents that everything is going to be just fine.
I'm not. But you should check your backpack 'cause those guys like to steal shit.
He stabbed my mom four times in the chest.
Yeah. And right now there's some fat guy over there watching us.
Infant Memory Generators.
And inside these glasses are these slide photographs. And each photograph is of something peaceful... or beautiful. Whatever pictures the parent wants to put inside.
The whole movie. Let's go.
Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.
Fear and love are the deepest of human emotions.
When did you stop taking your medication?
We will not have this kind of language at the dinner table.
I stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade, Mom.  Get out of my room.
Then why don't you start taking the goddamn pills?
How does it feel to have a wacko for a son?
Well... they say it right when they are ripping the place to shreds. When they flood the house. That like... destruction is a form of creation. So the fact that they burn the money is... ironic. They just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart.  They want to change things.
Why should I mourn for a rabbit like it was a human?
Would you like to talk about this friend?
How so?
Into the future.  Then he said that the world was coming to an end.
No.  That's stupid.
Yes.
No, I don't think about fucking my family. That's sick!
Four times... so far.
I don't know. Gretchen has a theory. That Frank is a sign. I told her I thought it was ridiculous.
It was just like she described them in her book. Like they were alive. The way that they looked... moved... smelled. They were like workers... assigned to each one of us.  I followed my spear... and I found something...
But you were punished.
Do you wish that you were punished by your parents instead?
Frank is going to kill.
Because you tell Mom everything.
Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication.
But let me remind you that this treatment is... experimental.
How did you know --
Rose, I'll tell you this because our daughters have been on dance team together for two years and I respect you as a WOMAN. But after witnessing your son's behaviour today, I have... significant doubts...  Our paths through life must be righteous. I urge you to go home and look in the mirror and pray that your son does not succumb to the path of fear.
But now you can't go.
She's alive, sweetie.
Really, Loretta?
Thank God for bunge cords.
Really?
Airport Ho-Jo!
Okay, sweetie, that's all right. Let's go. Let's go.
No, don't say it. Another stray bullet to the head.
Mom, look, don't say anything. First of all, I'm not pregnant.
Would yous boys excuse us a second? Loretta, you too.
Oh my God! My -- my tap costume's gone.
Amber Atkins! That is not American Teen Princess language!
Bitch!
Yah -- I brought her some flowers this morning. She's in the room next to my mom. She's super happy.
Yes...
Hi.
Oh, naw. Hi.
Shut it up, Loretta.
I'll be right back. See ya later.
Anyone?
It smells funny. Like gasoline.
That's right.
Mm-hm.
Oh yah-sure, I know what some of your big city, no bra wearin', hairy- legged women's libbers say, "Pageants are old-fashioned" and, uh, and "demeaning" to the girls --
"U.S.A. is A-okay."
"Can I? I'm Amer-I-Can!" People ask me where I get this. I don't know, it's... maybe a gift from God or somethin'.
Tammy Curry?
Sammy Davis, Jr., honey.
Oh, my!  Hello, Father Donigan! Sidewalks, sidewalks?
I said I'd move if a cripple came. Let's just run in the store and pick out some outfits.
Shut up, Hank. This here's business.
I want to have the big bag of little donuts.
The king can do no wrong!
The king can do to wrong!
Take a letter.
The President of the United States.
"My President"...
Is that all?
Never mind His Excellency -- you gotta your pocketbook?
I wanna powder my nose...
I no gotta new-rosis.  My uncle he's- a got a flower shop -- he's-a gotta new-rosis.
Then you don't wanna work hard?
Well, if you wanna work in the post- office you'll have to stick out your tongue.
I've got just the job for you -- Secretary of War.
I don't want to buy ammunition -- we no gotta war.
I think we oughtta have a standing army, so we can save money on chairs.
By the way, are you sure we need a spy?
I don't know about us, but I know he's-a got something...
That's all right.  We let you have twenty-five thousand men -- and we both start even.
Oh, sure.  We have horse maneuvers every morning.
That's-a pretty good.  I'll take a dozen of them.
Fine.  We gotta him.
Fine - keep on yelling - Do everything you can to disturb Firefly - Now what about your cousin?
All right -- I'll go out and find one.
The husband steps outside; Relinquishes his bride; We stand him up against the wall And take him for a ride.
This is a fine thing to be doing at my age.
Not at all.  When I was a boy back on the farm I used to pump my own water.
I bring you the greetings of my President and the good will of my people.
Twenty million dollars is a considerable sum...  I'll have to discuss that with my Minister of Finance.
Go ahead.
You swine!
You worm!
Well, a gal a day is enough for me. I couldn't handle any more.
That's what I get for dressing in a hurry.
That's all right.  I'll fix you right up.
WHAT  ?
Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- What was that?
Mrs. Teasdale -- no matter who rules Freedonia, to me you will always be the first lady of the land.
With Mrs. Teasdale as my wife and Freedonia under my control --
I thought everything was working out fine.
Perhaps he will listen to you...
How lovely.
Yes, very well, I think. Are the girls in bed?
No, I think a whiskey.
I shouldn't be. We made great progress today. I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. He did rather well, too, but I had to lead him every step of the way. Though frankly, at times I was unsure of who was leading whom.
Well, I wasn't sure whether he was parroting me because that's all he was capable of, or whether he sensed that that's all I wanted to hear, and he was trying to please me.
He is. I mean, I've always thought he was. I think he must be. Is he simple? Or is that just something I've wished upon him to make things simpler for myself?
And here are my mother and father.
Hmmm?
Did you see it?
I'll get my bag.
I'll show you! I'll show you!
I know what you've done to him and he's never going back to that.
Right... Right.
It's quite nutritious, sir.
Well sir, he's quite seriously deformed, and I fear the other patients would find him... rather shocking.
Ah, no sir. I had planned to see them in the morning.
...Yes, Sir.
Speaking is one thing, Treves, but can the man comprehend?
He needn't. I have no desire to cause him any discomfort. Did you make those inquiries we spoke about?
Fine, fine. You know, your dedication to this patient is an inspiring thing, Treves. But you must remember that this is a hospital, and there are many patients here. Patients who can be made well, and you owe them your first consideration. Just don't become so obsessed, old man, that you begin to neglect them.
Do you think they'll go along with us?
No, we don't. Their committees have informed me that they're unwilling to take Mr. Merrick, even if they were supplied with funds. They don't want him.
I am very pleased to meet you.
What a mess.
Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is "like me".
Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits.
You've never been?
It's very difficult to put into a nutshell, but I should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination, where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world, to any time you desire. You may look over the shoulders of kings, unobserved, battle with ruthless tyrants, and marry the beautiful princess, all in the space of a few hours. Onstage you may be whoever you wish to be, do anything you please, and always, always live happily ever after. The theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world, Mr. Merrick. It is lights and music, gaiety and joy. It's... well, it's romance.
I'm very grateful to you, Mrs. Kendal. This is just the thing to help him forget his ordeal. John will be very excited.
Good morning.
Say "Merrick".
Say "Mmmerrick."
Yes, John?
Mr. Treves. Thank you my... friends.
John.... how can you ever forgive me?
Yes, very soon.
Then I shouldn't change anything?
I regret that I must leave you here, m' Lord, m' Lady. Thank you so much for coming. It was an act of the greatest charity.
I can't understand why you let those people go in there, sir.
Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office.
A dressing bag.
Take him? Now wait... I didn't take him anywhere. We were just having some fun. We didn't hurt him... just having a laugh, that's all.
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME! I ain't done nothing wrong. People pay to see your monster, Mr. Treves. I just take the money.
Never mind. I'm the owner.
Ah! It's my father!
Who, Father?
There's nobody here, Father. Look for yourself.
You're losing your temper!
But one day I'll catch you... Like I caught her...
What are what?
PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!
Yes.
No... no...
It was my master Keitel's idea.
I shouldn't have come.
The Gods are asleep, Erik.
That I cannot tell you.
Well, how d'you think I feel?
Yes?
Don't talk nonsense.
Oh! No! No... of course not... it's just I hadn't expected it to be quite so big.
The important thing is not to panic.
Me? Of course! I've been looting and pillaging up and down the coast.
Sh!
What -- rape?
Oh, get it over with.
Well you started it.
Aaagh! Rape!
I didn't mean to!
Come on, move it!
I know. I know.
What's it all about?
She got me thinking...
Row! Row! Row!
Sorry!
Shut up. You there. You there and you there.
ROW!
So?
Just say something cheerful.
What is it?
I don't know -- but I'm not afraid to try.
We haven't got a spare place.
DEATH!
Is THIS Hy-Brasil?
I have to go...
You will wait?
Please.
Do what?
No, it is NOT.
No, I'm not.
How can you help feeling bad when you're sea-sick?
Olaf Tryggvason used to throw up on every single voyage... the whole time... non-stop... puke... puke... puke.
That's it!
I've got you, Keitel Blacksmith. If you go... I go too...
Hang on...
It's me. I'm just going to water the dragon...
But, Keitel, if Erik ever finds the Horn Resounding... if he ever crosses Bi-Frost, the Rainbow Bridge... if he ever wakens the gods..
Honour and protect all blacksmiths.
Well... I... I thought...
Relax!
She knows it was our fault!
You went berserk...
Easy, Dad!
Neither am I.
Erik's right! We'll all meet in Valhalla.
I'm not frightened... of anything...
No, Mother.
I never do...
I hope you feel better, sweetie.
Say hi to Naomi.
I did. You said, things were fine.
But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal ones, y'know? I mean, what kind of people do well at this stuff?
Hi, Joel. So no jokes about my name?
Hi.
I'm excited, too. Oh, and I wanted to give you this. It's a little... thing.
Anyway. Sorry. Hi.
No, I mean, I don't know. I can't really think of much to say probably.
Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit right now.
Exactly! Tom Waits. Which song?
My writing career! Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski.  The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.
I don't know what that means.
I'm not nuts.
See, I wouldn't think that about you.
Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But --
Sort of, um...
Well, I wouldn't want to be --
Never mind. Sorry, that was stupid. I'm embarrassed. Good night, Joel.
Very much.
I miss grade school. I don't know why I'm calling it grade school all of a sudden. When I went we called it elementary school. But I like grade school better. Sounds like something someone from the forties would call it. I'd like to be from then. Everyone wore hats. Anyway, cheers!
I'm fine.
No, I'm okay for now.
You pick it.
Drink up, young man. It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant.
Yeah, I don't know. It's hard to know.
Oh, yeah.
I think so.
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.
It's three.
Where are you going?
No. I want to have a baby. I have to have a baby.
I don't want to talk about this here.
No, it isn't that.
I hired them to. We're in my brain. But I want it to stop, before I wake up and don't know you anymore.
I'm right here.
Really? Is he cute?
Gross! You must remember to tell me this in the morning. I'm, like, so freaked out now.
This kid, Joe Early, is going to beat the shit out of me.
I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure.
I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that. I mean, I don't mean I'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm such a loser. Every time I come to a party I tell myself I'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after for being such a clod.
Did this conversation come before or after we saw the house?
Yeah, yeah. It goes "Perhaps there is someone in this world to whom I could send all these lines"?
Oh.
What are you doing?
That's what it says. You drank too much, you picked on me for being passive and timid.
I know. I spoke to my friend Magda.
Hey, lover. Whatcha doing?
Long day thinking.
I'm like a joke to them.
Maybe if I just explain what happened, I wouldn't have to go through this and I could tell you everything and it would be like you knew and we could rebuild and we could be happy again and...
Oh, God. I miss her. I can't believe she's with that guy now! I'm never going to see her again. I love her so much. What a fucking monster she is!
I wasn't going to call her. Not after the way she was.
This is it. The night we met. My God, it's over.
Is there any sort of risk of brain damage?
Well... I did.
I'm trapped in my head and everything I love is being erased! Stop it now!
I don't know, I've just been thinking, maybe we're not happy with each other.
In a minute.
It's been a pretty lonely couple of years.
We'll speak soon.
Yeah. Cool.
I know. Anyway --
You found us okay?
That's a good one.
It's a good one all right.
What?
This guy's only half cooked. There's no time to fuck around, Stan.
Thanks, Stan.
Yes?
Okay. Good. Great. Thanks.  I like you, Howard... an awful lot. Is that terrible?
I have a family, Mary.
I didn't make you. You thought it best.  But, look, I take full responsibility.
I was away from the monitor for a second. I had it on automatic. I had to go pee.
1062 Sherman Drive. Apartment 1E, Rockville Center.
December 15th, 2004. I met someone tonight. Oh, Christ: I don't know what to do. Her name is Clementine and she's amazing. So alive and spontaneous and passionate and sensitive. Things with Naomi and I have been stagnant for so long.
Thanks, Stan. Thanks.
I don't know what you're talking about, Howard.
Then check the connections.
Yeah.
Just wanted to let you know.
This one's history. Moving on...
She was unconscious, Patrick.
Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.
It's a quote book.
Easy come, easy go.
I don't.
Cowgirls exist as an image. A fairly common image. The idea of cowgirls especially for little girls prevails in our culture. Therefore, it seems to me, the existence of cowgirls should prevail. Otherwise, they're being fooled. In the Rodeo Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City there are just two cowgirls. Two. And both of 'em are trick-riders. Trick-riding is what cowgirls have almost always done in rodeos. Our society sure likes to see its unconventional women do tricks. That's what prostitutes call it, you know: 'tricking.'
'Drugged' is a stupid word.
If I flinch when you say you love me, it's both our problems. My confusion becomes your confusion. Students confuse teachers, patients confuse psychiatrists, lovers with confused hearts confuse lovers with clear hearts....
If we Ivy Leaguers aren't earthy enough to suit you hillbillies, at least we don't go around indulging in racist terms such as 'Chink.' Next thing I know, you'll be calling me 'chief.'
Your ranch?
A job for me?
Shit O dear, that's enough to make me asthmatic. The nerve of those twits. What do they know about female odor? Don't interrupt. Here's my concept. My ranch out West? It's a beauty ranch. Oh, it's got a few head of cattle for atmosphere and tax purposes. But it's a beauty ranch, a place where unhappy women -- divorcees and widows, mainly -- can go to lose weight, remove wrinkles, change their hair styles and pretty themselves up for the next disappointment. My ranch is named the Rubber Rose, after the Rubber Rose douche bag, my own invention, and bless its little red bladder, the most popular douche bag in the world. So get this. It's on the migratory flight path of the whooping cranes. The last flock of wild whooping cranes left in existence. Well, these cranes stop off at my little pond -- Siwash Lake, it's called -- twice a year, autumn and spring, and spend a few days each time, resting up, eating, doing whatever whooping cranes do. I've never seen them, understand, but I hear they're magnificent. Very big specimens -- I mean, huge mothers -- and white as snow, to coin a phrase, except for black tips on their wings and tail feathers, and bright red heads. Now, whooping cranes, in case you didn't know it, are noted for their mating dance. It's just the wildest show in nature. It's probably the reason why birdwatching used to be so popular with old maids and deacons. Picture these rare, beautiful, gigantic birds in full dance -- leaping six feet off the mud, arching their backs, flapping their wings, strutting low to the ground. Dears, it's overwhelming. And picture the birds doing their sex dance on TV. Right there on the home screen, creation's most elaborate sex ritual -- yet clean and pure enough to suit the Pope. With lovely Sissy Hankshaw in the foreground. In a white gown, red hood attached, and big feathery sleeves trimmed in black. In a very subdued imitation of the female whooping crane, she dance/walks over to a large nest in which there sits a can of Yoni Yum. And a can of Dew. Off-camera, a string quartet is playing Debussy. A sensuous voice is reading a few poetic lines about courtship and love. Are you starting to get it? Doesn't it make the hair on your neck stand up and applaud? My very goodness gracious! Grandiose, lyrical, erotic and Girl Scout- oriented; you can't top it. I've hired a crew of experts from Walt Disney Studios, the best wildlife cinematographers around. You're my eternal favorite. Princess Grace herself couldn't be better, not even if she had your personality which she doesn't; Anyway, dear, I'm out of photography now and into water colors. Ah how circuitous conversation is! We're back at the beginning. The exact man I've wanted you to meet is my artist the watercolorist.
Now, now. Don't get exasperated. I realize that you've always avoided all but the most rudimentary involvements with men, and I might add, you've been wise. Heterosexual relationships seem to lead only to marriage. For men, marriage is a matter of efficient logistics: The male gets his food, bed, laundry, TV, pussy, offspring and creature comforts all under one roof, where he doesn't have to dissipate his psychic energy thinking about them too much, then he is free to go out and fight the battles of life, which is what existence is all about. But for a woman marriage is surrender.
Why, yes, technically. Jack Kerouac and I came awfully close, but he was afraid of me, I think...
I don't know anything about it.
Uh, yeah Coop, I'm still here.
I'm in the Second Containment area. It's pitch black in here. There must have been a coolant leak. Man, this shit is everywhere. I can't see a damn thing.
You prep the gravity couches. I'm going to manually arm those explosives.
It worked for Weir. Prep the tanks.
What?
No, thank you.
No, he didn't.
I'm telling you, I saw it...
Trauma.
His vitals are stable, but he's unresponsive to stimuli. He might wake up in fifteen minutes. He might not wake up at all.
"Another man?" Who?
He's crashing...
Starck!
We still have pressure. The radiation count's steady at 7 millirads an hour.
Someone sent that message. Admiral, you have to put me on that ship.
I can use the station in Medical, keep an eye on Justin...
Justin.
The clock is running, Dr. Weir. If you'll follow the rest of the crew, they'll show you to the gravity tanks.
Until then, do what you're told and stay out of my way.
Captain, I didn't come out here to sit on your bridge, I need to be on that ship...
It's complicated...
"Insane?" The finest astronauts fought to be posted to this ship. It would take the Lewis and Clark a thousand years to reach our closest star. The Event Horizon could be there in a day...
The Event Horizon's computer think's it's 2034.
The Core...!
What do you want me to say?
Don't... don't do this...
Son of a bitch!
What makes you think I'll miss?
You know.
Locked and cocked.
Starck, give me a read.
Smith, where the hell have you been?!
We don't have time to fart.
No one's dying on my watch, Smith! What about the reserve tanks?
That's enough!
Get outside, go back to work. I'll join you shortly.
We can take the filters from the Clark...
Dr. Weir, you were right there, you must have heard something, seen something...
Starck, do you know how crazy that sounds? It's impossible.
He's awake, he's in the airlock, he's not wearing a suit.
Blow it up?
DJ!  It's okay. You're okay. Just breathe.
There's no one here.
I did.
Say this paper represents space-time, and you want to get from "point A" here...  ...to "point B," here.  Now: what's the shortest distance between two points?
She's not ugly.
Shit, Doc, any closer and we're gonna need a rubber...
That's the Core: the gravity drive. The heart of the ship.
It still has air and reserve power, we can activate gravity and life support.
Matching speed... now. Range to target ten thousand meters and closing... Skipper, I got a bad feeling about this...
1000 meters...
Picking up magnetic interference.
How?
Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
I'm blind, not deaf. Wanna come in?
Well why didn't you say so? You want me to lift some weights or something?
It's not him. It's them.  I can't live like this.
I'm worried about you.
This wasn't our first stop, in case you forgot NASA. And Victor's not that bad. He's just a little...  Larger than life.
Ben. This is business. Just work.
Victor's better at these things.
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
This isn't permanent, Johnny. We need to be careful until we're normal again.
Yeah. I can tell. Victor was right.
Back on Earth. Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
Give me the god damn mirror!
Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.  Clear the way, wide load coming through.
Gotcha. Okay. Supernova bad.
But all these people...
Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
Dude. That's my sister.
Yes sir. You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
Right. That's exactly what I meant.
I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a massive amount of evidence before making that leap.
We need to get past them.
What about you? You haven't eaten in days. How come you're never on this side of the microscope?
I think it was a little more complicated than --
Of course. Of course.
No way to know. Without more tests, experiments.
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
I'm sure I can come up with something.
Hilarious.
Reed, we're running out of time.
Not much. We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage.
I ruined? With all due respect, I told you to abort --
What I should have done a long time ago. Applications and patents, Reed. This all belongs to me.
Which is precisely the point. Analysis is over. It's time for action. My men could have mass-produced this by now.
Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
Raising the shields.
Just find him.
Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he likes having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic, isn't it? You're finally the perfect woman for him... because you're his science project.
I know it can't be easy. Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny. At least they can go out in public. But for you? People staring. Whispering behind your back...
I'm just saying, I know what it's like to lose something you love. To see it slip away, and know it's never coming back.
Don't worry about it.
Brad. I don't want to have to use sex as a tool.
Totally.
It's the first door on your left!
Don't worry about it. Who sent the flowers?
Are you kidding? Work is great. I kill at work. I don't even mind Mom and Dad making me pay rent.
Where did you hear that?
Brad. Please don't tell Mom and Dad...
No.
Okay, Dennis.
He insulted me first. He called me a moron.
Come on...
He's my friend, too.
I think I came. Didn't you feel it?
Mike, there's something that's been on my mind and I have to tell you about it.
I know it's yours.
It's already planned, Mike. It's going to cost $150 at the Free Clinic.
What do you mean -- wuss? This girl is my exact type. It's her. Definitely her.
No.
No. It's too soon.
Really?
You tell me, Mike. What do I do?
I think I've got it. Once I get going, I'll be okay. But... how do I get started? I mean, I hardly know her.
No. It's too late. The food is coming and everything. Damone, I've got to ask you this favor, and I'll never ask you for anything again in this lifetime or any other. Will you please borrow your mom's car, go by my house, get my wallet, and meet me back here?
I'm really pretty busy...
Wow. I've been looking for that thing! Hey, Damone, have you met Stacy Hamilton? Stacy, this is Mike Damone.
No Damone. I don't understand.
And they don't call my parents?
Outrageous, Merv. Nice to be here. I feel great.
I wanted to talk a little bit about school, if I could...
You know the thing I love about Mustangs? The steering wheel.
What should I do?
He was hot, wasn't he?
Believe it.
Oh! That's where that group got its name from.
Not since November.
You really ought to look at this, Linda. There's a drawing on every page... and all these quizzes. It's like school.
Climax together.
He works for the airline. He'll be out here. You'll meet him.
I think they're both virgins.
It could be. I had a pregnancy test at the clinic. I'll find out Monday. I guess it was Damone.
That little prick.
He says he's got to stay in Chicago.  He says I should visit him sometimes.
Well I might go to Dartmouth.
There's a world of guys out there. I just wish I didn't have to date any of them.
That's the name they gave me.
You mean, you couldn't? Or you wouldn't?
Food will be eaten on your time!  Why are you continuously late for this class, Mr. Spicoli? Why do you shamelessly waste my time like this?
Hey, it's in my locker, Mr. Hand.
No problem.
Yes... I am really nineteen.
I'll have one more Coke... Do you want another Coke, Stacy?
Of course. But if I were you, I'd leave the Doctor alone until after he's eaten breakfast. He's a very crude man.
Look, you want to be gentle with that woman if she ever calls again. We're watching her very carefully... this woman has been into laudanum. It's a controlled experiment, but I suspect we'll need your cooperation before this thing is over.
Naked.
WHAT?
Naw! Not a major.
You're going to need to take the bull by the horns -- go to the mat with this scum.
Hell, no!
We will. You Samoans are all the same. You have no faith in the essential decency of the white man's culture.
And eat them! That bastard won't get away with this! What's going on in this country when a scum sucker like that can get away with sandbagging a Doctor of Journalism?
God didn't do that! You did it! You're a fucking narcotics agent, that was our cocaine, you pig!
You whore!
But what about our room? And the golf shoes?
No, no. Don't leave me!
To do the job, of course. Here we go... a Crab Louie and quart of muscatel for twenty dollars!
Nonsense. We came here to find the American Dream, and now we're right in the vortex you want to quit. You must realize that we've found the Main Nerve.
GO?
That depends on how many people we fuck with between here and the door.
Probably the bartender. He wanted to stomp you for what you said to the waitress.
You drive! I think there's something wrong with me.
That little blonde groupie with the film crew? You think he sodomized her?
Don't touch it! Get back in that tub!
Why worry? You'll like it. Nothing in the world like a Mace high. Forty- five minutes on your knees with the dry heaves...
There's no choice. I wouldn't dare go to sleep with you wandering around with a head full of acid and wanting to slice me up with that goddamn knife!
What are you doing in Baker? Didn't you get my telegram?
It can't be helped. This is Lucy.  You know -- like "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds."
I figure she can do about four at a time. Christ, if we keep her full of acid that's more like two grand a day. Maybe three.
You'll go straight to the gas chamber. And even if you manage to beat that, they'll send you back to Nevada for Rape and Consentual Sodomy. She's got to go.
We have to cut her loose. She's got two hundred dollars. And we can always call the cops up there in Montana, where she lives, and turn her in.
Maybe we should take it easy tonight.
They're actually nice people when you get to know them.
Man, you don't know trouble until you have to face down a bunch of these addicts gone crazy for human sacrifice!
...and every one of them stacked naked...
We keep it quiet. It's not the kind of thing you'd want to talk about upstairs. Not with the press around.
Inspector Rock will pay you. In cash. A thousand dollars on the ninth of every month.
Yeh... This foreign made crap -- is sucking our dollar balance dry!
Of course, officer.
Yes! I'll help you all you need! I hate dope!
Whatever you say, gentlemen. I can't tell you how sorry I am about what happened...
Don't be stupid, drop the gun!
He's right, let's move. Be quiet and get to the exit. Pair up, grab the weapons.
They'll be back.
Um, yeah, thirty miles east.
With what just happened upstairs --
Gonna stay for a couple?
If we move in a group, we are one target. If we scatter, they CAN'T get us all.
And the rest of 'em?
Hey!
There's a tunnel.
What?
Just an observation.
You weren't helpin'.
Oh yeah?
He's dead.
My truck.
We lived near power lines.
Anyone else?
What?
But not flush against the tunnel?
Well...
It'll calm your nerves. Works like a charm.
Okay then.
Uh huh, now wiggle that sweet little ass over here and sit on Daddy's face, I wanna do some appraising.
Easy. We're surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before. Some kind of animals. Real fast, volatile, predators. ONE went through three of your patrons like they were Kleenex.
Seven.
Seven.
What are you gonna do? Throw your teeth at 'em? Sit down, Cocoon.
Clear!
Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?
If he doesn't shut up...
HELLLPPP!
I'm done drinking. That's it. Just Church and grocery stores. Nothin' else.
Nothing, just lookin'.
Whoa!
Wait God-dammit!
GO-GO-GO!!
We all have to be strong, right?
Well...
So not only am I a troublesome bitch, but I'm fat too?
'Forgive'...? For What?
That's not the point. Frances Farmer has the world by the tit because of this studio, and now she thinks she can waltz off without a thank you. No. No, that young lady has a contract, and she's going to honor it.
Okay. Good tits. Can't we show them off a little more?
You see: We've got to change that name.
But I'm the one up there on the screen.
It's a perfectly good car. It runs.
Uh-huh. You mean what if the public finds out I perspire? And wear slacks. And drive an old jalopy? What if they find out I'm a real person. Oh no! Say it ain't so! Not a real person!
Oh well. I guess I better leave then.
I hear you're meeting with the studio lawyers to get out of your contract.
Well... well, you see, that's the point. You won't be opening in London.
In my eyes, officer.
You have no right! You have no fucking right, you bastards! Get the hell out of here --
Dick, I can't even breathe here...
No?
The hearing's tomorrow. If she gets out legally, they can't come after her.
I know you believe that.
I'm afraid not. You see, we observe things that you're unaware of: signs, indicators. Your problem cuts very deep, Frances, and we have to get at that deeper stuff so that when you do get out, you'll really feel secure. Does that make sense?
We'll get you home, Frances.
Thank you, Frances. And after the show we're hosting a reception for you and your friends at Hollywood's own Roosevelt Hotel!
He's a socialist, then?
Francie, you'll learn that sometimes it's best to stay low and just walk away.
...Then go.
Why? It's such a simple thing. You just let me out and I disappear down a road and you never have to see me again.
But I gave her my word. Besides, she's still your legal guardian. My hands are tied.
I can thank you for that. It was a hard-earned talent.
I don't believe this! You jerks drag me down here in the middle of the night and you don't even know who the hell I am!
Fifteen.
I wouldn't miss it.
I'm telling you straight, if you have any serious ambitions, stay clear of the place. It'll crush you.
Harry York. I work for Martoni Kaminski, he's running for Congress here.
Yeah, well --
Well... see the papers've got us pegged as pinkos, then you come along, the friendly neighborhood atheist --
I just wanted to see how you looked.
I always told ya, Frances. You got real ability.
The hell you will, Harry York.
I took the early rounds.
And?
Who said I was a lady?
Hey! Another shot for the lady and a double for me!
Hey, you're a good quarter-horse, kid, but you can't go a route of ground.
What's that?
Thanks, Harry, really, but... I can't explain it. She's my mother. She's just... I can't give up on her that easy.
I know, but... There were so many people in there, Harry. Every time I turned around someone was pressing against me... watching, looking over my shoulder, touching me, grabbing, sticking things into me. When I feel somebody near me now... anybody... my skin starts to crawl.
Yes. Would you like me to walk a little way with you?
Wherever they're going, I'm going.
Who's writing this guy's lines?
No, I couldn't get my hands on one.
I know, but I'm not seeing it. It's there, Frances, the fire is there, but it's not coming through. You're lazy --
I already have.
Smile, little sister, smile.
Why are these all opened?
Please. I want you to. It would make me so happy.
Where are you going?
I promise I'll... I promise, Mama.
Mama...?
No, Mama, I'll take care of it. I'll wash them in the morning.
Don't I know you?
Oh bullshit.
Am I supposed to say 'thank you'?
It ain't for lack of trying.
Why, Doctor! We've only just met!
All right. Will you please sit down now?  Symington says.
Stay calm, please.
You didn't say 'Symington says'.
What?
What is that to you? Evil as you are.
I'm... very, very ugly. People are afraid. Except you.
Yes. Very close
You speak.
How dare you. You're disgusting and evil.
There was something at work in my soul which I do not understand.
Materials. Nothing more.
I don't know.
I do know that for the sympathy of one living being, I would make peace with all.  I have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine. And rage the likes of which you would not believe. If I cannot satisfy the one, I will demonically indulge the other. That choice is yours.  You're the one who set this in motion, Frankenstein.
We'd travel north, my bride and I. To the furthest reaches of the Pole, where no man has ever set foot. There we would live out our lives. Together.  No human eye would ever see us again. This I vow.
Her body pleases me.
She's not for you.
SHE'LL NEVER BE YOURS! SHE SAID MY NAME! SHE REMEMBERS!
Quite right!
He was almost expelled for calling one of his professors a "pompous...  Fellow..."
Read him one of the old letters and rephrase it. We'll say it came today. It'll set his mind at ease.
Fine.
Is he not back yet?
She was mother to me as well. But ours is the job of the living. It's up to us now to hold this family together. We must think of Father and be strong for him.  I cannot do that alone.
The world is a dizzying place.
Only you.
Not as weak as I.
...until our wedding night. When our bodies will join.
It wouldn't dare.
You're saying all disease will eventually be eradicated?
Victor, Victor Frankenstein.
You're a comfort to me, Henry.
It's a letter to my father.
These are exciting times, Henry. We're entering an era of amazing breakthroughs. Look at Edward Jenner. He wasn't content to bleed people with leeches, he pioneered a new frontier of thought
Somebody has to!
I resent God's monopoly.
Blasphemy be damned! Waldman spent his life trying to help people!
No. He had more important work.
A... week?
No. They don't.
Let it go.
And is it true, Miss Moritz, that you love Victor Frankenstein? That your heart was broken?  Answer the question. Do you love Victor Frankenstein?
Or Albertus Magnus. Cornelius Agrippa...
Despite the lack of challenge.
I once saw it done, as a boy in Canton. My parents were missionaries. The cure was nothing short of miraculous.  I've never forgotten it. Been fascinated ever since.
I doubt that decision is still mine to make.
Why?
I can't say I blame them. We're trapped in this ice and bedeviled by some sort of... creature.
It will be all right. I'll take care of you.
No, no, they're all dead...
Sure.
It's over twenty miles to the crossroads. Steve'll be back in an hour. Things will straighten out then. We'll take his Jeep and get help.
Some campers drowned. Then some counselors got killed.
I meant everything.
I can't, Barry...
Here we go.
I figured if I didn't save you. I'd have to give you mouth-to-mouth and that would have ruined my appetite.
Where's Ned?
I don't believe you...
Whatever you make yourself.
I was just wondering if you thought there'd by any other gorgeous women at Camp Crystal Lake. Besides yourself.
Ned!
I thought you wanted to give him one of your motherly lectures. Ned is gonna do whatever he wants to do, you know.
Lead the way!
There you are dead wrong.
Another coincidence.
Just my son and I.
Vacation. I'm taking him to see his first bullfight.
Stop? We're not going to actually stop at a motel, are we?
I have no idea.
My wife.
Yes, she is.
Auto wreck.
You want me to sit here and be passive. The only way being passive in this situation makes sense is if I believe you'll let us go. I'm not there yet. You have to convince me you're telling the truth.
Yes.
No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking now.
I'm gonna just sit here and drain this bottle. And when I've drunk the last drop, if I still feel then, the way I feel now, I'm gonna take this bottle and break it over his melon head.
What's an official cross? Some piece of tin made in Taiwan? What makes that official? If a cross works against vampires, it's not the cross itself, it's what the cross represents. The cross is a symbol of holiness.
I don't give a shit about living or dying anymore. I just want to send as many of these devils back to hell as I can.
Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!
Daddy's dead.
Not many.
Me too.
Knock yourself out.
Well that don't matter now, 'cause you got about two fuckin' seconds to live! Richie!
This is a private club. You're not welcome.
He signaled the Ranger.
-- This conversation is over.
Sight seein'.
How do you know?
She's in the other room.
As long as you don't act like a fuckin' nut, we'll be just fine.
I did?
Where are you?
Scarred for life, that's how I am!
Thank you, ensign.
Who's "we"?
Just a friend.  We have friends, too, you know.
Your prerogative, Senator.
I'm fine, sir.
I'm not out to change your sex, lieutenant.  You'll have separate beds, separate heads.  If you have specific medical needs, inform the infirmary.  If a classmate or superior acts in an harassing or otherwise unbecoming manner, please inform me immediately so I can deal with it immediately.  Questions?
Then that's all I have to say. Dismissed.
Didn't take long.
It's this double-standard, the separate quarters, the deferential treatment.  It's how you pulled out my chair and nearly served high tea the first time we met.
I think you've resented me from the start, sir.
Across the board, sir.
Sir...
No problem, sir!
Fuck me.
That aside for the moment, I'm struck by the tenor, the ill-spirit of your report... the degrading remarks by other aviators... innuendo about her performance in unrelated situations... even a reference to her sexual activity the weekend prior.  In my seven years on this committee, I've never seen a downed aviator treated like this.  Never.  I'm deeply disturbed by this report, Mr. Hayes.  Not just what it bodes for women in the military -- but for your own confirmation as well.
California.
Sounds familiar.
If I have to ask again, Senator, I'll be asking in front of cameras.
I'm saying it's not going to happen. Not when the President is set to turn this into a third-rail issue should I choose to ever campaign against him.  He will fry me six ways to Sunday for sending daughters and young mothers off to war -- and, quite possibly, for bringing them back in body bags.
'Snot me.  It's him.
Flea!  O'Neil!  Why is there a break in that line?
I oughtta report you.
You'll try what we tell you to try, O'Neil.  Go regulation.
Gotta situation here.  Where are you?  Stuck in traffic?
Royce.  We're the same age, we started the same time -- and now you're sitting in the upperdecks while I'm still down in the bullpen. What does that tell you about the Navy?
Wai', wait.  What happens if it works?  Four months of training, three years of operational duty. What then?
Me?  Why me?
I'm tired of fighting back.  I just wanted to come home and be safe and have you here and the river there and just forget the rest of the world, okay?
You don't crap out of Spec-Recon and get another shot without dispensation from someone up in flag country.  He's got a Sea Daddy somewhere.
Yeah.  Me too.
Thanks, Wick.
Intagliata was out chasing breakfast.  They found his tracks. Well, shit.
He was married?
Let's keep talkin', Wick.  Just keep talkin' to me...
That's okay.  Just an ex-girlfriend. And know I remember why.
Just askin'
I don't know...
I'm lookin', I'm lookin'!
Maybe half.  Not even.
Should I be afraid?
Good to see you again, too, sir.
Shut up, sir.  I'm concentrating.
That your desk?  I'll take this one.
Listen, Sex Ape.  I'm here to stay. And if you don't want me for a roommate or classmate, you got two options -- move out or ring out. End of file.
Sure.  Now she wants to shoot.
Cortez, see if you can dig out the tools without losing the rest of out gear.  Try a wrench on that thing.
FLEA!  KEEP YOUR EYES ON THAT SPOT! Mark it, mark it!  Cortez?  What the hell you waiting for?
Darth Vader reads poetry...
O'Neil, Jordan.
Women.
I don't know.  Seems...
Great. See ya then.
All that "you gotta be vicious" stuff you filled her head with.
Look, you want to make it up to your friend? Well if he's right, this is your chance.
It's the maintenance entrance. Runs along the side of the tunnel. When they repaired it last year I worked on a piece about it.
Yes. Definitely. Definitely enough.
You're crazy, go to the east side and take the park avenue to the JFK.
It's good to see you, Nick.
What?
No, I'm into earthworms now. You wouldn't be interested. They're real "boring" creatures. Very reliable, dependable, no surprises...
So you thought that made it okay to steal my tapes?
I know a way. I know how you can get a message out of here.
How do you know?
Your station won't have any easier time contacting the military than I did.
Really? I'd like to find out.
Speak of the devil.
This is not the place...
Not anymore. Mr. Caiman, I quit.
That is when we will go in.
Christ. How many tunnels lead off the island?
They are with me!
Get your people out of there or I will.
We know.
No, but I have the feeling I'm about to find out.
Thanks.
Oh.
I am not permitted to speak of such things.
Makes us look more American.
Good idea.
I can't get through. I don't know what's wrong.
I'm... I'm shot.
... It has been my greatest honor to serve with you.  LIving by your example these years, my life has had meaning.  I have been blessed.  Sir, I... I...
You'll forgive my impertinence, sir, but even though we had never before met, always considered you as a father to me.
Like throwing gasoline on a fire...
We stop we die. Keep holding the thruster down Tommy!
Nothing.
... . Well  you have to figure out what it wants... What's its motivation?
That's your problem.  You were never serious about the caraft...  "I'm a rock... I just want to be a rock... Still. Peaceful.. Tranquil.." ..."Oh, but what's this?  Something's making noise... No, not noise, no... MOVEMENT.  VIBRATIONS.  Make the vibrations stop, they go straight into me like a knife!... I must CRUSH the thing that makes the vibrations..."
No time to worry about that, Alex. Tommy, let's get this thing slowed down... Gwen, see if you can calculate the impact point. Guy, cet down to deck C and make sure tne injured are secured. Also lets-
I played Richard III...
Oh can't I? Watch me!
Shit! I'm doing it! I'm repeating the damn computer!
Alex? Where are you going?
It doesn't make sense... Surely they could have fortified the compound against those creatures...
What?
No I didn't.
We'd better get everybody online.  And Kyle, Stop downloading porn.  Your frame rate is unacceptable.
We accidently traded Vox units when we bumped into each other on Saturday.
What's  your name, son?
It's real, Brandon. All of it, It's real.
GO Commander.
We need another one.
All systems are working, Commander. ,~ -cc	PINK) -' C -
What does that mean?!!!  Yes, I see! Yes... It means that perhaps... the... bonding molecules have become covalent?!...
So our solution is to introduce a bonding substrate! - A two molecule compound sharing a free electron - and bombard the ions with their reflective isotopes!
I...Well, uh... Yes, absolutely.
Hopkins can't drink your bathwater Fred.
It's ... incredible.
Let's get out of here before one of those things kills guy.
We're doing episode 31, Jason?
All right, let's all settle down.  If we're going to get through this we're going to have to exercise self control.
Jason, are we doing Episode 31 or not?
Mathesar, maybe we should get some of your crew up here.
Did it ever occur to you that if you had been a little more supportive you could have held on to me?
Will you stop RIDING ME?!
Yes. Yes, I'm here!
What the hell are you talking about?
Wait... Jason, Here!...
Because it was on the show!
This is great!  They're going to start eating each other out there.
You are so full of shit
I have ONE job on this lousy ship. It's stupid, but I'm going to DO it. GOT IT?
Closer?  I can try.
Okey dokey, let's fire blue particle cannons full. Fire red particle cannons full. Fire gannet magnets left and right. Fire pulse catapults from all chutes. And throw this thing at him too, killer.
Better than my Lieutenant.  He failed to activate ship's neutron armor as quickly as I'd hoped on our last encounter.
Deliver the device now or I will destroy your ship.
Gwen. The show. There's no choice. Do it.
Our dimwitted friends don't understand the concept of acting. They have no theater, no imagination these scientists.
Right, If this is about the thing tomorrow you can hammer out the details with my agent, but make sure I have a limo from my house, they jammed me into a Toyota the last time I did one of these
Oh, right! The thing with the thing. Come on in, I'll get some pants on.
It was a lot of fun. You kids are great.
Well... Sort of...
But...Why?
Wh... Where are we?
They designed the ship from watching you. So... Take her out, Lieutenant...
Good work, Tommy.  Let's go!
How about the pig-lizard?
Commander?... Call me Laredo?
They always say that.
Congress has been using our supply wagons for years to ship their black market goods -- probably their whores!
And a French alliance?
The man's waiting for you to get wiped off the stage so he can become commander and chief.
Christ, George, Joseph Reed's been writing letters back to Congress attacking you.  Your own aide!
That can't be.
Gates?  He used my battle plan and I humbly submit that without me he'd still be back at Saratoga waiting for the British to attack.  George, why haven't you moved into the Potts' house back at the creek? Much more befitting of a Commander and Chief than your field tent. And... you could entertain.  I think you need to entertain more. Seriously!  Get a few New Jersey whores up here, invite some Congressmen... couldn't hurt.
Cut those men down.  Congress is pushing ahead with your court-martial.  Benedict, trust me to handle this.
None of the servants is to touch a gun!  You know that!
A lot of years have gone by.
Yes, William.  I am apologizing.
No, my lord.
Because they have hardly any uniforms, they designate officers with colored ribbons.  My lord.
Hamilton, you're going to have to cover our asses as we cross.
Well, sir, then is it possible you called us all here just to hear what you wanted to hear.
With pleasure... and an honor.  Did you hear about Nathan Hale?
But it's what he said, just before they killed him:  "I regret that I have but one life to give to my country."
Yes, I believe so.
As does your ability, Horatio.  We must talk further, when it's more convenient.
Gag on your own invention, then.
Finally!?  It's people like these who, as soon as they get a little power, want more and more.  More ale, here!
If he isn't, then he's stupid.
These men have suffered but I believe they will fight.
What can he do?  The British have massive superiority.
To assert the rights of our founding fathers!  This country was colonized by Christians!  This shall become a Christian revolution.  Surely as a good Christian you understand that!
I mean, I'm a Deist.  A belief I share with the likes of Tom Jefferson and Ben Franklin.  Surely you knew that.
They are also very religious.  So, we will attack them three days from now, on Christmas.  One force under me, and another to the south under Colonel Cadwalader...
How many generals do we have like Arnold?  He's got guts -- he's vain, and he fights!
When the snow melts, mon petite Marquis, I suspect the only thing blossoming will be bright red British soldiers.
Don't be ridiculous, of course that won't happen.
What else?  From Virginia?
You wrong me, general; I am an officer and a horse-shoer.
You have a free tongue, Captain Hamilton.
They're for my bodyguard.  I have an absolute conviction that Arnold is planning to have me assassinated!  It will be harder if I am surrounded by a body of men who look like me, don't you think?
I remember a pair of young philosophers once, who laughed at the world.
Except for that, quite like home; England, that is.
Words, words, words!  Sally has been tutoring George in the philosophies, isn't that right?
That's just my interpretation. Actually it's a dance designed as a sentiment of courtly manners. You see?  Walk in a gently 'Z'. There are four distinct movements...
What else should I become?  There's no difference between Virginia and England.  I must be educated if I'm to take my place in society.  My father couldn't afford to send me to England for school -- he made a shambles of our fortunes.  Everyone laughs at me.
I think I will disappoint you.
That?  I hear a mob:  unemployed, drunkards, vagabonds... the world's dregs.
Yeah, well, this one's the Cadillac of minivans.
Hey, you want La Tierra Rent-A-Car just over there, but I think all they got are Rabbit convertibles.
Mr. Lovejoy? That's cute, Bo.
Her mother. Not that it matters because I don't work for you no more. I quit. I just wanted to come by, tell you to your face so there's no misunderstanding.
Remember Harry's story about the dry cleaner Palmer was after? Guy who stole the three hundred grand from the airline?
Don't fade on me now, Bear. Not unless you wanna hold Farrah on your lap in a room fulla felons.
No shit? What're some of 'em?
Sure. Family. I know how that goes.
Well, I don't know. I gave the man his money, sent him on his way.
Because there were a zillion DEA guys hanging around the terminal.
I hear he's around Palm Springs. Dealing our product. Product we sold to you for five hundred thousand dollars.  Why do you keep talking to me bullshit? I think maybe I have Ramon and Ceasar staple your tongue to your chin. What do you think?
I put a gun right here...  ...and I tell him, 'Sign the paper Marty or your fuckin' dead.' Like that.
Yeah, Morgan Freeman. But he's a colored guy.
What about her?
With Ilona? You know how old Ilona is?
First you and me gotta get a couple things straight.
It was Rio Bravo. Robert Mitchum was the drunk in El Dorado, Dean Martin in Rio Bravo, practically the same part. John Wayne, he also did the same thing in both. He played John Wayne.
I can't do it.
Chili Palmer showed you my script?
Whenever you want it. The money's in hundred dollar bills inside one of those jock bags, you know? In a locker at the airport, waiting to be picked up.
What three hundred grand?
Ray. Look at me.
I told them I was you. I acted stupid and they believed me.
He owes me money.
I don't like waiting.
Hey, fuckball, I don't need your permission. L.A.'s an open city.
Whatta you got there... some kinda pop nine, the fuckin' Fiat of guns, always jammin' at the wrong time.
That's right.
That's what I'd do.  Make sure I got the right guy next time.
We just did. I told you my name's Chili Palmer.
Wait a minute, you're not the guy, are you? The dry cleaner?
Who's the star?
She's a rock star. Every day, same time, they come down here and have breakfast. He has the egg white omelet; she has the banana pancakes. He sits facing west so he can see his billboard. She faces east so she has an excuse to wear the shades.
He drown?
I said I'd think about it. What does that mean? In this town, nothing.
I mean, at least Bo's invested in three of my movies.
Don't waste your time, Harry. The guy's not much of a movie fan. Now c'mon, gimme the key.
Personally?
What Get Away jet?
Yeah, well, maybe the guy took out flight insurance. Check with the wife.
'E.g.' means 'for example', Ray. I think what you wanna say is 'i.e.'
Ask your man here.
It's more like your attitude. Your tone, your speech patterns demonstrate a certain confidence in yourselves, in your opinions, your indifference to conventional views.
Martin, look at me.
Wait. How about this?
Good-looking, too.  Like Karen.
I didn't know where else to keep it.  Where would you?
They report it to the IRS.
That's right. Three percent.
Yeah. When you turn to the camera to tell the alien mother that her time on earth is finished... when you give us all that look, Joan Crawford wishes on her best day she had that much presence. Not even in "Mildred Pierce" - which by the way was a better book than a movie - did Crawford even touch the intensity you had in that look.
Man, can you scream.
I don't like the title. Or the main guy's name.
I want to know.
You were supposed to wait for me with Harry at the restaurant.
Because a movie star can never order straight from the menu. They have to think of something they have to have that isn't on the menu.
Yeah, Harry, you look like you belong in one of your horror movies.
I was scared then, not now. How long you want me to be scared?
Don't worry about it. I won't say any more than I have to, if that.
You said don't say nothing and I didn't.
Harry Zimm. You look like a wet kiss.
Harry -
Yeah, that's what we need. More agents.
Oh, yeah, sure.
Hello, Martin.
Yeah, Karen knows him.
I'm intrigued, yeah. You know what might help you, take a look at the Cylone again, the way a visual fabric is maintained even while the metaphor plays on different levels. Hey -  This your ride, Chili?
A passenger liner. Over.
Roger, Arctic Warrior. I say again, our records indicate the passenger vessel Chimera was lost at sea. Over.
Roger that, North Island. Arctic Warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo four zero niner two. Over and out.
Yeah, a ship that's supposed to have been lost at sea fifty years ago. You don't think that's just a little freaky?
Take it easy, Dodge. It's only a piece of metal.
Morning, skipper.
It's a beautiful country. Very clean. Very civilized. And cold.
Roger?
No.
Or uninvited guests.
I tell you one thing, we're not gonna be towing no ship now.
Oh yeah.
What?
The damn thing's been floating around for God knows how long and it hasn't hit anything yet. So we take it easy. A little of the old push pull.
What is it?
How about you Epps?
Yeah, yeah.
Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam for fifty years. We found her. She's ours.
We'll stand a watch. Four on, eight off. Low man first.
Fresh ain't the first word that comes to mind.
So whoever did this might still be around.
I don't know what you're talking about?
Maybe you can tell me then.
You smashed it!
Conveniently enough for you.
Turbine chamber on number two must've blown! Took out part of the hull!
There's a charming thought.
Right.
He'd let you off at the nearest port, that's for sure.
Maybe six feet. Lanky. I didn't get a good look. He was far away. But I saw him. I saw him as sure as you're standing there.
You're a pal.
Because of the gold.
No.
Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard something is all.
I didn't sign up to go home empty handed. And I sure ain't gonna roll over for the freaky motherfucker did this.
Her destination was Halifax, yeah.
Maybe. But there's always somebody whose interest's at stake.
For now the best thing we can do is to keep quiet about this.
Did you see him?
Yup.
Epps.
But, who -- ?
Epps, over.
Go.
Of course they did.
He'll sell the scrap for three times what he paid.
So we cut her loose and wait it out. A little weather couldn't be anything she hasn't seen before.
Moving to Sweden.
Would you hold on just a minute here, please? Look, there's no reason to panic now. Epps saw somebody. Fine. It's a big boat.  Chances're real good he doesn't even know about the gold. If we stay cool, nobody'll be the wiser.  The gold stays where it is til we're ready to go. Like I said, it'll be a hell of a lot safer there than here.
Lost my sea legs.
You don't remember?
You've been out for about a day.
Shut up.
A what?
Fine with me.
It's tough to find a good job without any kind of training.
How should I know?
YES.
Nothing.
I've got some important news to tell you, but it can wait till later if you're not feeling...
Well... as you know, Maxine and I have been seeing a lot of each other, and we decided it might be a good idea for all of us if she came back here to live at the end of the Summer, just so we can all get to know each other and to make sure this is what we want.
She understands what you're going through and she really wants to help you. She says that job at Computer Station is still available if you want it.
I uh... I feel that I need to uh -- there's something I feel I have to say... I uh, I've never said this to anyone before -- believe me, I've stayed in horrible relationships for years just so I wouldn't have to do this, but I uh...
Please tell me it isn't that teenager!
Well, I got the idea when I was doing some research and I discovered that Cook's Chicken used to be called Coon's Chicken, and so I decided to do my project based on this discovery as kind of a comment on racism... and the way racism is whitewashed over in our culture...
I'm not sure... I mean...  I guess because when we see something like this it seems really shocking and we have to figure out why it's so shocking?
But I was only trying to be friendly...
What? I'm just kidding around with the customers... It's my shtick!
But I feel weird... it's so sleazy.
Look, I already told you I'm not going to give you a ride.
No.
Oh my God, that's HIM!
Can I come in?
I guess.
That's just the way I am!
Why do you have that stupid poster?
I don't think we should... Look, you have to totally promise me you won't tell Becky about this.
Because if you do, I'll kill you!
I thought Chipmunk-face was never going to shut up.
I know, she needs to die immediately.
Good.
Yeah, I just picked the one that sounded the easiest.
In fact, never.
You know, sacrifice virgins and stuff...
Or maybe not.
You loser!
I dunno. John Ellis always puts on all this sick stuff that I have to fast-forward past to get to the good stuff.  There's supposed to be a Don Knotts movie on here someplace.
What exactly is a cardigan anyway?
I can't believe it!
We should follow him home.
He won't see us... we'll just stalk him from a distance.
Ew, it's like some gross rat...
I dunno... I kind of like him... He's the exact opposite of everything I really hate... In a way he's such a clueless dork that he's almost cool...
What, is she black now?
JOSH!
I wonder if I hang around with you because you're like my surrogate mother figure or something. Like I have this subconscious biological need to be nagged and bitched at constantly.
I dunno, but next week is my last class...
Wasn't it like eighth grade?
I thought we decided that Josh was way too cool to be interested in sex, and that he's the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring him down to our level and all that...
I don't believe you.
He came into work.
Well, what am I supposed to say? "I can't wait to live in some depressing shit-hole in the middle of nowhere"?!
You're the one who's still living out some stupid seventh-grade fantasy!
I don't know... I was thinking maybe I should live alone. I decided to rent that place we looked at. I'm moving in next week.
It's fine.
Actually, he's a really nice guy.
Well I'm going to major in Business Administration and, I think, minor in Communications.
I'm taking a remedial high school art class for fuck-ups and retards.
Shhh!
Seymour does.
Him. Seymour. He's the man with the records.
That's not even --
Yes.
Did you bring that tape?
God, fuck you!
Nah, it's not so great. Here's the one I'd recommend.
Good luck...
I really didn't get a good look at her.
Fine, I'll go by myself then...
I brought it for him to autograph. He's going to be amazed to see it - it's one of two known copies... I can't believe they have him for the opening act and not the headliner. What an insult!
Look, I really appreciate your help, Enid, but let's face it, this is hopeless.
It doesn't matter, I'm not staying long... I just want to make sure I convince you not to give up yet.
No, in a lot of ways things are better now... I dunno... it's complicated. Everybody still hates each other, but they know how to hide it better, or something...
Really?
I'm starting to think that even if I did get a girlfriend it really wouldn't change anything.
It's just somebody's idea of a joke...
How can you be so sure?
Hi, it's me...
Really?
What, are you trying to get rid of me?
Aren't you even going to ask me how I'm doing?
Maybe... I dunno... He wants to be, of course. I'm weighing several offers at the present time...
I... I wish I could, Enid, but I really can't right now... I -- it's just that I --
So, do you like me, Seymour?
In whatever way you think I mean.
Nothing. Don't worry, I won't bother you any more.
Do you have anything to drink?
FUCK DANA. I'm sick of Dana.
That's great! "Half-empty" - that's what I like about you, Seymour, you're a natural pessimist!
Yeah, but still... it's kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that.
I guess I probably used to when I was your age.
I dunno, I...
Yeah, I'm really, really happy. Really having a good time.
Maybe she was just using you to try and get back at some guy. Who knows? It could be a million things. It's wasted time trying to logically figure out the female brain, that's for sure.
Forget it, there's no way... find some other poor sucker to abuse.
It's a "found object"... that's when an artist takes an ordinary object and places it in an artistic context and thus it becomes art.
Right, exactly!
She's not at home?
What? Is she having some secret affair with Josh?
Why wouldn't she tell me? There's no way! She could never keep that to herself... you're crazy.
-malaria epidemic; very sudden.
-that's ridiculous talk and you can't seriously believe it-
You don't know all that has happened here- the Devil has come to Tsavo.
My wife is the game player in the family, sir.
I've got a reason far beyond confidence: my wife is having our firstborn in five months and I promised I'd be with her when the baby comes.
Yes he is.
-what's the surprise in that, this is Africa?
I didn't conceive of it for the lions- I built one in India when there was trouble with a tiger.
You don't enjoy killing, do you?
-is it, I'm sorry, but then, of course, you're the doctor, you should know.
And anxious to get started.  What is this, mostly malaria?
So that's what a lion looks like.
Aren't we full of ourselves today?  I think it's because of the lion.
All right- let's go into battle.  I'm Redbeard.
That's very considerate.
Not for me- I'm too bulky and it's your idea, you go up there.  Take the others to the water tower for the night.
The most of any lions... a hundred...?  Probably more.  Johnny...?
Understood- you realize now you could never have done it without me.
This is more difficult-
Fine. Get started. And a strict curfew- no one allowed out at night.  Send half your men to the bridge, the rest with these two.  And I'm sorry for my tone earlier. But I repeat- there is no reason for fear. I will kill the lion and I will build the bridge.
I do, actually; very much.
Underneath.  Somewhere.
I'm sorry.  Perhaps some other time.
Certainly.
You never asked me, and every time I brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.
Well, when you started introducing me as "the old ball and chain," that's when I left.
Oscar!  You poor kid!
Oh, hello, Peter.
Yeah, it's not the kind of thing you'd want to hang in the rec room.  You know what it needs?  A fluffy little white kitten in the corner.
No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago. Come on in.  Are we having a pajama party?
It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff.  She's one of my most valuable employees.
For one night in your life, do you think it's possible for us to be completely real?
Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else.
So they bartered room and board in exchange for housekeeping services, which was a good deal for all of them because then they didn't have to withhold tax and social security, which I'm not saying is right but it's just a story, so I guess it's all right.  I can finish this later if you're tired.
Okay.
Oh, yeah, sure -- no.  But there's really not much to do here and they might need some back-up at the museum.
I know.
The Upper West Side.
Oh, Johnny.  Did you back the wrong horse.
Command me, lord.
Yes, the scourge --
-- the sorrow --
Did I forget something?
You were the one who got me in.
Yeah, I had to give her free dermabrasion for a year.  Forget it, Louis.  I could get in a lot of trouble.
Hello, Venkman.
I think we should see if we can find anything abnormal on the street.
I knew that.
You need the exercise.
A hundred and five years?  He really hung on, didn't he.
Roach breeding?  Sounds better and better.  Dana?  The boys are going down under the sewers tonight to look for slime.  Egon thinks there might even be some kind of big roach-breeding surge.  Should we forget about dinner and go with them instead?
I'm worried.  The vibrations could shake her to pieces.  We should have padded her feet.
They came from Ostrov in Eastern Poland.
You might want to check those Duke University mean averaging studies on controlled psychokinesis.
That's it.  It's on the bottom.
Who?  Just -- someone we know.
Aaah!  Nobody!  I can't tell you!
It's an interesting one, Pete.  If anything was going on it's totally subdued now.
Hold on, Ray!  Half-price!  Have you gone crazy?
This is an incredible breakthrough, Venkman. A psychoreactive substance!  Whatever this is, it clearly responds to human emotional states.
We're going down into the sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the psycho-reactive slime flow.  We thought you might want to come along.
Okay, but you're missing all the fun.
Yeah, sorry I missed it.  I guess you guys didn't know about the dress code here.  It's really kind of a coat and tie place.
Only one way to find out.  Ready, Teddy?
It likes all the sappy stuff: 'Cumbaya,' 'Everything is Beautiful,' 'It's a Small World' -- but it loves Jackie Wilson.
Yeah, I guess so.  It was the strangest thing.  I knew what I was doing but I couldn't stop.  This really terrible feeling came over me and -- I don't know -- I just felt like driving into that tree and ending it all.  Whew!  Sorry, boys.
Oh yeah?  Anytime, anytime.  Just go ahead and try it.
Groovy.  I've never felt better in my life.
You think all those predictions about the world coming to an end in the 1990s are true?
And decent.
To the bathroom, where do you think?
Yes ... well ... I'm not sure.  What I have to say may sound a little ... unusual.
I told you, I ...
Are you all right?
All right.  What do you want to do?
I'll scream.
All right.
Goodbye.
Most people can't hear me with the whole orchestra playing.  You're good.
The "stiff?"  He happens to be one of the finest musicians in the world and a wonderful man.
Well, the name Zuul refers to a demi-god worshipped around 6000 B.C. by the ... What's that say?
Really?  Can't wait to meet him.  As long as we're waiting for him, I'd really like to try something with you -- in the bedroom.
Well, I'll just use it for a while and get it right back to you.
I want you inside me.
Yes.  I'm Dr. Venkman and this is Dr. Stantz.
Back off, man!  I'm a scientist!
Is that a game?
I don't care.  I see us as tiny parts of a vast organism, like two bacteria living on a rotting speck of dust floating in an infinite void.
What is it?
I don't believe in luck.
Thank you.
Here are tonight's calls.
Yes, sir.  Don't worry.  We handle this kind of thing all the time.
You could say that.
Yes, it would.
No, you may not.
The magic word is "please."
Go ahead!  Get a court order.  Then I'm gonna sue your ass off for wrongful prosecution.
See!  They are using drugs.
Probably a mixture of gases, no doubt stolen from the Army ...
I'm studying the effect of negative reinforcement on ESP ability.
She's telling the truth -- or at least she thinks she is.
What do you mean "bad?"
What is it?
If you turn that thing off we won't be responsible for the consequences.
Gozer.
No!  Them!  Shoot them!  Cross the beams.
Or even a race memory, stored in the collective unconscious.  And I wouldn't rule out clairvoyance or telepathic contact either.
I need two new purge valves.  How's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
Peter, at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, ten people witnessed a free-roaming, vaporous, full-torso apparition.  It blew books from shelves at twenty feet away.  Scared the socks off some poor librarian.
Uh-huh.  I've heard about the rockfall, Ray. I think you've been spending too much time with Spengler.
What do we do now?
Hey, Lady?  Lady!  Can you talk?  Who are you?   This is not working.  Think of something else.
You're always so worried about your reputation.  We don't need the University. Einstein did his best stuff while he was working as a patent clerk.'They can't stop progress.
I can't take much more of this.  The pace is killing me.
The Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man!  He was on all the packages we used to buy when I was a kid.  We used to roast Stay-Puft marshmallows at Camp Waconda!
Yeah, I heard that.  Now tell me what you really do.
Boy!  Solid cores of shielded Selenium .325.
And the seas would boil ...
Every ancient religion had its own myth about the end of the world.
We're nearly there, Lucilla.
I want every single thing that belonged to my father out of this house!  If it's worth something then sell it!
If I may be so bold...
Why not do it in the Colosseum?
You can't do that!  You came here to turn the crowd around not make them hate you.
Taking my pleasure.  Do I need to clear my lovers with you?
The fans of Narcissus.  They were on vigil outside the school of Proximo. They believe he's dying.
If I ever loved Narcissus it wasn't like you want.
Yes?  Go on!
You would have had a full scale revolt on your hands.
Oh, but with the army behind you, you could become extremely political.  Not a Republican by any chance?
We have to stop the Germans now!
Cooperate and they will be returned to your estate.  I could have executed you.
If you set me free I will find my way back to the army, march on Rome and depose you.  Then, the army and I will restore the Republic so that animals like you will never control human destinies again.
Ignore that?!  The sooner we leave this disgusting place the better.
Until your confirmation date.
Yes.  You know, that's not a bad idea.
We can crush Gaius another way. What if you do throw something to the people they really want?  Make them a gift of food.
Jerses -- tomorrow...
Yes, Caesar.
I don't know...
But have never been?
They can't... if this is Rome...
For the sake of the Gods, you're not leading these men?  How like my father you are.  You 'believe'... I guess that's why you're still alive.
The fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when they're most vulnerable.
There's no reason to say that. Everyone knows you're going to be well.  I had Servis groom your horse for a triumphal visit to the front at first light.
So I understand.
On your honor as a Roman officer, daddy?
I can't let you do that.
I was summoned.
The 'people'?, listen to the people, they know what they want:  A government that gives them what they need and doesn't bother them with messy thoughts of issues.  You know, messy... thinking.  They want a dictator!  As far as the children, there is only one thing that every Roman child dreams of:  being you! A famous gladiator!
If you win, you know, you have to stay.  It's the losers who get to go home.  Besides, I'm not so sure it is over.  Centurions report enemy scouts probing our lines.
Who else?  I'm the one who runs the estates while you're here risking everything we have for the glory of Rome!  Or for the glory of you!
I killed too many barbarians.
I am the man who might save your life -- give you a bit more life at any rate.  I am Proximo Palindromos head of this gladiatorial school which is named after me.  I own this school and everything that's in it.  You're in it!  But why?  What did a Roman general do to get himself condemned to the Colosseum? Understand, we usually get corn thieves and pick pockets.  Please, I separated you from the others because...  ... my nose tells me you've been condemned for important reasons.
Alive... I'm alive...
Lucky it didn't step on his head.
You were a soldier, and then a gladiator, weren't you?
Hello.
Yes.
No.
No.
Yes.
No.
No -- why should I?
I'm sorry I took you in there.
But, Elaine --
But could I just tell you this one thing?
No -- I was just thinking -- look -- it's still early -- we could do something -- go somewhere else.
Yes. She had a husband and a son.
Hurry up. Put your shoes on.
That woman --
Maybe we could get together some time and talk about it.
Because -- I am.
Then what?
No. I have two. The other one is the one I'm looking for.  What's this?  It's from my grandmother.
The belt I'm looking for was from my grandmother.
No.
I don't know.
I might.
I don't know. I don't know what's happening.
Carl who?
Carl Smith. He's a medical student. We've known him for years.
No, Benjamin.
Yes, sir.
Yes I am.
Okay. Enough said. That's a deal.
Oh -- no sir.
Look -- she's all right. She's upset and she screamed. But she's okay now.
I am going to call the police now.
All right. Put it in the room where we were.
Mrs. Robinson -- I don't quite know how to put this --
-- and I was wondering if I could buy you a drink or something --
Uh -- The Taft Hotel.
No. Now I know it's pretty late and if you'd rather --
The Singleman party, sir?
Well it's in the car. It's out in the car.
Fine, thank you. The bathroom is down at the end of the hall.
What?
No.
What for?
But it's light in there now.
Look -- I drove you home. I was glad to do it. But I have some things on my mind. Can you understand that?
What do you drink?
Mrs. Robinson -- if you don't mind my saying so -- this conversation is getting a little strange. Now I'm sure that Mr. Robinson will be here any minute and --
What?
Pardon?
What's wrong?
It's all right.
Benjamin?
Because you're going to bed. I don't think I should be up here.
What if he did?
Oh my God.
Let me out!
Oh. Hello. Hello.
Why don't I get it? Well -- I will then.  If you'll excuse me.
That's fine.
This is all terribly wrong.
No -- but look -- maybe we could do something else together, Mrs. Robinson -- would you like to go to a movie.
Are you kidding?
Well?
How about art.
You start it off. I don't know anything about it.
I don't.
I mean everything. I don't know anything about how you -- how you work this. I don't know how you get out of the house at night. I don't know the risk involved.
What?
We don't.
About five years.
Now and then. He gets drunk a few times a year.
On New Year's Eve. Sometimes on his birthday.
I don't.
Think real hard, Benjamin.
That's enough.
Benjamin, don't you ever take that girl out.
Let's drop it.
I wouldn't know.
I see.
Are you?
Now don't start this.
Well two minutes ago you told me I wasn't good enough for your daughter. Now you say you're sorry I got that impression.
Thank you.
I can makes things quite unpleasant.
Then you'd better start believing me.
Sir?
Very good, sir.
What?
Well this is your business, Benjamin.  If you --
Goodnight, Benjamin.
Next time he suggests it, I'll tell him I have no intention of ever calling her up in my life.
-- worried?
You got me.
Swell. I appreciate it.
Oh no.
I've got to go.
No. No -- I'm just -- I'm just a little worried about my future. I'm a little upset about my future.
You'll never be young again.
Oh yes.
What would you say to a short one? Bourbon still your drink?
Mr. Robinson?
Do you want to unclench your fists, please? Thank you. I can see in the dark, you know. I've been here quite a while.
You don't respect me terribly much either, do you?
Shaking hands. Well, that's not saying much for my wife, is it?
Dad -- can you listen --
I could take care of her.
Why?
No --
With the pearls?
What about the money?
Who?
Oh -- work!!
Dictation.  You know...
Money -- Ever heard of it?
You're very funny --
Yesterday -- yes -- that was yesterday.
I thought that, too -- but I found that it does. Come along, dance with Kringelein.
And Baron, thanks so much for everything.
Nerves -- just nerves. You must forgive me. I have had a bad evening. I am very tired. Do you know what it is to be tired -- tired of a routine existence?
I did not know you were so beautiful... and --
You mustn't talk Russian to me.
And...?
I should like to smoke.
Because I can see something in the mirror that you cannot. My dear --
And then, in the war, to kill and hide. That's all.
I wanted money desperately -- Can you understand? -- That's why I wanted the pearls. I was threatened -- I was desperately in need of a certain big sum of money. I've been following you -- I've admired you. But I have forced myself not to think about you -- Last night, at last, I managed to came into your room and -- and now.
For Vienna?
Oh no -- that would spoil everything. I'll -- I will manage somehow -- I'll manage myself. I will go with you. When does the train leave?
I'll go. -- I love you.  I'll be on that train. I'll get the money.
Why do you think --
Bless you --
Not at all, sir.
I'd like to Kringelein, but I can't -- I am broke!
I do drink, Baron -- I drink to you, Baron and to win.  It's good, -- come along, Baron.
All of that at once, Baron?
Oh -- yes -- that's it -- you found it -- you found it for me, Baron.
Oh, no, stay here, Baron -- stay.
I thought she was splendid!
No doubt you would, Baron. But do you know, I'm quite indispensable to her. I'm her ballet master and her nurse. I hardly belong to myself anymore. But, there you are, it's Grusinskaya -- you can't help adoring her.
Insolent -- Berlin manners.
We shall see who remains here the longer.
No -- letters to two-eighty.
What? -- Who? -- Whom?
No, doctor.
This gentleman can have my room.
You are ill.
I have nothing better to do, Mr. Kringelein.
Yes, thanks to the Baron. The best shops, the very best. Look, Doctor, silk -- feels so nice on the skin... a London hat, see -- made in England, that's silk, too -- fifty marks... Look, the price is on it. That was half my salary before. The Baron is a very fine gentleman -- no one in my life has been so nice to me as the Baron.
Haven't you anyone -- Haven't you anybody -- you -- I mean -- Are you all alone in the world.
Try and sleep, Kringelein, don't be afraid.
More than fourteen thousand marks... were in that pocketbook.
No.
Silk -- think of that -- silk -- they are, too.
I'm waiting for him here. The Baron and I have been together all day. A hundred miles an hour -- in a motor car -- and in an aeroplane -- It was marvelous --
She's beautiful -- isn't she?
I didn't like Preysing right off.
You don't understand that do you?
Later?
Is the bill ready -- the lady's too?
Moreover...
Moreover -- Do you mind if I smoke?  I went to Florence once, too.
What?
Definitely off.
Sit here.  Cognac -- for you?
You mean Baron von Gaigern?
You think so?
We have a good many connections in England, naturally.
Gentlemen, I am now free to announce...  ...that the deal between my firm and the Manchester Cotton Company has been successfully negotiated.
Next week.
I've done my hair differently -- do you like that?
The house is not full -- Is it really full?
Why not?
Such nonsense.
Again?
I don't know you.
He tried to rob me -- he is dead --
I can answer for this, it was self- defense -- I can answer for this -- but that girl -- the scandal -- my wife -- my daughters, you know them?
You are late. Hurry.
Have I kept you waiting?
I want to see her, I want to do some dictating -- report of the conference for my father-in-law.
You mean, the insurance frammis?
What's that, Lilly?
Oh, thanks, Bobo.
Roy? He's always crying.
Hah.
Good evening. I'd like a single for tonight.
Fine.
Oh, Henry, no, that's just boring.
Henry, no!
I must admit, Mister Fellowes, I had moments I was worried.
You know who I work for.
Delmar? I never go out to California. That's a thousand miles from here.
It's not your fault.
You are seeing it. You're looking right at it.
Roy Dillon.
Lead on.
So I heard.
I don't know offhand what your best year's been, we can look it up. The idea is, we'll top it by fifteen percent.
Perk.
Maybe I'm just not ready for that yet.
I guess I owe you my life.
Just a little accident. I went by your place, picked up your mall. Just bills, I'll take care of them.
Whatever you say. The manager says your boss called.  Really pulled the wool over everybody's eyes, huh?
No. And you have to be.
We won't hit the track. The beach. Couple a nice restaurants.
I pay my debts.
No can do. Have to dip in and out of my bag too much. Besides, it'll heal in the air.
I guess not. You'll be heading east from here, huh?
Well, that's good news.
I've really got to --
As though you do what I say.
This way's perfect.
You're smart, Lilly, and you're good-looking. You won't have any trouble finding a job.
Not any more. Lilly, listen, I'm giving you good advice. I'm following it myself.
Oh, you'll live, Lilly.
Oh? I didn't know anything was.
Never.
I don't?
A future. The only future I've got.
I have to have that money, Roy. What do I have to do to get it?
You're too young. You should be in school.
Taking you for granite?
I'm a salesman.
The long end. Big con.
Upstate where?
Separate bathrooms, darling. I will not lay out all my cosmetics for you to knock over.
Open your door.
I saw her.
I'm well connected, Roy, Cole introduced me to a lot of people. Very valuable. Valuable for us.
But the setup's there. It's there now.
) What?
I'm wise to you, I should have seen it before, you rotten son of a bitch. How is it, huh? How do you like --
Yes?
Thank you.
Gun?
It may be Lilly, but it isn't suicide.
My mother... Well, I guess it doesn't matter now. She worked for gamblers. She always knew they might turn on her some day.
I'm sorry, that's an unfortunate phrase, it slipped out, I'm, to tell you the truth, Mr. Dillon, this isn't an everyday occurrence around here.
Not many.
They said on the phone you were assigned to the Meyers case.
Girl scouts.
What do you want me to do, put out an A.P.B. on a man in overalls wearing a white mask dragging a headstone?
It's Blake.  How do you feel about Wisconsin?
Do I know you?
Would somebody shut this guy up?
You sure?
Nothing's missing?
I was trying to get away from someone.
I was trying to protect you from this...
John...
Call me Laurie, will ya?
Why not?
Is that all you guys can think about?  Amy never came back last night.  Maybe she's in trouble.
Then you come out here.
He's been living out of moving boxes for three months.
I'm fine.  I just need to lie down...
Yeah.
He gave me a fuckin' A?  Wow.
You're unbelievable.
You think they'll let him in dressed like that?
Reality check, dillweed.  This is 1995.
The kids at school said this is a haunted house -- that a bad man used to live here.
Okay ... But just for tonight.
Debra, you're fuckin' insane.
Jamie?  But I thought she was --
Mrs. Strode, Michael Myers is here to kill his family.  And he won't stop until you are all destroyed.  I only thank God that I found you before he did.
Black magic ...  'In ancient times, Thorn was believed to cause sickness, famine and death. Translated literally, it was the name of a demon spirit that delivered human sacrifices ... on the Celtic celebration of Samhain.'
'When applied directly to another person, Thorn could be used to call upon them confusion and destruction -- to literally visit them with the Devil.'
Kara, no!
That's the whole idea of living in the country.  I thrive on the seclusion.
Sam, you know you never fail to amaze me.  Yesterday happily retired, today right back in the thick of things. Somehow I knew you still had it in you.
It was you.
Stay away, Sam.
Dr. Loomis, thank God you're here.  You heard her, didn't you?  It was Jamie.
I'm Tommy.  Tommy Doyle.  Laurie Strode -- Jamie's mother -- she was baby-sitting for me that night --
Didn't recognize you.
Home.  Jesus.  I'm like this.  Home!
You know what gets me?
The time we were in a tree for fourteen days, you certainly tried to tell me everything about Mrs. Wheeler.
The hell with the diamonds!
Go home!  Show them how rich you are for a change!
Go home.
I'm certainly not going to come horning back into your life tomorrow, and I will not welcome your horning back into mine.  A chapter has ended.  We are old comrades--at a parting of the ways.
Go home!
You know me, boy.
When?
In what way, pray tell?
Tit for tat--as simple as that.
You did?
You're an imbecile.
You've come to the right man.
What you say is, "Pass the fucking catsup."
It's engineered to last about fifteen years.
For what?
We're ahead of schedule, that's all. You're finding out here what you would have found out in Africa-- that you are a rabbit, born to be eaten alive.
Out!
As a matter of fact--
Hello.
I'll see.
Tell me some true stories about Dad.
"The sting."
Wow.
I don't know.
Mhravitch.
When I grow up, I'm going to go to Mhravitch.
I wanted to go out for football, but Mom was afraid I'd get hurt.
Oh no, no, no, no, no.  It can't be. How embarrassing.
No, no, no, no, no.
Go ahead.  No, no, no, no.
Will you go to bed?
Make it fast.
Welcome to manhood, you little sparrowfart!  Load that gun!
I don't want to fight you.
It's your house, Dad.
Daughter--I love you very much.
Destiny often seems that way. You're going to marry me.
How do you do, Mrs. Ryan?  I'd heard you were beautiful, and so you are.  Am I intruding here?
We adjust to what there is to adjust to.  Perhaps Paul, being young, can adjust to joy or grief immediately.  I hope he can.  I will take a little longer.  I'll be as quick as I can.
I don't know.  This is a new disease to me.
We thought it was an emergency.
Nothing would please me more.
You and your damned bedside manner and your damned little black bag full of miracles.  You know who filled that bag for you?  Not Alice-sit-by-the-fires like yourself.  Men with guts filled it, by God--men with guts enough to pay the price for miracles--suffering, ingratitude, loneliness, death--
It's so--so stark.
Just--bang--we have a honeymoon.
You shouldn't have talked to Norbert that way.
I have a brain.
Ram it up your ass!
We're all going to have to go out for breakfast.  The cook quit yesterday.
It's complicated and I don't want to go into it now, because it's bound to sound insulting--even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted.  It's just the truth.
I don't think so.
What are you going to do?
No you're not!
If he wants to go.
More nerve than the doctor, I must admit.  He hasn't been home for two days.  Has he suddenly lost interest in sleep and color television--and the violin?
Hope.
He's afraid of you, Harold.  He knew you'd want to fight him.  He doesn't know anything about fighting.  He hates pain.
Sounds quite beautiful.
Of course he can go--if he'll just go down on his hands and knees for a moment--and promise me that he does not find me comical in the least degree.
Gentlemen--that's nice.
Ahh--then she's still alive.
I've literally got to run!
A policeman delivered the baby in a taxicab.
What next?  You leave promptly, of course.  There is no question as to whose home this is--
Whose son this is, whose wife that is.  A fiancé is the most ridiculous appurtenance this household could have at this time.  Good night.
What a brilliant diagnosis!
I know malaria.  Malaria isn't caused by the bites of bats.
I've never heard of it.
You were wrong, you quack!
The same hairy, humorless old gods who move you from hither to yon. "Honor, " if you like.
We do survive, don't we?  You're going to have to apologize, of course, for calling me a bastard. That's a matter of form--not allowing you or anybody to call me a bastard.  No rush about that. Just remember to apologize sometime soon.
And terror, if you don't mind.
Evolution has made you a clown-- with a cigar.  Simple butchers like you are obsolete!
In any event, I will not beg for mercy.
Don't you laugh even inwardly at the heroic balderdash you spew?
You aren't going to hurt me.  You aren't going to hurt anybody any more.  Any violent gesture will seem ridiculous--to yourself!
I'm utterly satisfied.
I've enjoyed being man.
For what it's worth now, Harold Ryan, the clown, gives his sacred word.
So that's it! "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum." Everybody was yelling "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum." I thought it was some foreign language.
For saying "shit." Or is that okay now?
My mother-in-law.  Fire engines, pulmotors, doctors, cops, coroners--
Yeah--cripes.  I never did get any sense out of Alice.  She found me holding up the old lady, dead as a mackerel.  It was a bitch.  You know--maybe Mrs. Wheeler was going to die then and there anyway, even if I'd been the paper boy.  Maybe not.  I dunno, boy.  That's civilian life for you.  Who knows what kills anybody?
That's what he wanted--a ten-year- old wife.  He'd come home from a war or a safari, and he'd wind up talking to the little kids.
Do I have to?  Who's the little girl?
Everybody talks about how rotten kids act.  Grownups can be pretty rotten, too.
J. Edgar Hoover plays sports.
There stands the loins from which you've sprung.
It's jungle rot!  This room is making everybody sick!  This is your family doctor speaking now.  Here--I brought you something else to hang on your wall, for the sake of variety.
Maybe it's supposed to end now. Maybe God wouldn't have it any other way.
He is my father.
I know.
I don't want to go to Vanderbilt.
That's when I'll get my confidence back.
We could have had some kind of birthday party for him.  We could have taken Paul to the fight with us.
Far as I know.
He ditched me.  He started running, and I started running, then he lost me in the park.
You're saying no.
What's so wonderful if I lost the sale?  You poor kid.
Would you like to say something about killing, Colonel?
Tonight's the night.
That's the XKE.
It's suicide!
Paul's only twelve years old.
We've got to rescue him.
He's not your son.
I believe in miracles now.
It's really that bad?
Oh--look at the poor, crucified violin, would you?
Goodbye.
That's not true either--or needn't be, unless we make it true.
Which we do.  But we can stop doing that.
I'm sick of this argument.  I just have one more thing to say: If you elect a President, you support him, no matter what he does.  That's the only way you can have a country!
It's good.  Let him go.
What a beautiful demonstration this is of the utter necessity of rites of passage.
Jack the Ripper plays shuffleboard.
Shit! You just don't want to hire a nigger, that's all. I knew this was a scam. I shouldn'ta come.
Are you going to stiff me?
What do you want to tip me for? Look, you got to spell it out. Whatever you want, just say it.
Yeah.
What girls you got here?
Overpowering?
Do you know where she lives?
Tod might know.
Tonight. When you get out, we'll go.  Why didn't you tell the other detective?
Yeah.  I'm her father.
You used to work at Copper Penny?
Not very.
Christian Reformed. It's a Dutch Calvinist denomination.
They believe in the 'TULIP.'
T stands for Total depravity, that is, all men, through original sin, are totally evil and incapable of good. 'All my works are like filthy rags in the sight of the Lord.'
Fuck.
Wait, wait. I'm trying to figure this out. This is like Rona Barrett. Before you become saved, God already knows who you are?
You really believe all that?
I thought I was fucked up.
Where does he live.
What makes you so sure?
But then you'll forget about me.
That's right.
What are you paying me for?
What do you mean?
No.
But the police...
Get out!
I'm sorry about that. Have you found anything out? You've got to tell me.
Like what?
No. Thanks anyway. I've got to get over to the office.
Yeah. She's quite upset. I'm going to fly out today. They want me to bring some pictures.
That's not true, Jim. In fact, I think you're very close to the type we're looking for.
It was called 'Slave of Love.'
Yeah.
I want to know where my daughter is. Her name is Kristen, or Joanne. She's with you.
Let's go.
No.
My secretary said you wanted to discuss a business proposition.
Oh.  Why is it that you want to get into film financing?
Okay. Keep in touch with my secretary.
Why don't you just go outdoors, mister? Cool off.
What do you think of that? Or this?
Well, he can just fuck himself.
Oh no? What you gonna do? Get a job?
You don't have to get uppity with me, Bill. I remember when you was running that car wash and couldn't make it go. And what was that other thing you tried? A Dairy Queen? Went busted too.
Nope never saw her before.  Kurt, come over here. Don't use underage kids. Wouldn't touch 'em for all the cow shit in Mexico.  You recognize this piece of wool, Kurt?
You working in San Diego now?
Political Science. It's all about what's going on.
I don't have one. I don't believe in them.
Yes. You see I have to plant my tree.
I'm a file clerk.
Harrison. Harrison Feed and Grain... At Hamilton and Fourth... I'm in charge of the invoices... And I type up the schedule for the trucking fleet...
A rather free translation but nonetheless correct. Greetings to you too, my little one.  Tell me, what do you see?
Harold Chasen.
What?
Oh.
Well, then, you must come back and visit.
Oh, I'm so happy you said that because I wanted to show you my paintings. This is the "Rape of Rome" and, of course, there in the corner is quite a graphic depiction of Leda and the Swan.
Yes. Very much.
Oh. Eh, I like it.
Sterling silver. It was my dear mother-in-law's, part of a dinner set of fifty pieces. It's one of the few things that survived.  Oh, but I do rattle on so. Tell me about yourself, Harold.  What do you do when you aren't visiting funerals?
Because they are all the same.
Well...
Is he all right?
Well, I really don't drink...
My umbrella?  Oh, that's just a relic. I found it when I was packing to come to America. It used to be my defense on picket lines and rallies and political meetings - being dragged off by police or attacked by thugs of the opposition.  A long time ago.
Superb.
Why? There'll be a new block of ice in the morning.
Well, why don't you?
Well, don't go.
Well, they're my species.
Oh, you've thought of everything. And champagne.
Oh, Harold.
It's true. I can't live without you.
Well, not <u>dying</u>, actually. I'm changing. You know, like from winter to spring. Of course, it is a big step to take.
Not now, Harold...  You can't put me down for Monday?
To whom?
Harold!
Perhaps it is.
No, thank you. They stain my fingers.
No. I'm learning the banjo. Do you?
Ah, yes.
I'm sure. But what else do you do with your time? Do you go to school?
Yes. What kind of things do you do?
I don't know.
No.
No.
Yes.
Yes.
You think so, sir?
To pit your own life against another.
Yes.
Harold! That's <u>disgusting</u>!
Harold!
She's a Commie pig. We're going to nail every last one...
Perhaps you're teasing us. Are you teasing us?
Sorry, friend. No day trips to Hell. Here you are. Here you stay. And forward the only way to go.
What?
Hey, so for it. Don't let pity stop you. I'm down. Nail me.
The box? Like in your story? Like in his house?
WHY?
Finish what?
And what about you?
No more deals, Kirsty. It's your flesh we want to experience, not your skill at bargaining.
It's you! You HAVEN'T always been as you are. You were HUMAN. Remember. Remember all your confusions. Think!
Red, I found something --
I'm lucky that way.
Red -- you need to hear the rest of the information --
Amongst other things, yes -- but that's hardly the point.
There is a place -- a dark place where evil slumbers and awaits to return. From there it infects our dreams. Our thoughts. Grigory gave us a glance tonight --
I know where to find him. I'll get him back.
Oh, stop that --  Damn! Be careful, there --
That's not how she feels. She may never feel it.
Icthyo Sapiens, April 14, 1865.
Abe possesses a unique frontal lobe.  "Unique." That's a word you'll hear quite a bit around here.
Impressive. Do you remember what it said?
"In the absence of light, darkness prevails." For there are things that go bump in the night, Agent Myers.  We are the ones who bump back.
I wanted to see her.  It's nobody's business.
Grounded? Who's grounded?
Not so fast. He barely knows him --
That's what you do. That's why we need you. You have an insight.  You know monsters.
No. I never was.
Professor, that girl you were talking about --
I think I can help -- Talk to her -- I can bring her back.
Start in, you got nachos coming.
Not from you.
On a scale of one to ten: two. But --  -- she'll take care of you, Myers. She's a tough one.
Just a scratch.  I wanted to see you.
For a cup of coffee, but go ahead, read.
Marco...
I know.
Don't know. Really. I grew up with him.  I've missed him too, but now, every time I see him, I get confused. Hardly a day goes by he's not in my mind. Even now, I feel he's here --
What's the problem?
Hi.
Sure.
Do you really need this bed, lady?
Uh-huh.
Her mother's dead.
It's just a puzzle box.
No!
You did this before, right?
HE did. I've seen him.
Stay the fuck away from me.
I have to speak to my father.
First things first. You can have a telephone when we've talked. Do you know who did this to you?
Oh Christ.
That's right. Who are you?
Hurting.
Good.
What?
Not know.
What kind of doors?
And you came back here to solve the puzzle --
Who did?
Maybe.
Which is where?
I have to see my father.
Ah!
You mean we're moving in?
It looks like a bomb's dropped.
O.K.
What's wrong with you?
What?
Not much.
I... suppose so, yes.
That's right.
I prefer the floor.
Yeah, why don't I?
Maybe I will.
Steve.
No Dad.
You like?
Is Julia here?
Sure.
I've forgotten.
Never better. You sleep well.
Maybe you should give it some time.
She's not like Mom. She's... I don't know... moody. I thought that was what you liked about her.
No. You don't understand. Your brother -- Frank -- he's here in the house. And he's --
So lie down.
I AM house-trained.
Please. I want to see you home. All right?
What happened to you?
What things?
Don't let them take me, Steve --
'Bye.
Really.
What's next?
Since when did this shop become a fascist regime?
Great.  That's the fun of working in a record store.  Playing crappy pap you don't want to listen to.  I thought this tape was going to be, you know, a conversation stimulator. I was going to ask you for your top five records to play on a Monday morning and all that, and you just had to ruin it.
But now I kind of like it.
No, but would you think, from that one sentence.  That I was going to see it?
Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
You are not in a band, Barry.  You are not a musician.  And no posters.
Whatever.  Okay. "Tell Laura I Love Her." That'd bring the house down. Laura's mom could sing it.
Haven't seen it.
Oh.  Right.  But I'd forgotten about that.  I wasn't biting the idea.
What do you think?  Dick likes it.
Do not get ahead of yourself.
I have a television.
Nothing.  I just prefer the other one.
Isn't her album called "Number Four With A Smile?"
Nobody.
Anna who?  Anna Green Gables?  Anna Conda?
No.  No.  Mom wants you to come to the funeral.  It's on Friday.
The Malcolm McClaren of Clark Street is in his executive suite.  Do you have an appointment?
Well, I used to go to the Dodger on your nights, and I saw you're doing it again and that your putting out a record, and it's sort of a then-and- now story against the backdrop of the Chicago music scene with the emphasis on now.
I thought I would ask you a few questions if that's okay.
Yeah.  I could show it to you if you want to come over and see it.
OF COURSE... Well yeah, a bit. "Sin City" by the Flying Burrito Brothers is an all-time top five, but I wouldn't play it at the club.  It's a country-rock ballad.  Everybody'd go home.
That's five.  So.  Why did you decide to deejay again?
What's his name?
"Music for Old People." What does that mean?
Oh, you know... a lot of people aren't too old for clubs but they're too old for acid jazz and garage and ambient and all that.  They want to hear old funk and Stax and New Wave and Old School Hip Hop and some new stuff all together and there's nowhere for them.
Yeah.  A billion.  Right... How are you?
Fuck!  I knew it!  You're going through one of those what-does-it- all-mean things.
The new Belle and Sebastian.  Like it?
Fine.
I want a tape.
Come on, Rob.  My relationship with Laura has obviously disturbed you a great deal.
We've done the hard part now.  I might as well, you know...
Hi.
It's not like saying that at all, actually, Rob.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye make pop records --
Just the obvious stuff.
Why is that childish?  Your living with the guy!  I'm just asking how it's going.
So, what, you haven't definitely decide to dump me?  There's still a chance we'll get back together?
Okay, okay, we have a nine percent chance of getting back together. Does that clarify the situation?
You really think it would make a difference either way?
Will you please just go?
No, not -- I mean have you, you know --
It's me.
Jesus.  I do not know.  I'll talk to you later.
You still together?  Going all right?
That bad, eh?
I'm sorry, but can we get this straight?  What is his fucking name, Ian or Ray?  What do you call him?
Mmm hmm.
I can't talk right now.
I don't care.  As long as you don't expect me to hold your hand.
Uh... No.
I don't want to go back.
Yes, of course.  There's nothing to worry about.
I'm too tired not to go out with you.
What's the difference?
No, but...
And hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and...
I'm alright.
Wanna go to dinner?
I know.  But you've never met.  It just seems like a stone unturned in your relationship with him.
I tricked you into meeting some people you'd think were great.  I thought it would be fun to introduce you to someone with a Tina Turner album and then see whether you still felt the same way.
WHAT?
I'm going to talk to you about whether you want to get married or not.  To me.
Would you marry me if I was?
Hey.  It's Liz.
You called this morning?
It's true!
What difference does it make?
Enough of what?
Yup.  Not far from here, actually.
Everything go alright?
Thank you.
No way!  I'd cramp his style.  And I wouldn't want to listen to all that stuff happening on the other side of the bedroom wall.  I'm way to unattached for that.
Yeah, I know the Crumblers!  I bought a used Blasters album in New York about ten years ago and somebody left a Crumblers single in it.  My everything changed for a couple of weeks.
Exactly!  Fucking ex-actly!
I'd better go.  I gotta get up early. Go over to my parents'.
Yeah.
God, you ask a lot of questions.
Mom!  For the last fucking time, I'm telling you Laura didn't want to get married!  She is not that kind of girl!  To use a phrase.  That's not what happens now.
That wasn't part of the deal.  I want to be poisonous but fair.
Suit yourself.  There are plenty of others who will.
Records are those big round black things, right?
Yeah.
Sure.
This one came unassembled.
The boy _died_?
So's playing choo-choo with two high school cheerleaders in the middle of-
Good day, Miss Cartwright.
Probably.
People like that rarely leave business cards.
At the moment?  Carl Smith.
Not your concern.
Go home.
You're a fool.
You are.  Now.
The only real difficulty comes in changing over the ownership of property I've aquired.  That requires certain records and most importantly a personal appearance at the county seat in Gettysburg.  But that's where you come in.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
That's why Smith called you MacLeod.
Empty.  And fear.  Fear of those that would kill you and fear of those that would love you.  It can never last, and in the end you always end up destroying both.
It's all the same.  Half lives that never go away.
All of it finished.
I can't stand it.  Oh God, I can't stand it!
No!
The inheritance.
You have lived forever.
Now there's a new topic.
What are you getting at, Moran?
What's all of this got to do with me?
It's bullshit.  Everything. My job, the people I get involved with, I'm up to here with it.
Not who.  What.  Worstick's a town in Pennsylvania.
You see that desk?  _Your_ desk?  You see the crap piled up on it?
What are you doing man?
-In nomine sanctus esperitu-
And but for a mark you are well as any man, no?
And now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew.
You know me home.  Me name.
You are the same?
Yes.  Always.
This can't be.
This is monstrous.  I'll burn in hell for all eternity.
Of course.
Who?
That's mad.  Surely you don't take their word?
I'll not take that kind of talk from you.  From those others below, maybe.  But not from you.
Perhaps not.  You seem to have misplaced a private.  No doubt by now his head is stranger to his neck.
You surprise me.  Eliminating a rival like that.  Such are the actions of a man of conquest.  I was mistaken.  300 years have turned the boy's fear into ambit- ion.
I know you very well, Conor MacLeod. And I can see the truth beginning to make itself clear to you.  Mulet, Romirez, they were fools without vision.  It was destined that the board would be cleared for the real players.
So sure?
We need more time.
It can be different.  It must be.
Have you time for some- thing to eat?
Won't know till the records department comes back with it this after- noon.  Looks good though. They found the receipt in his townhouse.  It was pretty smeared but had Taupin's father listed as a signatory.
I don't know.
He knows I'm here.  How?
How many places this side of the Atlantic serve lager and lime?
Neuvich, the clown of the crusades.
He always did.
MACLEOD!
Leave her out of this.
And if I refuse?
His only kid.
No.
I'm sure that's true.
The Sheriff has just received four more letters threatening his life, but he says nothing can interfere with his duty.
No, just a farewell appearance, batting for Sweeney. I'm going into business for myself.
No. Roy. Roy V.
Sort of a Jack London style?
Even ten minutes is a long time to be away from you.
It will be perfectly all right, Walter. Mother is coming with us on the train.
You're so nice, Bruce, you think everybody else is.
He certainly -- hic -- does!
And what's the matter with a thousand dollars?
Better make that a certified check, Walter.
On second thought, would you let me have it? I'll get the tickets.
Believe me, Bruce, I know what I'm doing. He'd get you in a crap game --
I lost my wallet.
Yes, he is... Look, Bruce, we're taking that next train -- and when I say next train, this time I mean it!
Not through any help of yours, Hildy.
Bruce, you know I'm mad about you and stop talking like that.  Walter!
Yes!

Oh.
Where are we going?
Feels awful good. Yes, sir -- we're taking the four o'clock train to Albany and tomorrow we'll be married.
I don't think she'll need you very much -- I aim to do most of the protecting myself.
Yes, I know...  Hildy, will you ever forget the night you brought the Governor back to your hotel room and found me taking a bath? She didn't even know I was in town...
Just Sweeney again. One of my best reporters.
It's simple. A poor little dope who lost his job went berserk and shot a cop who was coming after him to quiet him down.
How?
Well, you'll take care of her. After all, if that doctor's right, I'm going to live for a long time yet. Look, Bruce, this is a debt of honor. I was a very bad husband: Hildy could have got a lot of alimony if she'd wanted to, but she wouldn't take any. She had it coming to her, but she was too independent.
Figure it this way: I ought to be good for twenty-five years. By that time, you'll probably have made enough so that the money won't mean anything. But suppose you haven't made good -- don't you think Hildy's entitled to a quiet old age without any worries?
No, Bruce, you didn't come between us. It was all over for her before you came on the scene. For me -- it'll never be over.
Certified! I'm afraid Hildy'd feel ashamed to think she hadn't trusted you.
So long.
Come on, Hildy, we've got to keep going! Sorry, Bruce, but --
And now I don't know where my mother is. She may be lost.
Close that door. Don't let anybody in or out.
I'll give you three minutes to tell me where he is.
No, you don't!
Out of the mouths of babes.
What did you say your name was -- Pinkus?
I notice you still remember it.
Divorced me. It sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself. It almost gives him a feeling he wasn't wanted.
I wasn't satisfied! I suppose I proposed to you!
What's the matter?
No!
Listen, you bumble-headed baboon --
Who says I can't? You're a newspaper man.
Bermuda... Rich, eh?
Say, could I meet him?
Now you got me.
What for?
Oh, I'm sorry.
How do you like that? Here I am being nice to you and your sweet-heart and that's the thanks I get!
I might have, Walter, but you were never there.
So -- Sweeney gets twins -- and Earl Williams gets hanged tomorrow.
Because it happened to be a colored policeman.
You see what I had to put up with? She never trusted me! You argue with her -- otherwise you're going on a honeymoon with blood on your hands!
No thanks, I've still got those. Well, I'll step into some working clothes and hop over to the Press Room for the background on this yarn. It'll be kind of fun to see the boys again, too. Remember, Bruce, it must be certified.
Let go o' me! I've got to get Bruce out of jail! Oh, Walter, why did you have to do this to me?
Let me get at that typewriter and I'll show you how a doll-faced mugg can write!
Whoa -- wait a minute. We can't leave Williams here. One of the other fellows'll --
Huh!
Call him a love-child, if you want to.  Duffy!
Hildy, you think I could? After this story?  Here! You're just nervous.
I'm looking at you -- you murderer!
Shut up, will you?  You sure? Nobody?
That dumb immigrant'll flop on me. I know it.  Can you imagine Butch doing this to me -- at a time like this?
Come here. See if we can move it.
Well, if it's my last story, I'd like it to be a good one. But -- I guess I can't, Walter.
Yeah. I suppose I could. But, Walter --
I don't know what to do, Walter.
It's awfully clear now. Bruce needs a wife who can give him a home -- and affection -- and peace. I couldn't do that for him, Walter. I'm what you made me -- a cheap reporter who'd give up her soul for a story!... Is that job still open?
Niagara Falls! Walter, you don't mean that?
What's the matter with my brains?
I was in here -- and they had some kind of murderer in with them. They were hiding him!
Beat it out and get hold of some guys.
I mean real money -- not counterfeit!
You're crazy. Where's Mac?
They can't do that to me!
You said it!
It doesn't matter. The publicity's the main thing.
In a legal sense, yes. But not actually. Actually, I'm innocent. I didn't do anything.
Well, it wasn't exactly that way --
Three bullets! Any good?
Run down and get some smelling salts, will you?
Well, if she's gonna write fiction, there's nothing like being a reporter.
Lioness Rushes to Defense of Cub.
Do you want us to call the cops and have them give you the boots?
Three sixes. Is that any good?
So long, Hildy.
Now, where is he?
Now, wait a minute! I'm not afraid of anything. What were you going to write about Williams?
I've got a right to carry a gun if I want to.
The names are Merwyn D. Mayor, who is the Mayor's brother-in-law --
That's good, because my health ain't what it used to be.
Well, there's a lot of Communistic sympathizers around --
But we're going to hang him, Fred. He can't get away.
And you fell for it, Pete. It frightens me what I'd like to do to you.  Who else knows about this?
We got to think fast before those lying reporters get hold of this. What'll we tell 'em?
How would you like to have a job for three hundred and fifty dollars a month. That's almost a hundred dollars a week!
If we didn't have election Tuesday I'd have this on my conscience.
I was only doing my duty. Nothing personal in it.
That's good, Earl. Oh, they've got another alienist to see you. He ought to be here any minute. Don't go to sleep, will you?
Now, Hildy --
Now, Hildy, don't be hasty! I can't let him out.
What did you do with her?
All right, Judge.
I'll go right after it.
What's the matter? Getting yellow?
Yeah. I was never so tired in my life.
And up a dime.
First you got to sign a receipt.
Thanks. So long, Hildy!
What -- already? Why, the dame left only a minute before I did!
From all I can get the Sheriff let him out so's he could vote for him.
Don't move!
Let 'em take me. It's better that way.
We'll get you out in ten minutes.
Ssh!
Shut up, you!
Yes, I did, just now. Don't you remember?
No, I don't think so.
You're insane!
Hello, Mollie.
His Honor, the Mayor, now comes out with a statement that Earl Williams is a dangerous character in the employ of two or three foreign governments and the police are going to get him dead or alive. Somebody sends out a tip that this guy is hiding in Molly Malloy's joint. And this colored policeman, Daniels, goes over to pick Williams up. Williams has read the papers, thinks the cop is going to kill him and shoots first. That is all.
Put your hand on mine, get the knack of it.
I think you hit him, Grandpa. He was limping when he ran off.
No, you're out, Grandpa. It's my turn.
Looking for shrapnel.
Yes, you was. Make him talk.
I don't mind.
It's dinner time. It really is. Cross my heart.
The sodding water table.
We're not supposed to say, but we're being shipped out tomorrow.
...two Indians to fan me all night. The heat.
Weeds will grow, Mac.
You need trees for an avenue.
We didn't know that. It was a suicide mission. Machetes against artillery. Volunteers only.
That's it.
A clerk. I'm doing a typing course. I'll be typing for England.
I've had a letter from her. They've moved house.
Fair enough.  The river.
Half the time he's bluffing.
It's only a joke, Mummy. I'm fifteen. I'm still at school. I want to be a nun when I grow up.
Out.
It's not. It's happening to me.
Could we salt them, or smoke them, do you think?
Why? It's coming on its own. It doesn't hurt.
Wasn't it lovely?
And now we're glad you did.
Kids don't care. You're thinking of yourself.
Happy as can be. In the old groove.
Yeah, it won't take long and besides you sassy poodle girls will slow us down.
No, I told you...
Enjoy your last night...  ...where's Otis?
Go straight up about another mile... til we hit Cherrypicker Road and turn right... it ain't far from there.
Yeah, come on.
You sure do a lot of guessing.
You're welcome.
Whoopie fucking doo.
I was just wondering, cause you got a pissy look about you... like a real pussy licking bitch.
Yeah, I'll do something.
Now, what makes you think that?
Holy crap, thanks!
A missing girl. I use'ta go to school with her, she just up and disappeared some day... real weird.
How long is a piece of string? Too God damn long, that's how long.
I thought she tried to murder a witness for the prosecution.
Oh yeah, I heard about that. I always thought it was bullshit.
Whatever, at this point all I care about is food. I'm starving and I got a fucking killer headache.
Didn't look like chicken to me, more like fried pussy cat.
Jesus, you think she was really gonna cut you?
Man, it's already ten thirty.
We can't leave her out here in the rain... maybe we can just drop her at the next rest area.
What!
Whatever it is just do it. The more we play along the faster we'll get the hell out of here.
Well, ya can't complain I never take you anyplace.
Quiet.
Yeah, yeah, sure. You don't have to get all True Grit all over my ass... I'll give'm to ya... you can knock yourself silly for all I care.
Hmmmmm.
Yeah, I guess, you know next to wacking his weasel his other favorite thing is twisting sharpened pencils in the corner of his eyes.
Had to take him to the hospital. Kid had Dr. Zaius stuck half way up his butt, couldn't get it out.
That's nice.
How's he get around out here?
No dear, I'm fine. Now what kind of host would I be if I put my guests to this kind of work.
Oh.
I don't want to see that.
Oh yeah, murder museum... sounds fun.
Hey, listen to this... I think this is related to our Dr. Satan.
Yeah, in this book there's a chapter called Self Made Freaks about how people would mutilate themselves in order to work in a freak show. It mostly talks about tattooed people and wild men of Borneo and shit like that, but there is one mention of a single case where a woman was suspected of having her arms removed on purpose to become an arm-less wonder.
It says, "records show that Ellie Thompson was born in 1914 of normal physical stature and lived a life of normal bearings, until such time that she was placed in the care of the Willows State Mental Facility."
I don't...  ...I just thought it was weird.
When?
Help, help us.
Tell me about it.
Yeah, I hit burn out mode back at that old stripper lady's place. Watching her dance around with those ratty-looking animals was ridiculous.
Never. I swear to God he never sleeps, he goes to bed after me, wakes up before me. He's always working on 10.
She looks like she stinks.
I can't believe...
Yeah, she said we looked queer.
I don't know... about half an hour.
Shhhhhh, quiet.
I think I'm gonna have a fucking heart attack.
Yeah, no mercy here.
You find something, Georgie?
Huh?
His name is Rufus, Rufus Jr., but we all call him R.J.
No, just a little too old.
Don't worry, I'm gone.
This can't be real, this can't be real, this can't be real.
I appreciate your cooperation. I'm looking for a missing girl...  ...this girl here, Denise Willis... have you seen her?
Oh, alright... I guess I can trust you... being a man of the law and all.
Well, go get her.
George Willis...  ...any leads?
Fit the profile?
Where we headed?
Over here, inside the smokehouse.
Call Wydell.
Oh, yeah, you know about that? Hmmm, that's a strange one.
Right.
I always favored the Hulk.
Yeah, well I guess it's tough to sit on the sidelines and wait when your own kid's missing... besides, ain't no such thing as an ex-cop.
Let's hit the road, sooner we get a move on sooner we'll find her.
Right...  ...come on.
Excuse me for a second.
We found one.
No "buts." Go to your room now.
And think about what you've done.
How is that helping, Natalie? How exactly?
French?
Oui, doctor, oui.
Oui. Perfect!
Now I am truly embarrassed. Forgive me. I should not have asked such a stupid question. I know you are a very important man and...
I'm in my p.j.'s, too. Funny, huh?
Our...? Oh!  He seems fine. I guess we woke him. The lights and all.
When you were a little French girl?
Not in front of the boy.
Stop. Get away.
No! It is now that you must decide.  I love you, Doctor Nathan...  ...but I will not wait. I will not be your chippy. I will not be your little Mademoiselle Parlez-vous side dish.  My love. I want to have a sweet tiny baby inside my belly... from you.
You think too much. I need a man who doesn't think so much but acts more than he thinks... is what I need!
Okay.
Very well.
But I like being human now.
We bury the body. We disappear into the woods. Nobody knows.
I love it, Rose. I'm getting to be a real girl.
Tell me. I could use someone up my alley.
Won't he be able to tell?
I really like him, Rose. He's so...  ...passionate about his work.
Marrying a midget was a cheap thrill?
Please, honey, let me in.
Oh, Rosie.
Shut up, you.
I'm really glad you two found each other.
That's not necessarily a bad thing.
I'm not sure we can escape our natures. Believe me I've tried. I'm not even so sure anymore that we should want to.
You look wonderful. I'm on top of the world tonight, Lila. Work is going splendidly and my personal life is ...
Tell her, Harold...  It's just that... It's nothing. It's just that the outside fork is the salad fork. One goes from the outside in as the dinner progresses.
It's only that I really enjoy your company and...
I like you, too, Nathan.
Yes.
Absolutely.
What?
Nothing. Be right out.
I have to think! I have to think!
You are an animal.
No.
I'm just preoccupied.
Yeah. It's nice. It's really good.
...the back door of a movie theater. Yes, indeed.
I guess.
How come?
Absolutely!
Yeah. Puff and I got into a big, philosophical discussion. He's really quite well read, considering he's only been literate for a month now. He's going to make us famous, Lila.
Shit.
I'm loving this. It's such a treat to be out and about. What a wonderful invention a city is. The immense buildings of glass and steel glinting in the afternoon sun, the smartly dressed women in their best summer frocks, the colorful street vendors.
Lila?
It's wonderful! Do you think I'm ready? Do you really?
Now, my diminutive friend, what can I do for you?
Yes, I suppose so. I suppose I knew that was going to be what you would say. It's good to see you again though.
I'm in the book, if you ever want to drop me a line or something.
Yep.
I've never been to Louisville.
You know what's good for him?
For whom and for what?
Listen, Miss Ladybird, you're here on a rain check and I know it. You're hanging on by your nails. You let that glory whistle blow loud and clear for Eddie and you're a wreck on a railroad track. You're a horse that finished last. So don't make trouble, Miss Ladybird. Live and let live. While you can.
Well, Mr. Felson, maybe you could come out to my place some evening. We could play a few games of billiards.
You ever played billiards before?
The name's Gordon. Bert Gordon.
What did he say?
Cut.
What is?
So I got talent. So what beat me?
Okay, okay... What do I do now, lie down on the floor and, uh, bow from the ankles? What do I do, go home?
So I stay. Stay until I hustle up enough to play Fats again. Maybe by that time I'll develop myself some character.
I told you. I got drunk.
Why?
Oh yeah, I figured that. How much?
That's a -- that's a pretty big slice. Who do you think you are, General Motors?
Like I told ya. My thumbs.
How good is he?
It's all right. She had a little too much to drink, that's all. Forget it.  Go upstairs and sleep it off.
C'mon, Bert. Let me play him.
I don't know.
Level with me, Eddie. You ever play billiards before?
How're the hands?
Well, rack up your cue. We're leavin'.
I'm a businessman, kid.
Aaaahhhh!
No. Hell, no! You Eddie Felson?
What's your game? What do you shoot?
Look, friend, I'm not trying to hustle. I don't never hustle people that walk into poolrooms with leather satchels. Don't try to hustle me.
Oh, come on, stop stalling. Grab yourself a cue.
Luck! Whaddya mean, luck?
Let's get back on the road. You gotta be at that convention in the morning.
Yeah, like a church. Church of the Good Hustler.
Okay... Okay. Nobody can beat you.
Charlie, I'm gonna take him.
Approximately? One thousand bucks.
Now wait a minute. You're coming with me. You're gonna eat breakfast at the hotel. Pool game is over.
Eddie...
Hello, Eddie's girl...  I looked all over for you.
Oh, don't play it small, Charlie. It don't look good on you.
So am I... Sit down.  Would you get us a couple of drinks?
Aah! I've got no stomach for that any more. I've had that kind of life.
I told you you'd get your money back.
Don't worry about it. I'll raise the money.
What's the difference where? I'll raise it.  Is it all right if I have another drink?
My twenty-five per cent. Approximately fifteen hundred bucks.
What for? To play Fats again?
Is that what you think?
You're very direct, Mr. Felson.
Would you like to come out tonight?
Oh no, nothing for me.
Oh yeah, yeah. You're tired.  And beat.
A dollar on the five, two on the nine.
Let's cut out the small stuff, huh? Hundred dollar freeze-out. Ten games, ten bucks a game, winner take all. And then we'll see who quits.
I don't rattle, kid. But just for that I'm gonna beat you flat.
Yes.
Fine, thanks.
Eight o'clock.
Well, you're right. I guess it wouldn't.
Thanks. I will.
What did you say that for, Sarah?
You told me.
You want to go with me?
Mm hmm.
I'm getting treatments right here.
It's a machine gun. This guy told me when I came to the big city I'd have to have a machine gun, so I bought one.  Where do you get the money? To pay for all this? I mean the liquor, and the groceries, and the rent?
No, stick around.  Can I get you something? Drink? Coffee?
Me. It's Eddie.
I got beat up. They...  They broke my thumbs.
What does he do, this Bert Gordon?
Does it bother you? What he said?
You're not a loser, Eddie. You're a winner. Some men never get to feel that way about anything. I love you, Eddie.
Yes, I need them very much. And if you ever say them I'll never let you take them back.
Two.  Sherry?... Nice joint. You look very pretty.
Nothin'.  Want another drink?
Oh, I don't know.
I'd know it, Eddie. I'd know. For God's sakes, what are you trying to do to me? I love you.
Why?
Doesn't all of this come through to you, Eddie? Doesn't any of this mean anything to you? That man, this place, the people. They wear masks, Eddie. And underneath the masks they're perverted, twisted, crippled.
That's right.
Yeah. That's right, too.
Mm hm... Two ball, side pocket.
You know I gotta hunch, fat man. I gotta hunch it's me from here on in... One ball, corner pocket.  I mean, that ever happen to you? When all of a sudden you feel like you can't miss? I dreamed about this game, fat man. I dreamed about this game every night on the road... five ball...  You know, this is my table, man. I own it.
Preacher! Go on down and get me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown. No ice, no glass.
Game's over, Eddie.
Preacher, gimme my coat, will ya?
Listen to me, my blood somehow... helped you.  It could help all of you.  We could find some way to --
What do you mean?
Busy.  I went swimming and prepared a new vehicle.  A big vehicle.
Stay alive.
I guess you could say that.
Round back.
I'll have to go to a new school -- again.
This can be your room if you want it. What do you say?
It's got a name.  Copper Ridge. There used to be a copper mine near here.
And that one -- to the right of Rigel?
Okay.
You've got to come see -- a big thing went down over the hill!
I don't know, Dad.  But it was big.
It was all made of stuff that's happened to you in the last few days.  The sand pit in back of the house, and the meteor shower, and meeting your teacher and the colonel at school, and being afraid of the new kids because you don't know them ...
Why, yes.  Why?
May I ask why?
Yes ... yes, but I'm not sure what I saw anymore.
What happened to your other slipper?
What? -- I...
We're going with you. I mean, we're going too.
If we do, we'll both die virgins. But at last we'll be together.
You don't understand. You have to leave Washington.
I've worked with embedded loading. They're communicating with a hidden signal. They're going to attack...
He's not going to listen to me.
Did it work?
Punched the President? Oh my god.
Remember I told you that the signal hidden within our satellite signal is slowly recycling down to extinction.
Dad, don't start.
You want to borrow the car? You don't have a license.
It's perfect the line is busy?
He wasn't the President then.
Looks like they're preparing the invasion.
Doesn't matter. Game's over.
She should be shortly.
Better than we thought.
Then find them.
That's not your call to make, Mr. Nimziki.
My God, the Vice President and the Joint Chiefs...
It had been deemed classified.
No Sir. Definitely not.
No. Exotic.
I thought you didn't recognize me.
You sure?
We must maintain a working government in a time of crisis...
The other bombers might have more luck. We shouldn't just give up...
Not all too dissimilar to us. Breathes oxygen, comparable tolerances to heat, cold... probably why they're interested in our planet.  Hey, you wanna see them?
There is no museum in Iskenderun.
The dog!?  You are named after the dog...
Yes. My treat.
It's today's mail. And it's been opened.
It looks like a converted church.
I maintain an apartment in Venice, at your disposal.
How dare he?!
The Holy Grail, Doctor Jones. The chalice used by Christ during the Last Supper. The cup that caught His blood at the Crucifixion and was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea.
Every man's dream.  Including your father's, I believe.
I've heard this one as well. Two of these brothers walked out of the desert one hundred and fifty years after having found the Grail and began the long journey back to France. But only one of them made it. And before dying of extreme old age, he supposedly imparted his tale to a -- to a Franciscan friar, I think.
We're through!
Lower me down.
He never would have made it past the rats! He hates rats! He's scared to death of them!
Mine, too.
Oh, yes. Give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere.
How do you know?
I'm like a bad penny. I always turn up.
Junior!
And the head.  You hit me, Dad!
Yeah, big ones. What do the Nazis want with you Dad?
Well, uh...
Umh?
My lucky charm.
Try and burn through the ropes.
What?
I'm out, Dad!
What about the boat? We're not going on the boat?
Brody's this way.
What final challenge?
Booby traps?
Half the German Army's on our tail and you want me to go to Berlin? Into the lion's den?
What about Marcus?
Hmmm... What did we talk about?
Actually, I was a wonderful father.
Then what are you complaining about?  Look, we have work to do. When we get to Alexandretta we will face three challenges.  "First, the breath of God. Only the penitent man will pass. Second, the Word of God, only in the footsteps of God will he proceed. Third, the Path of God, only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth."
Dad, we're well out of range.
Who cares? As long as they're keeping Donovan busy. Dad, you stay here while Sallah and I organize some transportation.
You call this archaeology?
Junior...
After you, Junior.
What happened to Marcus, Sallah?
But, Indy --
Because you're looking for the Holy Grail.
No.
No, Doctor Jones. It's yours!
The secret of the Grail has been safe for a thousand years. And for all that time the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword has been prepared to do anything to keep it safe.
It's some kind of cult! And they've got the sacred stones that Indy was searching for.
I remember first hearing your name when I was studying at Oxford. I am Chattar Lal, Prime Minister for His Highness the Maharajah of Pankot.
No, no, that is Uhmed Singh, the present Maharajah's late father.
Lost? No, we're not lost. We're on our way to Delhi. This is Miss Scott -- and Mr. Round. My name's Indiana Jones.
Dr. Jones, we are all vulnerable to vicious rumors. I seem to remember that in Honduras you were accused of being a grave robber rather than a scientist.
Yes, I understand.
At last I have the ashes of my sacred ancestor!
Sure, Indy -- three tickets! You, me and Wu Han --
That's it. Pankot Palace.
Okay, Shorty... see you in the morning... I'm going to have a little -- word with Willie.
Why they glow like that?
Nobody can say you don't have a vivid imagination.
Mola Ram -- you're about to meet Kali -- in Hell!
You're betrayed Shiva.
I don't understand. What's happened here?
Long ago -- before my father's father.
Poison never agrees with me.  Pull a right, Short Round, and head for the Wang Poo bridge!
Oh yeah?
Their children?
It was destined that I came here -- and the future cannot be changed...
Don't worry, I'm coming in! What is it?
PET IT??!!
It's starting to let go!
Oh, that's easy -- I'm going to latch onto a good-looking, incredibly rich prince.
You want me so bad, why don't you invite me?
Don't catch cold.
You know, Willie, I'll bet he's mad because they were eating his friends for dinner.
Willie, open the door! GET US OUT OF HERE!
I can't find any lever! Help me Indy!
There's got to be another way out.
It wasn't him.
Yes?
...I need to make a phone call.
Where are we now?
I'm working on it. Soon as I find the right nerve bundle.
What are you doing in my head, Al?
That a new Datsun?
Kill myself.
Used to be, things were bad. No job...no money...no girl. Now I got all that and I'm crazy too.
Yes...Yes...I'll explain it all. Just put the gun down.
Sorry...all this...buzzing in my head.  Why don't I just take you back to UST?
He's not the problem. It's the van in the back.
Then what are you stopping for?
Can't see a Goddamn thi..
Too late...They want you.
How do you act when someone trys to kill you?
I am. You are.
What does it say.
You do. To get out of here. You're gonna be me.
You can't go home. When UST finds we're gone, they'll come after you and put us away.
Who cares?
The beach.
Follow it.
Rene...
What's nothing look like? ...it looks like nothing.
This...is not going to work out.
Who, me?
Just hold them close and stay still.
I don't know what's going on.
My coast is Maine, actually. We have a place in Bar Harbor...And a bar in Sutton Place.
...I've lost something. I must get it back.
How do you know?
Your data must be bad. Everyone can't be lying all the time.
What am I supposed to do?
Joe! It's 56 hours!
I don't know!
It's not your time. I get time off.
You found her.
That's good. It's not better. Where?
Osaka?
We are trying to stand out. Right near his address. Easier to get them to come to us, than to try and find them. ..now keep your eyes open, something might present itself.
Run, stupid!
Just stay here and rest.
Too late.
Drink lots of water.
Trying to analyze this stuff. Now...go to the medicine shelf and take ---- and ----.
Not sure at all.
GRUNER switched the chip to him, not from him, then he led us away again...to Chiang Cho.
And don't let her know, either.
Well, don't let it. What are you doing?
What exactly?
Rene?
Thing is...I think I'm in love with her.
Yeah, sure.
You're lovely.
I'll get us out of here.
RYUJI Bandaio. Grown near here.
Aren't we all.
What part what?
I insist.
I know we fight, but I don't mean it. You're quite a guy. No one else could have dealt with this.
Trouble...is, if we both get stuck here.
I dyed it. We're all getting old.
Surveilliance on them all.
He work for us?
Yes. Joe.
You remind me of someone. You from the west coast?
I think I've heard of you.
Do what?
How do I look?
Oh.
Oh....Sure.
I will?
Not you. Them.
Much better now, thank you. Just sit here quietly...see there's nothing to worry about...just be my old self again....soon...
Yessir...very good sir.
What's what?
Yes, of course.
Disinterest?
You are.
What do you mean?
They kidded me a little.
Sometimes. I told you I did.
No, he didn't do that.
No.
Lots of my clients are rich guys... They like danger..like playing with drugs and things...running around, acting mysterious.
It was a good job. Not many ways for a foreigner to make money here. Ryuji hires me to organize business meetings...take care of things.
I can't fly it.
Yes. No. I'm...okay. They can't do this. They can't hold us here.
It was my choice.
I'll come back for you.
We're not moving fast enough for him.
...Piece of mind.
Why not?
What does he know?
Whoever took it does.
For reading.
What's that outside, Daddy?
Yes, baby?
Lowell?
You got a deal.
Monday.
It's drawn from a selectively circulated...
I'll take a look at what you got. But I'm not moving any deadlines 'cause you say so.
...if you are, then I'll take Barbara to soccer and take you to dance after...
Well, what do you think I'm going to do? Quit in protest? I'm not going to do that.
No. I'm not going to take "no" for an answer. No.
What does it look like I'm doing? I'm editing.
Yes, I'm afraid I did.
What about you, you got a crew already?
Okay.
How grave?
They own the information he's disclosing. The truer it is, the greater the damage to them. If he lied, he didn't disclose their information. And the damages are smaller.
How are you, Jim?
Oh, c'mon, Lowell. This is The New York Times. I don't know...
Jim, it's Lowell.
I'm doing an interview.
Did you say Berman?
Will he go on-camera and talk about the Mexico City branch?
Hello? Yeah...
I can't... I've got to fly to Boston tomorrow.
..."ignition propensity?"  ...you understand any of this...?
They're killing the Wigand interview...
Jeffrey...
So, it's a big country with a free press. You can go work somewhere else.
Alright.
I'll call you then.
You eating with us?
Hardly new news.
How are the rooms? Comfortable?
Do you think we could talk about the taping? Tomorrow's taping, just so we can get it out of the way and order...
Good.
I took off on Tisch. I took off on corporate. They'll know they're not going to see everything on Sunday night...
Do me a favor, will you? Spare me, for God's sake. Get in the real world. What do you think? I'm going to resign in protest? To force it on the air? The answer is "no." I don't plan to spend the end of my days wandering in the wilderness of National Public Radio.  That decision I've already made.
Alright. What did you think?
I'm going to tell you why. Because when I tell someone I'm going to do something, I deliver.
Oh, please, Mike...
You and I have been doing this together for fourteen years.
Yeah... Thank you.
What I've seen... I've liked.
No. We don't do that.  You've seen "60 Minutes" and Mike Wallace. So you know our reputation for integrity and objectivity. You also know we are the highest-rated, most-respected, TV-magazine news show in America.
Black, black...
What are you talking about? Where are you?
I did not burn you. I did not give you up to anyone!
The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... they got up in front of Congress that time... it was on television...
Then... you're in a state of conflict, Jeff.
Tempura...
You charge by the hour?
Well, my father left us when I was five-years old. He was not the most ingenious man I ever knew... Let's get back to Brown & Williamson. If you decide to go on "60 Minutes," I got to know everything about why you got fired.
...to a network, probably, we're all commodities.  To me? You are not a commodity. What you are is important.
Maybe that's just what you've been telling yourself all these years to justify having a good job? Having status? And maybe for the audience, it's just voyeurism? Something to do on a Sunday night. And maybe it won't change a fucking thing. And people like myself and my family are left hung out to dry. Used up! Broke, alone!
They're terrorizing us. Death threats?! To my family? My kids?!
They do this with impunity!
...to talk about it. To think about it. I had a plan to ease her into it. But, I really -- I didn't know how to do that...
Run that Sandefur piece on "nicotine's not addictive." Run that on-camera. Then cut right to Wigand with "I believe they perjured..." Then go wide to the CEOs all taking the oath. Back on Jeff and play the pause after the word "felt" on the B-side...
What kind of shit is this? I was not on the team, I sparred with the Olympic Team... okay?
What does this have to do with my testimony?
And I've got to refute every fucking accusation made in this report before The Wall Street Journal runs.  I am trying to protect you, man!
You're breaking up. I can't hear you.
What?
For example. James Burke, the CEO of Johnson & Johnson... when he found out that some lunatic had put poison in Tylenol bottles, he didn't argue with the FDA... He didn't even wait for the FDA to tell him. He just pulled Tylenol off every shelf of every store right across America. Instantly. And then he developed the safety cap... Because, look, as a CEO, sure, he's gotta be a great businessman, right? But he's also a man of science. He's not going to allow his company... to put on the shelf... a product that might hurt people.  Not like the Seven Dwarfs...
Well, what do you really think, though?
Someone put a bullet in my mailbox.
Then hold it off the air until you got that. But I want to go to New York. And I want to go on the record. Right now!
There an echo in here? Your objection's been recorded. She typed it into her little machine over there. It's on the record. So now I'll proceed with my deposition of my witness. Does it act as a drug?
When should we do this?
Possibly, yes. That is one of the possible consequences of your testifying here today. That's right...
I'd rather play than talk about it.  What did you want to see me about? I don't like being back here.
Now, don't be paranoid, Jeff.  About the direction of research here, we may have had our differences of opinion...
Well, I wouldn't say --
They hate each other --
I told you we know each other, baby. Mr. Massey represented my ex-brother- in law. Martin Reiser?
Here. Got pictures.
She said "penetrate." Heh heh heh.
We'd better go before we get thrown out.
Well -- at the moment, that'd be me.
Who's the pigeon?
Shut up. I was a lawyer. Just like you. And my clients? Whores just like you.
Miles! Don't waste time with someone else's queen, either.
What?
Yes?
So, that's good, right?
Ruth Rabino.
Maybe they put a horse head in her bed?
I said yes.
And you must be Mr. Massey.
Not according to Mrs. Rabinow.
Isn't everything?
Have you ever been married, Miles?
And you've always loved him?
That is true, isn't it Miles? Your pre-nup is the best there is?
Miles. Miles. Miles.
Have you tried the duck?
Although knowing you as I do -- there will be no settlement. This time it will be complete and total annihilation.
I don't blame them for betraying me. I don't blame Rex, or Howard or my father. You see, Miles, I'm going to tell you something about me. Something you may or may not know. I suck!
No. Don't stop.
She didn't love you?
She held that against you?
Your mother was.
That is bullshit! Mine is a bitch and yours is a psycho. I can't believe you're saying this, Marylin! There's nothing wrong with us. We're attractive and charismatic and successful and... I like us.
I want this to be a marriage based on love, trust and community property. That's all I've ever wanted.
Well, I suppose I could "girly" it up for you with a little Fortuny, and some passementerie --
Fabric and fringe.
Miles.
I bet.
Can you Marylin? Can you return the trust? Can you return the hopes? The dreams? Can you just...  SEND IT ALL BACK FOR STORE CREDIT?
On the contrary. We're married and we have no pre-nup, so a case could be made that everything in here is mine.
The IRS? They owe me. I'm expecting a refund.
Now. But first, he worked for you.
Wait just a second there. You sent him here. You unearthed this pestilence.
Fine. They were created during a dictatorship.  What if something happened to you? What would I tell little Gus when he asked "what was my daddy like?"
Thank you, Mrs. Rexroth.
Like I know his intention? Or yours for that matter?  I should join Sam. I'm too old for this bullshit.
I wish I had your discipline.
Well what does he want?
He has a reputation for being tough.
They bought her speech. If I was only in it for Rex's money, he shouldn't have to give me any.
It's not Ming. It's Tong.
What about rugs? I thought we were stopping at Mansour?
Yes, yes, it's just -- you know I've never been the first wife. Rex was married before me.
He would invite these girls home from the staple factory to our condominium in Palm Springs. He had a device he called the Intruder.
Please! No calls! I'm feeling very fragile.
Oh, just a routine mammogram. She said to say hello. She's going to Positano with your brother's family.
My client is prepared to entertain an amicable dissolution of the marriage without prejudice.
She's YOUR wife. Why don't you ask her? Anyway, I assume she signed the highly over rated Massey pre-nup.
...why did she do it, Ruth? Why?
You know what I mean when I say "it."
Seems like there's more of it than ever before --
Video.
I am very sorry.
We wanted Ruth here for your protection as well --
Of course. Of course she was married. What else would she be? Single? I don't think so.
She's keeping his name. And one of his planes. And all seven of his children
What I'm asking isn't impossible. My daughter is somewhere between here and Miami. I want her found!
Whyuhshe's all right, sir.
Yeah.
Let me get this straight. You want this thirty-nine sixty in addition to the ten thousand dollars?
The reward.
I'm afraid I'm a little confused. You see, I assumed you were coming here for
You were taken for a buggy ride?
Please. I can't fight on an empty stomach. Remember what Napoleon said.
I'll get it annulled.
That was enough. Do you mind handing me the ketchup?
I won't thank you! I'll never thank you!
Sorry. Must have been day-dreaming.
Oh, no.
On the road.
He's marvelous!
It's no use, Dad. I practically threw myself at him.
Is that his name?
You haven't heard from him, have you, Dad?
Oh, please, Dad
I suppose so.
Yessir. She refuses them all.
It's not quite that simple.  I've dealt with prisoners in my time, but this one
Naturally.  You're going to become a partner in a big institution. It's one of the largest in the world.
Someday perhaps, you might even take charge.
Sock her!
I haven't the slightest idea.
What do they say?
But it's King Westley on the phone.
What happened to your money?
Just between you and me, I never intended taking it off.
Ohthe papers
Hey, whadda you tryin' to dokid me?
Now, that's a brilliant answer. Why didn't I think of it? Our conversation could have been over long ago.
Holy Smokes! You'll never get out yourself! Better phone for some help.
Yeah. I knew you'd catch on eventually.
You can wire home for some money when we get to Jacksonville.
Why, you ungrateful brat!
Yes.
I hated to wake you up.  How about some breakfast?
I kind of half expected you to thank me.
Oh, this?I like privacy when I retire. I'm very delicate in that respect. Prying eyes annoy me.  Behold the walls of Jericho![4] Maybe not as thick as the ones that Joshua blew down with his trumpet, but a lot safer. You see, I have no trumpet.  Now just to show you my heart's in the right place, I'll give you my best pair of pajamas.
Hurry up and get dressed.
If you didn't waste so much time on that wise-cracking drummerwe'd have been through with breakfast by this time.
One consolation; you can never be lonesome.
Santa Claus?
Oh. Is that how you met him?
Say, where did you learn to dunk, in finishing school?
Of course you shouldn't. You don't know how to do it. Dunking's an art. Don't let it soak so long. A dip and plop, into your mouth. If you let it soak so long, it'll get soft and fall off. It's all a matter of timing. I ought to write a book about it.
Just goes to show you. Twenty millions and you don't know how to dunk.
What are you talking about?
Next week "East Lynne."
Don't be silly. Nothing you can do. Must be tough on an old womana trip like this.
At the rate he started, he's probably passed two state lines by this time. The exercise is good for him.
To New York?
No.
Try me.
Raw?
Clever.
Mind your own business.
Come on! come on!
Darling!
Yeah. He finally agreed to let us have a room.
Goodnight, Mr. Warne.
Come here, you little fool!
Not interested.
When does the bus leave?
Husband?
Isn't he here?
Serves you right. Oughta be careful who you take up with on the road. You can't go plyin' your trade in my camp.
You ain't gonna stick me for no phone calls. You can go down to the Sheriff's office.
Believe you me, you bore me to distraction.
What's that?
What time is it?
What's 'at?
Huh?
That's okay by me! 'Cause as far as I'm concerned, I'm through with newspapers! See? I'm through with stupidity! I'll never write another newspaper story, for you or anybody else, if I have to starve.  Yeah? What about my novel! When I get through with that
You mean about the Andrews' kid?
I am, Joe.
Yeah.
For heaven's sake, Joestop being an editor for just a minute.  We've been friends for a long time, haven't we? You ought to know when I'm serious. This is on the level.
Well, I'll be
ain't got a hat
Yeah.
Blamed if I know. I just brung 'em a trumpet.
Yeah. You know, one of those toy things. They sent me to the store to get it.
Collect?
He looked like an upright young feller to me, Ma.
Better start gettin' into your clothes.
There's a seat over there for you.
Come on, scram! And stay away from that bus.
The interesting thing is the extent to which the Warren Commission went to make him a Communist.  They got almost 150 pages and 130 exhibits of the report on this Mexico trip and the picture doesn't even match.  I'm beginning to think the point of the Mexican episode was to lay the blame at Castro's door.  If Oswald, or someone purporting to be Oswald, had gotten into Cuba, come back, then killed the President, the American public once again would've screamed for a Cuban invasion...
"Threat to assassinate President Kennedy in Dallas, Texas, November 22-23.  Information received by the Bureau has determined that a militant revolutionary group may attempt to assassinate President Kennedy on his proposed trip to Dallas, Texas, etc, etc..."
Because you keep conning me, Dean. I read your testimony to the Warren Commission and...
Oh, I first heard these street cats jiving about him back in '56, '57 when I lived down in the Quarter.
Like I told to the Washington boys, Bertrand called that summer and asked me to help the kid upgrade his Marine discharge...
Goddammit chief, why would I ever need to look in your files?  I saw enough here this summer to write a book.
You know what I mean.  I saw a lot of strange things going on in this office this summer.  And a lotta strange people.
Hey, where y'at, Frank?  You're wasting your time here.  Big Jim gave strict orders.  No FBI allowed.
Boss would fry me in hog fat if he knew...
No, I'm not...
Pretty flowery for Dave Ferrie.
Keep saying what?
Who is he, Joe?  I've been to every bar, no one wants to talk.
Twenty dollars each time.  Hell, it's no secret.  That's what I'm here for.
No, you're awake, Bill, and I'm dead serious.  And we're going to start by tracking down your anonymous source from three years ago.  How did you find out Dave Ferrie drove to Texas that day?
Does that bother you, Bill?  I always wondered in court why it is because a woman is a prostitute, she has to have bad eyesight.
When something's rotten in the land, Bill, it generally isn't just one fish, we'll get corroboration... find this Clay Bertrand.  If I were a betting man, I'd give you 10 to 1 it's an alias.  Start checking around the Quarter.
Let's start making some assumptions about the man.  Why would he leave a path as big as Lee Harvey Oswald's? This is not a thin trail, gentlemen, it is a very wide one.  Who found the evidence?  Who set him up?  Lou, Bill, Susie, I want you to go back and check all the sightings of Oswald in Dallas, New Orleans and Mexico in the summer and fall of '63 - see if it's the same guy.
So for those reasons, you're going to trial against Clay Shaw, chief? Well, you're gonna lose!  We should be investigating all our Mafia leads here in New Orleans - Carlos Marcello, Santos Trafficante - I can buy that a hell of a lot easier than the Government.  Ruby's all Mob, knows Oswald, sets him up.  Hoffa - Trafficante - Marcello, they hire some guns and they do Kennedy and maybe the Government doesn't want to open up a whole can o'worms there because it used the Mob to get to Castro.  Y'know, Castro being assassinated sounds pretty wild to John Q.  Citizen.  So they close the book on J.F.K.  It makes sense to me.
No, I would not even know what he looked like except for the pictures I've been shown.
No, I did not.
Dave, do you think we're out of our minds?  The whole building's been a zoo since that broke.  We can't get a thing done.  Reporters crawling everywhere.  You think we want that?
What did they...
Dave, you know that's where this road leads.
Yeah.  Come on, Dave, come on our side.  I guarantee you the boss'll protect you...  Dave?
They're Agency, too.  Don't you get it?  CIA and Mafia together.  Trying to whack out the Beard.  Mutual interests.  They been doing it for years.  There's more to this than you dream.  FBI fucking hates the CIA.  Navy Intelligence got something to do with it too.  Check out "Alan Pope" in Miami.  Jack Youngblood. Bill Harvey.  Colonel Roselli.  The shooter, I hear, was a Dallas cop - the bagman at Ruby's club.  I heard he shot his own partner.  Got that? Check out the rich fucks in Dallas. H.L. Hunt.  He's dirty.  That's all I know.  But the Agency always runs the show.  Check out something called "Mongoose"  Operation Mongoose. Government, Pentagon stuff, they're in charge, but who the fuck pulls whose chain who the fuck knows, fun 'n' games man - check out Southeast Asia - that's the next big number - the heroin trail.  "Oh, what a deadly web we weave when we practice to deceive."
Did you bag any geese on this trip?
Your young friends also told us you had no weapons in the car.  Dave, isn't it a bit difficult to hunt for geese without a shotgun?
I see.  Dave thank you for your time.  I'm sorry it has to end inconveniently for you, but I'm going to have you detained for further questioning by the FBI.
Dave, I find your story simply not believable.
Dave, it's going to be okay.  Just talk to us on the record and we'll protect you.  I guarantee it.
Get some rest, Dave, and you'll feel better in the morning.  We'll talk then.
I had the cause of death.
Well I heard Dr. Humes stating that - he said...
What?
If that's your case, you didn't have a case.  I wouldn't believe whatever Habighorst said, anyway.
That's something, Jasper.  What is it?
Hi, Freckle Face.
Well if they can kill the President, they can certainly get me.
That's impossible.  You heard echoes ...echoes.  We have three bullets and three shots which came from the Book Depository and that's all we're willing to say.
None!  The State Department issues him a new passport in 48 hours and loans him the money to travel.  He's never investigated or charged by the Navy for revealing classified information or, as far as we know, debriefed by the CIA.
No, I don't think I am, Susie.  Anyone else?
I know.
David Ferrie.
Naturally.  Are you claiming, Mr. Garrison, that Mr. Oswald also had dinner with me?
I've spent half my life in the United States military serving and defending this great country, Mr. Shaw, and you're the first person I ever met who considered it an act of patriotism to kill his own president.
Mmmmm... sure smells good... but Egghead, do you realize Oswald was interrogated for twelve hours after the assassination, with no lawyer present, and nobody recorded a word of it?  I can't believe it.  A police captain with 30 years experience and a crowd of Federal agents just had to know that with no record anything that Oswald said would be inadmissible in court.
You know I don't like these tribal rituals, Freckle Face.  I'm interviewing Clay Shaw this morning.
Liz, I'm really sorry.  The meeting went much longer than expected.
I don't know what to say except I'm sorry.  I just don't have rabbits on my mind.
I don't know what to tell them.  How 'bout the truth - I'm doing my job to make sure they can grow up in a country where justice won't be an arcane, vanished idea they read about in history books, like the dinosaurs or the lost continent of Atlantis.
You and your government!  What's the matter with you?  Don't you have any feelings?  Your daughter!  What kind of man are you?
I don't want to see, goddammit!  I'm tired.  I've had enough!  They say you don't have anything anyway! Everybody in town's talking.  You're ruining this man Shaw's life!  You're attacking him because he's homosexual! Going ahead with this stupid "trial"! Did you ever once stop and consider what he's going through?
Upstairs.  In 1963 that was the Office of Naval Intelligence - And just by coincidence, Banister, before he was FBI, was ONI.  What do they say?
Graveyard dead near Big Sandy, Texas in '65.  Two in the morning on some highway.  A hit and run.
And it ain't pretty  ..."the AD has spent more than $8,000 on unexplained travel and investigative expenses since November, 1966.
No.
Russell, honestly you sound like one of those kooky critics spreading paranoia like prairie fire.  I just can't believe the Chief Justice of the United States would put his name on something that wasn't true.
Well, if I am, why is the Government concealing evidence?
I've already been warned by the Agency, Mr. Whoever.  If this is another type of threat, I don't...
But you don't have a choice anymore. You've become a significant threat to the national security structure. They would've killed you already, but you got a lot of light on you. Instead, they're gonna destroy your credibility; they already have in many circles in this town.  You're some kinda ego-crazed southern caricature to many folks.  Be honest - the best chance you got is come up with a case, something, anything, make arrests, stir the shitstorm. You gotta hope to reach a point of critical mass where other people will come forward and the government will crack.  Remember, fundamentally people are suckers for the truth, and the truth is on your side, 'bubba. I hope you get a break...
You didn't get that break you needed, but you went as far as any man could, bubba.  What can I do for you?
...and your General?
His name?
More than ten years.
I don't know if I should talk about this.
And Oswald?
There was one guy, I don't know, big guy, business guy, white hair - I saw him come into the office once. He looked out of place, y'know - like a society guy.  Can't remember his name.  Oswald was with him.
Nobody knows what we're talking about, Jack.
Even your own wife, Numa.  Any of you want to quit, do me a favor... put us out of our misery.
I expected that two months ago, and they're wasting their time... The bad news is the National Guard has just asked me to resign after 18 years.  Well, maybe that's good news - it was never as good as combat, but this is.  Bill, any more on Oswald and Shaw?
Yes, thank you, Mr. Garrison.  Your coffee's almost Turkish down here but I could get used to it.
If you must know, virtually nothing.
Yes.
Well, the public attention it would attract.  And we have no place for you there to be safe, we're not law enforcement officials, and many things are at stake in this affair, Mr. Ruby.
Yes, you have a suit I've had my eye on.
I went. I did. I took my mother and little brother.
Sure, 'cause I didn't ask her if I could go.
I understand.
I'll call her.
Well, it ain't so much a problem a a situation. Remember I sold those three M-60 machine guns outta the five I got?
I'm gonna sell the other two tonight. This group of Koreans in Koreatown have started a Neighborhood Watch kinda thing. And they want a few weapons so the neighborhood niggas know they mean business. So I'm gonna sell 'em my two machine guns tonight. Only problem, I ain't never dealt with these Koreans before. Now I ain't worried. Asians are by and large real dependable. They don't want no trouble. You might argue about price, but you ain't gotta worry about them shootin' you in the back. But I got me kind of a rule. Never do business with nobody you ain't never done business with before without backup. That's why I need you, backup.
I found out.
I told Jackie, and Jackie said you wanted him.
That looks like fifty thousand dollars from here.
She wants to go back to work.
The usual things. I'm a flight attendant with Cabo Air.
This is Special Agent Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. Would you mind if we looked in that bag?
You have the right to say "no." And I have the right to make you wait here with Ray while I go get a warrant. And if I don't want to go through all that trouble, I could just take you in on suspicion.
If I were to tell you "no it isn't..."
While you're at it, let me see what else is in there. You mind?
That's my diet shit.
'Course I do -- I deliver money for him.
Can you do it or not?
It's okay. It's a cop hangout.
I am, as a matter of fact.
Sure.
I had 'em too. I burnt those two Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down. Then their asses lucked out and found that coke.
That's him. How do you know 'em?
Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
How many trips did you make?
You went out this morning and bought a gun?
It looks nice.
'74, I think.
What I meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you.
He called you?
What?... What'd you do?
No thanks. There's gotta be other ways to get it out.
I'm fine with it, or I wouldn't of done it, I did it to feel better about myself, and I do. When I look in the mirror it looks like me.
Well, I'd never be so bold as to speak for all men, but as or myself and a few of my friends, that's definitely the case. There's a lot of actresses out there you like, and there's some you have crushes on. But there's always one who you love. And with her it's sorta like going steady.
Right around here, in the food court.
If I saw a way to walk off with a shopping bag full of money, would I take it?
When did you decide?
Wait a minute. After we were together you went and snuck into a guy's house?
And went to this guy's house in El Monte, and I waited for him.
Shoot him with the stun gun. While he's incapacitated, cuff him, take 'em to County.
Which one?
He won't -- I mean, he didn't the last time. He'll be expecting fifty thousand and there it is -- on top.
Well, a suit. There's one I had my eye on.
People talk to Winston. He's street, same as them, they trust him. They get busted, they know somebody who can bond them out. I thought I might drop in on him. He'll no doubt be surprised to see me.
It's not that simple.
Tell him you want to see him?
What do you tell Nicolet?
Did you tell him you were leaving?
Well, that's the State's offer. If you plead to possession and tell L.A.P.D. what they want to know, your bond will be set at one-thousand dollars. If you don't, L.A.P.D. will request one at twenty-five thousand based on your prior record and risk of flight. If you don't post it or don't know anyone who can, you'll spend six to eight weeks in County before your arraignment comes up.
Do you live together?
What the fuck is that shit?
Can I smoke?
No.
You two meet?
You talk to him?
But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
After all, it don't belong to nobody, right?
I'm glad you realize that. Saves me the trouble of pointing it out to you.  Put this in your shopping bag. It's what I expect to find when I look in Sheronda's. Comprende?
But you didn't do that.
It's possible. You're saying you don't have any idea what happened to that fifty thousand?
He told me to go outside.  "You may leave us now." It's all part of his pathetic attempt to be "the man." You know Mr. Walker don't you?
Kinda.
Hey, you get caught with blow, that's your business.
I said I wanted to talk to a lawyer.
I didn't tell 'em anything.
Go sit over in that chair.
One hundred thousand put in an escrow account in my name, if I'm convicted up to a year, or put on probation. If I have to do more than a year, you pay another hundred thousand.
All your money's in Mexico.
I been thinkin about that, too, and I got me a idea.
I don't think so, but it don't really matter. They know I'm meeting you.
I told them.
They already know it's you.
They know I'm delivering for you. I mention the half-million -- they don't give a fuck about that -- They want you with guns. So I say, well, if you want proof he's getting paid for selling them, let me bring the money in.
Who?
A woman.
Yeah, I think a woman.
But you don't?
I'll give ya ten.
Uh-huh.
I ain't gonna send no roc whore. The woman's cool, I promise.
How do you know she did that?
Now, hold on there. I ain't pullin' no shit. It's my money, I can do whatever the fuck I wanna do with it.
She don't know shit about the money.
I told her this is a game us rich folks play, exchanging gifts. Like a scavenger hunt. She didn't know what that was neither.  No answer?
The fitting room. There's a sign over the door.
Ray, the A.T.F. guy.
Sure.
Uh-huh.
The roller disco one.
The beach. Or get high, drop acid at a friend's place. I was a K.L.O.S. girl. I hated disco.
No.
I don't like dancing.
I wouldn't go so far as to say that.
Uh-huh?
We shoulda been there already and we woulda been if it hadn't been for your fuckin' around!
I'm getting out of here. What do you think?
Then what?
Which one is for the car?
Okay.
Oh, I dunno. Watching TV.
Nothin' really. Just kinda goin' back and forth. They had some black girl from some black show on Jay Leno. I watched that for a bit, but I kept flippin channels cause I didn't know who she was.
C'mon in.
He put himself in a situation where he was gonna have to do ten years in the penetentiary, that's what he did.  And if you know Beaumont, you know there ain't no way in hell he can do no ten years. And if you know that, you know Beaumont's gonna go any goddam thing Beaumont can to keep from doin' those ten years including telling the Federal government everything they want to know about my ass. Now that, my friend, is a clear case of him or me. And you best believe it ain't gonna be me. You know what I'm sayin'? You gonna come in on this with me, you gotta be prepared to go all the way. I got me so far over a half-a-million dollars sittin' in lockboxes in a bank in Cabo San Lucas. Me and Mr. Walker make us one more delivery, I'm gonna have me over a million. You think I'm gonna let this little cheese eatin' nigga here fuck that up? Shit, you better think again. 'Fore I let this deal get fucked up, I'll shoot that nigga in the head, and ten niggas look just like em.  Understand what I'm sayin'?
Hell, yeah. To her dumb country ass, Compton is Hollywood. Close as she's ever been, anyway.
Yep.
I told you, man.  She my fine little surfer gal.
Twice. In the parking lot.
You said five hundred and fifty!
Maybe the Feds got it.
I don't know. Either she has it or the Feds.
Tell me.
Oh, you gonna tell me the reason you lost all the goddam money I got in the world! Let me tell you the reason, motherfucker! The reason is, your ass ain't worth a shit no more!
Have fun.
Cops can't locate him, huh?
Sure thing. I don't have to know what I'm doing, long as you know.
Gonna have to put up cash.
Fella named Beaumont. They have him up at county. It started out drunk driving, but they wrote it up "possession of a concealed weapon." Dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him.
They fuckin' wit' her. They callin' it Possession with Intent. A black woman in her forties gets busted with less than two ounces on her, they call that shit Intent. Same shit happened to a movie star. It's Possession.
She had, I believe it was... fifty grand on her, too. There was a cop at the hearing. Young guy with L.A.P.D. wanted her bond set at twenty- five thousand, saying there was a risk of flight. Jackie being a stewardess and all.
What does she do for you?
Cause you want me to know what a slick guy you are. You got stewardesses bringing you fifty grand.
Is white guilt supposed to make me forget I'm running a business?
Looky here, I know you helped her and I know you know what I want. Jackie can tell me any story come in that pretty head of hers. Long as at the end of that story, she hands over my money. She do that, we're still friends. Now, she don't wanna be my friend no more, tell her to think about ol' Louis. And if she tries to turn me in, I'll name her ass as my accessory. We'll go upstate together. Hand in handcuffed hand. Now that shit's a promise, understand what I'm sayin'? You tell her that, and I'll call you back.
I have a bond receipt for you to sign.
That's what Winston does. He finds people who don't want to be found.
You get used to it after a while. Now tell me where my money's at.
And where's Jackie?
That I gotta see.
No.
We been shoppin'. Can't have my boy running around lookin' like a bum on the street.
Not if your ambition is to get high and watch TV.
He leave town?
Home?  This is your home. You're dead.
What are you then?
Then what are you doing here?
No! Oh God.
No, thanks.
No, don't. But thanks.
Yeah, ever since that ...
You know, I've been to three shrinks and a hypnotist. Nothing penetrates that night. Nothing.
What do you want from me?
I'm hanging up.
Don't bother to call again, okay?
Gabe?  What are you doing ... ?
Ah! I thought you were a mailman.
Then why aren't you teaching? Why aren't you in a university?
But the paper ...
I think something's fucking connect- ed. I mean, a car tried to run me over the other day. Doug too, right? We've got six guys here going fucking crazy.
I thought you said she didn't say much.
You should go back to her.
Her problem is that you spent eight years getting a PhD and then went to work for the post office.
Oh, you'd be surprised. They just don't have their doctorates, that's all.
But I see them.
It's freezing.
I thought you said it was a nightmare?
Save me!
We better get an orthopedic man in here. Is Dr. Davis on call?
Goddamn it. I want Louis.
What the hell did you do, move all the furniture?
Jezzie, I can't see.
Pictures. Your wife was gonna toss 'em so "what's his name" brought 'em over on his way to school.
Why you left.
Why do you bring her up?
Show me Della!
I don't believe this. I'm calling the doctor.
It's gone to the top.
Lie down!
Sam, Tony, come in here.
Here. I'll do it.
What?
You know what? I feel ... exorcised ... like the demons are gone.
In a way. At least now I have some idea of what was happening. If we can only get them to admit ... to explain what they did ... I don't know. Maybe it'd clear things up in my head. I'll tell you something, Jez, honestly ... I thought they were real.
Why didn't you call me?
Jezzie?
Stay away from me, Jez.
I tell you, it was so wonderful. I felt like a little boy. I saw Paradise, Jezzie.
Stick with me, kid.
No. Things are too hot. Later. I'll send for you.
I promise.
I love you when you're angry.
Cause you know goddamn well who I am.
What do you want me to say? My mother's tummy?
I'm not upset.
West.
Sit down, Jake.
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
You know who I am.
I don't get it. Who are you? Why have you been following me?
Long time ago.
The Ladder?
I don't know.
No. I couldn't.
They're awfully heavy.
Tan? What tan? It faded on the airplane. I'd try to get my money back, but who do you ask?  Two hundred dollars a night, for what?
That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
Where am I?
Where's Sarah? Where did she go?  She was here ...
That's a lie. My family was here.
I don't know what to do.
God almighty. I thought I was the only one.
Punk?
You got lucky.
Pause play.
Why wouldn't we be. I mean, look around. So far so good.
Sergeant? We thought you were...
Explosive. We're blowing the walkway.
Somebody's gonna have to go back to the engine room.
Thorgan, pull us in.
He....He...
I'm coming, I'm coming.
And now we're all out of it.
Brodski I'll talk slow so you can understand me. She's thawing. If we don't get her to the lab, she'll die, and that will be on your bald fucking head!
Give it a rest Yllo. She needs some time.
You just keep an eye out.
No, you're dead! You're all dead!
Oh man, what the hell happened?
Negative.
Teach! Where the hell are you?! Where's our visuals?!!
I'm pulling, damnit!
We have to get off this ship.
It's better this way. If we were rescued Jason would just get off the ship. You want him on your precious Earth II?
And what happend to ...?
Oh sure, all the time.
I think I had some when I was eight.
I know you.
We wait. I need about fifteen. Call me if there are any changes. If she farts I want a full report.
She needs a little time.
She's obviously dealt with this guy before.
GO, GO, GO!
Shit! Temp's dropping! We should have left this rock an hour ago!
I'll need the sergeant's okay on that.
Are there any other shuttles?
Somebody wanted the place to stay hidden.
Hold your breath. Initial cryo gasses will render you unconcious.
Ow!
We're missing two of the kids!
I just know.
Keep trying!
Then open the doors!
But?!!
See you then . . . doctor.
Nanotechnology.
They can deal with this sort of thing.
What?
You got it.
You got it.
You hired me, remember? It's my $10,000. It's my shark...
Tattoo. Had it taken off.
Dead astern! Zig-zag!
You going to be all right?
What'll I tell the kids?
Matt Hooper, the specialist they send down from the Oceanographic Institute.
What kind of a shark did you say it was?
Larry, we can re-open the beaches in August.
I was acting in the town's best interests...
Who are you?
Let's all have a drink.
Yeah. Like the kid on your beach. I wish I could've examined that shark they caught...
Rogue?
It's called Territoriality. It's a theory.
No, but Tiger sharks are the garbage cans of the ocean. They eat anything. But this one didn't eat any people. There's nothing here...
It is a job. I'm not fooling around like some amateur. It's my life!
They must've hit something.
Be careful, for chrissake.
That means closing the beaches.
It's a whale out there.
I can't stand here doing nothing!
No...  You think we can get back with those?
Just keep kicking.
I can't imagine why.
Oh, no, sir. I've never had a woman do that. I'm sure she drowned.
We never had any. What's the problem?
I saw a show with sea otters, and a big turtle... Mikey loved it. Made me promise to get him one. Will you live on the boat?
Let me see your hands...
Look, I don't need to hear any of this working class hero crap. Some party boat skipper who's killed a few sharks...
Anti-Shark cage.
Ever see one like this?
And I'll drink to yours.
Well, I'm not going to commit economic suicide on that flimsy evidence. We depend on the summer people for our lives, and if our beaches are closed, then we're all finished.
I don't know...
Sorry, Bleek... Going for my ultrasound. Gotta note and everything.
I always think you're cute. I think you're beautiful.
Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go.
I'm not mad. I'm in a fucking great mood. Despite the fact that I'm trapped in a fat suit I can't take off, despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back, despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday...
Not this time. You don't have any reason to be mad at me. You broke my heart. I should be royally ticked at you, man. I should be really cheesed off. I shouldn't want to talk to you anymore.
Like I'd marry you! You would be the meanest wife of all time. And anyway, I know you weren't bored that day because there was a lot of stuff on TV. The Blair Witch Project was on Starz, and you were like, "Oh, I want to watch this, but we should make out instead. La la la."
You know, I've been thinking. I'm really sorry I was such a huge bitch to you. You didn't deserve that. You never deserve any of the poo I unload on you.
No, for real. I think you are the coolest person I've ever met. And you don't even have to try.
Plus, you're the only person who doesn't stare at my stomach all the fucking time. You actually look at my face. And every time I look at you, the baby starts kicking me super hard.
I think it's because my heart starts pounding when I see you.
Basically, I'm completely smitten with you, and I don't care if I'm making an ass out of myself right now, because you've seen me make an ass out of myself a million times, and you still want to be my friend.
Here is the church and here is the steeple. We sure are cute for two ugly people. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Yup.
Yup.
I can't grow a moustache. It never comes in evenly.
No, I mean the father! Who's the father, Juno?
Oh Mac, no! He's a sweet kid. You know it wasn't his idea.
I would never barf in your urn, Brenda. Maybe L.B. did it.
Hon, did you get expelled?
I drove to St. Cloud to show Mark and Vanessa the ultrasound. And I wound up staying for a couple of hours.
I don't know, I just did. And while we were waiting for Vanessa, Mark and I watched The Wizard of Gore and he burned me some CDs of weird music. He's kind of cool.
Technically, that would be kickin' it Old Testament.
What? No! Do we come off like paranoid yuppies or something?
What do you play?
Oh.
Sorry. I swear I'm not a gear snob.
Well, we were playing with them and I busted this guitar onstage. It cost me $800 and a dime bag just to have it fixed.
Yeah.
They'd say you came a long way out here not knowing if anyone would be home.
Yeah?
It's only my favorite song. It's Sonic Youth doing "Superstar" by the Carpenters.
Well, sort of. Vanessa likes Madison for a girl.
That suits you.
You're something else.
I'll handle this. I'm really good at diffusing mom-type rage.
Hilarious. No, I just keep all of my old comics down here, and I want to show you one of them.
You're gonna like this, I promise.
You've never been to a dance, have you?
What are you?
What's the matter?
But you're old!
No, not yet. I tried to work on it a little last night, but I'm having trouble concentrating.
Yeah, but I hardly noticed it. I'm more worried about the part where I have to start wearing jeans with an elastic panel in the front.
Happy? Oh, you mean like, physically. I'm good. Look, I have a snooze button now!
I also have good teeth. No cavities. We finally got fluoridated water in Dancing Elk.
You mean like couples?
Well, of course. Your old D-A-D! You know I'll always be there to love and support you, no matter what kind of pickle you're in.
Thundercats are go!
I am a suicide risk.
It's not a food baby. I took three pregnancy tests today. I am definitely up the spout.
That's the kind of emotion I was looking for in the first take.
It's extremely complicated, and I'd rather not talk about it in my fragile state.
I'm staying pregnant, Le.
There are ads? For parents?
Yeah, but it sucks for free.
I was thinking a graphic designer, mid-thirties, and his cool Asian wife who dresses awesome and plays bass. But I'm trying to not be too particular.
Or stage parents!
Almost eight. You wouldn't believe how weird I look naked.
Katrina? Pfft, no way. He doesn't like Katrina. It must be a pity date.
Are you looking for any other compensation?
They're yellow.
Nesting, huh? Are you planning to build the crib out of twigs and saliva?
It all just happened so fast. We put that ad in the paper. I thought it would take months if, you know, ever and then -- boom -- Two weeks later, she's in our living room.
Don't mock me.
Looks like it, yeah.
Karma.
You can?
It's a portfolio of my work.
Sure.
Took 'em all.
You think Early's bad to me, don't you?
What's Early been in jail for?
Early didn't kill nobody, he wouldn't do that. I don't know why you're saying those things. You ain't my friend.
Almost.
What'll we do out there?
Yeah I left him with the car... We're all squared up now.
Early, sing me a song.
It's Chinese food. It was the only place open. You said you was starving, you'd eat anyth...
That's a good idea. Unfortunately most of them have been executed.
It's just a work in progress, kinda rough.
He almost always killed strangers. Spent years moving on from one place to another. That made it real hard to track him down.
I always thought it was the work of a serial killer. Anyone who took that much time and care bisecting another human being must have been enjoying it and would have done it again. And again. Until someone stopped him.
What happened to Adele?
Thank god!
It was definitely the high point of the evening.
Lighten up...
Listen, Eric's been "finishing" his for over three years now.
Where's Adele?
Siesta.
He wasn't going to shoot her, you murdering son of a bitch!
I ain't got nothing against God. It's the people he let come into the world... lot of them should have been stopped at the door. What are you looking for?
Right, I talked to you on the phone. They say it's a torch job, that sound like your boy?
Well now I'd say that's the least of Mr. Diebold's problems.
With four of them, I didn't use any kind of protection. Wait, maybe it was three.
Uh. Yes. Twice they weren't. Two times they didn't.
Who am I? Who am I? The mothafuckin' virgin surgeon.
You could tell she took care of herself. She had all these powders and creams in her bathroom.
What do you mean?
You mean like fucking two virgins at once.
What do you want?
Are you hungry?
He lives on 76th?
A little bit. But I didn't really want her to.
I don't know. That's too easy. I mean getting a virgin to suck your dick. That's so easy.
I want to knock her guard down. I mean there's a whole philosophy behind it. Having a virgin suck your dick, that's basic because there's nothing lost.
Right.
Man I haven't seen her in forever. What the fuck's she up to?
He looks like my uncle.
Who?
Bet.
Naw. But we should run by the park and get a dime. Maybe Darcy will be at the park.
Hey Jennie. Long time no see. What are you doing here?
Right here.
Hell ya. We broke that mothafucka.
Nuffin' G. Just forget it.
Come on bitch. Throw your fists up.
Right now?
She won't? Why not?
I don't know. I'm supposed to go to Nasa tonight.
I don't want you to hurt me.
Bang up stuff.
Yeah.
But, I don't know. I'm just scared that things would change. Between us.
I don't feel so well. Have you seen Telly anywhere?
I guess so.
But I only had sex with Telly.
Oh it's OK. That's life. Maybe tomorrow I'll win lotto. Who knows? You don't. No one does.
Yeah, I guess so.
No.
What if you can't make yourself happy? What if everything falls apart?
I'm fucking serious. Where's Telly?
Foreplay. Foreplay.
Don't go anywhere. Stay with me.
Yeah. Speaking of stupid shit. Him and his ape ass of a friend Casper, they all just almost killed some kid.
I don't know. Just some messy little scrap. You know that bullshit.
I'm not sure. He said something about meeting Darcy. I think he likes her now.
Yeah. She should be at Nasa tonight. Why you lookin for him? You like him now or sometin'?
Whah you say? Dissdee?
Making love is like.
It's like...
Yeah I get bored.
Did they ask you a lot of questions?
It's not his fault. He had a hard life.
Holy shit. That's all true?
It's grandmother style.
To come?
Yo, let me get in your parent's room man. Just fir a little while.
Oh, we'll be back.  You can bet on it.
No.
He says it's a game.  All games have a strategy.
I used to.  With my old man.  He taught me how to hunt and trap.  Trapping's a lot harder than most people think.  We used to go after Raccoons mostly. They'd get into our garbage, our fields.  When an animal can't live peacefully with those around it, it has to be destroyed.  But they're crafty little devils.  You see the trick is, you can put your trap down, but no Raccoon is going come near it unless you lay down the scent.  You ever smell Raccoon scent?  Smells like shit, but to a male Raccoon it smells just like pussy.  He'll walk right up to that trap, even though it don't look nothing like a Raccoon and stick his Goddam head right in it.  You know why?  Cause he can't help himself.  The scent drives him.  So, if you want to catch a Raccoon all you gotta do is figure out where he is -- lay down the scent -- and sooner or later he'll walk right into the trap.
No, I need the original note.
I'm positive.
What?
I gotta friend over there.  He was telling me things are kind of slow. So, I figured I'd give him a call, have him come down here and look through your records.  You know, give him something to do.
Run it down.
I'm sorry, this is just too convenient.
Anything?
Check with the State.  If he's never killed outside of Washington the F.B.I. wouldn't have it.  Nolan?
She's unconscious, but they think she's going to make it.
It's a voice modulator.
I've got a feeling we're going to go the distance with him.  Let him sweat for a little while.
What was suspicious about him?
Who is this?
That's something you'll have to figure out for yourself.  Really, Peter, you can't expect me to answer such direct questions.
Where is she?
If you got something to say to me, just come out and say it!
I really wish you'd stop trying to maneuver me.  I find it irritating, not to mention insulting.
You're not playing very well.  There are clues all around you and you keep missing them.
Please, I don't want to get into the psychological aspects of my actions. It would detract from the game.
So is mine, within the framework of my rules.
If it's so important, why don't you just tell me?
You heard me.  Why did you go out to the institute looking for her?
You're groping.  I have been fair. It's my move now.
Can we correlate data?  Look for specific things, like player's ages... stuff like that?
Okay.  Run a search to see if there are any players with a rating above two thousand that live on the Island.
Never mind.  He died two years ago.
You still haven't figured it out, have you?   You think that I've put you through an ordeal.  My scars run so much deeper than yours.
Oh, well we wouldn't want to disturb your guests, would we?
--the same type as the girl who got killed.  Jesus, Alan, the guy could be a psychopath.
Don't patronize me!  You sent me into a potentially dangerous situation and didn't warn me!
Boys.
Not that I can see.  We'll know more once I get the lab reports back from Seattle.
I know that.  I've seen the photo's.
Peter's right, Captain.  He's got to be forced into making a mistake.
What did he mean by Huxley?
He moves around a lot.  Why?
About a quarter to one.
What does that mean?
To my room and then I went for a walk.
She called to give me my schedule for tomorrow.
"Is".  Did you tell him about the institute?
But he had to dump the body there to make the move.
A building?
He uses castles...plural --  then says "can't move me."  Singular.  Not can't move us.
Wait a minute.  There's an apartment in that area called the Castle Arms.
Are we going to go through this again?
I went out.
Whatever's on your mind.
No.
What are they, please?
How come you don't stay with them?
Yes.
If you're asking me if I'm passionate about what I do, the answer is yes. Without passion, nothing moves us. What's your passion?
I had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation.
Getting too hot in here for you?
I don't think I could.
Another kind of game?
This isn't a game.
That's true -- but the emotion is still there.  They just learn to control it.
That's not fair!
I'm sorry.
It must've been very hard on Erica?
I said I didn't plan on getting involved.
The line was busy.  I'll try again.
Then why are you backing up?
But what does he mean by a fierce magazine?  Violent?
I just wanted you to know in case you thought about it in the future.
<u>What</u>?
We're not married <u>yet</u>.
About what?
Colwyn.
No. They watch me closely, but they haven't harmed me.
In a great fortress in the mountains. Wait. Something's happening.
That way. I can feel the cold.
In the old books. It's called a glaive.
But there is another entrance to this place.
You have rope?
You won't have to.
Then we must be ready. Five leagues from here is the Eastern Tower. I know the Barons who hold it. Good men, and brave. They will help us.
Everyone of his race is born knowing the day of his death.
No. Then they were led by his underlings. But I knew he had come this time, from the ferocity of their onslaught, from their use of The Fortress. They use up much of their strength to do these things. They are taking great risks.
Like you, she has extraordinary powers. He would make her his Queen.
You're coming with us.
Perhaps you think no man would return to me.
A forest near the Valley of Needles.
<u>What</u>? Oh no! Better it was me. There isn't another good tomato within a hundred leagues.
So your sons will speak of you to your grandsons, and your grandsons to their grandsons.
To the place where Death lives.
That I promise you.
I'm all right.
Not sleepy, either?
They do not exist, except in the waters of the Swamp, where they will remain.
At the gallop!
And mine goes with you.
I have a cinnamon bar.
You can have half.
I'd wish for a puppy.
I don't think it's working.
It's right behind you.
Would you desert your friends?
You had better manners as a pig.
We have plenty of hares.
The greatest boon of your otherwise worthless life, blockhead, is the privilege of dining on boar roasted by the hand of Ergo the Magnificent.
And who is <u>he</u> that they should join <u>him</u>?
He will not come. You will be my queen.
Modred has treated with the Dark Ones.
I knew.
We will have to try again. His knowledge is great. Without it, we cannot hope to win.
Such a vision will be opposed. Who seeks it?
Her name is Death.
Yes, they are weakening. It takes great power to maintain the Fortress, and they have expended much.
Ynyr!
Could not. Could not betray the girl to whom I was betrothed.
We had no children.
Where is he? My son.
Of what?
Tomorrow, the Fortress of Krull will rise with the sun in the Valley of Reeds. But the knowledge is of no use to you. No man has ever escaped the Web. And soon the creature will come for you, even here.
Why do you want to know?
OK. Mister Stansfield, Norman STANSFIELD.
No?
What, for example?
Yeah...  Come on, have a little training.
Yeah, but I didn't get him, I got his case and now he's behind the tree. What can I do?
OK.
How do you know it's love, if you've never been in love before?... It may be friendship... or the love you can have with a brother or a father... How can you know?
I never rent my gear.
Mathilda, stop, please!
...Don't you like me?
...I don't know.
Stop, Mathilda! Don't talk like that!
Then? You didn't give a shit about her father, didn't you?  You met anyway?
Nothing, for the moment.
Yeah, what?
It will take them five minutes!  How long ago did they arrive?
Not at all, Mathilda! I tell you because it's true! You'll buy the globe you told me about and you will choose, OK? We'll go where you want! I swear, you'll see, Mathilda!!
...I got lost, Mister.
I have no fear.
Huh, that's good!
Huh?
...And how much is it?
Yeah, but I don't give a shit about.  I trade at left, at right and that's dangerous in there...
Giancarlo... Rinaldi.
...Even his mother wouldn't.
Why am I such an authority?
I received my B.S. from the University of Pennsylvania, my P.H.D. from Bryn Mawr College.  I worked three years at the Boston University School of Medicine, during which time I had articles printed in the "Journal of Educational Psychology", "American Journal of Psychology", "Psychology Review" and "Science"... So I think it's safe to say my opinion is valid.
High-top Nike Cross-Trainers with heel support and air-cushioned soles.  They're nasty.
Maybe later.
Put out a P.B.S.... Or whatever it's called.
Are you and your friends planning on driving soon?
You need a ride, Preacher?
I'll kill you!
You do?
I don't follow.
Sometimes people need to see things done for them -- because sooner or later they don't believe the words anymore.
You've just decided, is that right?
You can change.
Yes.
Good.
Pacifica, California.
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
And that that soul takes part of the person they were on this earth with them.
His name is Maurice.  He's dancing around everything else.
You'll probably be bigger than your brothers.
You know what... I remembered you were here and I woke up.
You know what... maybe I ran onto the field and hit a home run.
You know what -- that was a really good story... Tell it again.
Making the grand total?
Mammoth.
Umm, no.  It's just that --
Umm, Coalville Utah.
Maybe.
They called her 'Lizy' in the book...  Sorry I was late.  My jeep died on the way over from the paper.
Write from your heart.  That's why the classics are great.
Yes.
I always knew you had good instincts...  Goodbye Kris.  I'll see you when I get back.
Why know?
So I've been informed.
It's mine to risk.
You ever lose somebody Stephanie?
Good morning.
Yes.
Hello.
What do you mean?
Yes, I heard, and it's not a problem.
No alcohol?
No -- S.E.R.A.
Maybe another drink first. More tequila?
I don't care about that. There's time left. You can have more money. You can drink all you want. You can talk or listen. Just stay, that's all I want.
Are you serious.
No, I can't have dinner with you.
You OK out there?
Is that really what you want to ask me?
What are you thinking? Are you angry with me?
There's no reason to blow all your money on a hotel room.
So... I'm not too concerned with long term plans.
Sorry.
Then come.  I'm going to change. Watch TV. I'll be half an hour.
When?
Do you want me not to go tonight?
They wouldn't know.
Last spring I happened to walk past a house that I had once patronized. There was a cool breeze blowing off the ocean and through the window I could see a bare leg. The girl must have been taking a break between customers. It was a strange moment for me because it reminded me of my mother and despite the fact that I was late for something already I just stayed there, loving the atmosphere of it and my memory and... the reason I'm telling you this epilogue is that I felt that I'd come full circle.
Yes.
Hey Ben. There were a couple of guys looking for you.
I was going real fast down on the beach and something slipped and everything got jammed up.
Right here at the hotel. Why?
I have a 4.0.
I don't need backups. Harvard is the school I'm going to.
Insurance? A love affair? Pure unadulterated hatred? Believe me, the DA will come up with plenty of reasons.
Get up.
He's an ass that's gonna try.
You took my class in LA. You had the best high kick I've ever seen. Are you one of my lawyers?
Whatever it is -- it could save you.
Did she have a weapon in her hand?
Was there any reason for you to believe she had discarded a weapon?
No. I was in the shower.
Yes.
Two a year since I was twelve. You do the math.
Because they got wet.
Tell him, Paulette.
He's gay -- he isn't Brooke's lover! He's making it up. Whoever killed Heyworth is paying him off.
Not really. I know how competitive it all is --
Just the love in my heart.
Donovan's firm is defending a major murder case and his caseload is so heavy he's taking on first year interns.
What'd you do?
She's from Connecticut. She belongs to his stupid country club.
Look at him. He's still scratching his head.
That's because men are big, fat retards who don't -- Oh, my God...
I know. I thought that was very -- classy of you.
What?
No way --
I will...
Thanks again for your help!
Uh, for starters, she won't give us an alibi --
I never trust a woman who's not blonde. Except for my friend Serena, but that's only because she's a blonde at heart. That's the whole reason I'm starting the Blonde Legal Defense Fund.
It would be a full-service law firm, by and for blondes, providing positive blonde role models and community outreach in high blonde areas. I mean, think about it -- name one blonde intellectual role model.
The bags under your eyes. You're an attractive man, but you need to take better care of yourself.
I'm quitting.
Law school was a mistake. Getting this internship was a mistake.
Then, forget it. Besides, I have an early class tomorrow.
What happened?
I just don't understand what went wrong --
I got bangs!
Where's Warner?
Why not?
I changed my mind. I'd pick the dangerous one.
You should. Do you have a resume?
She was a Delta Gamma! Not in my pledge class or anything -- she graduated five years ahead of me. But I used to take her class at the LA Sports Club. She's amazing!
Has Warner Huntington checked in yet?
There's a pizza welcome lunch in twenty minutes. Does that count?
You're breaking up with me?!  I thought you were proposing.
Then what? My boobs are too big?
How can it be the right thing if we're not together?
Uh -- sure.
Sarah was my girlfriend at prep school. We got back together over the summer at my grandmother's birthday party.
Thank you. Having fun?
But what? We took the same LSAT, we take the same classes --
I gave her my word, Warner.
Are you serious?
Yes.
Why do you say that?
I didn't stick around long enough to watch him stick his swizzle stick in her mouth, but I'd bet my next check that that's where he was about to put it.
Yeah, luckily.
Faith.
Precisely.  Faith has persuaded them a pygmie with a sling can kill an armed giant.
I doubt the faeries will admire their beauty... Come, this will be fun to watch.
What do you want with me?
Too bad your precious Jack can't hear you... the damsel in distress... A rescue attempt would be most amusing... We could flay sweet Jack alive as an after-dinner entertainment...
Or looked so beautiful...
Precisely, my darling.  Your animal strength, your primitive power has surfaced... you are what you desire.
You don't ravage the countryside, devouring maidens and burning the crops?
It's terrible.
I need your help.  In order to fight Blackheart, I must wear the armor of Achilles.  I --
You'll have a long, long rest in the tomb, me lad.
I fear she's lost.
It looks... er, delicious...  Such a fine bouquet... very aromatic...
Aye.  Honeythorn Gump'd be a powerful wizard indeed could he answer.
Jenny Greenteeth?  Who's she?
I know where to find it.  Taking possession be another matter.
We've no time for tricks this day, Honeythorn Gump.
A true and troubling question, Gump... We'll start from where the unicorn was killed.  The Baron must have left a trail.
Birds speak to me all the time. What did it say?
Sounds like the bird we want.  All right lads, follow yon raven!
Foul fellow, this Couer de Noir.
Dwarves be very sensitive about their feet.
God protect you, Honeythorn Gump.
There's the way, mates.
Willful creature, that one...
No, thank the Lord, but she be sore envenomed by the spider's bite.
We'll trust in faith, Gump.
Long as we don't lose heart, Jack...
The chill is worse this night.
It feels wrong, Jack... like a trap.
Never mind.  Just do it!  Retrieve the arrows somehow.
It's what we'll find there worries me.
The wound is mortal.
Plan on carrying some away in a kettle?
Sapphire!
Listen to him.  Not in the mood...
Might not need a gesture quite so grand.  What were you doing the very moment the Baron's curse fell on the world?
Go on... go on...
And did you?
Hush up, Screwball.  Do your own worm-sticking if you like the taste so well.
These chaps'll need a woodpecker to pick their teeth.
Screwball!  Be quiet...!  We have friends live 'neath the Needle. They'll no doubt provide safe refuge for the night.
Gonna make ogre-stew!
Sport, indeed.
All right.  I'll show you something sacred.
Shhh!
In these woods you are a commoner. Now be quiet.  True royalty approaches.
Are you honest?
I'm not your judge... nor have I any desire to witness the trial.
My own father...
A maid must beware of flattery... Methinks you want to kiss me.
If I were your bride, would the kissing ever stop...?  Do you wish to marry me, Jack?
Oh, la...
Do you wish it, Jack?  Wish you this our wedding band?
Only what's right...
And I... love you...
Whilst you were sleeping, I fetched your ring.
I can't have been under much more than a minute.
Is what you said about the ring but another dream?
You're teasing still.
The moon herself would hide behind a cloud rather than dare comparison with you...
A unicorn's been slain.  The last stallion in all the country.
You'll need the fastest steed alive, for Couer de Noir's castle rests at the very edge of the earth.  Only the sharpest sword and the golden armor of Achilles will protect you from his fury.
Ask away, sweet man.
Far as you're concerned she's dead, believe it or not.
What a fine meal you'd make, be the rest of you sweet as your tongue.
Sorry.
Then, tis not for chastity? Methought you kept a naked blade twixt you and any maiden chanced spend the night.
I'm partial to oaks, as are all faerie folk.  Mayn't I come visit sometime?
Only that?
Jest with me then.
Pray you be sweet as your words, dear Jack.
Small miracles better than no miracles...
No speeches!  What's a little swim after sticking worms and ogres?
I slew the Lindfarne Worm with it.
He was there and then he wasn't!
Who are you?
Here, honey!
And why was the alarm on?
You'd better call and cancel.
I couldn't sleep last night.
Uh...using Josh like that.
I'll survive.
Marilyn Manson...and I guess he's into guys.  I hate nose rings.  And the blue eye shadow thing really isn't working.
Nope.
I'm not shaving my legs or pits this summer, I've decided.
What did you think it would be?
Yeah.
No thanks.
I don't want you to!
I'm not gay.
Just, I mean, well, you're here every single day.
We've known each other since grade school.
I've been dreading you.
What are you on?
Maybe that's too long.
From the day I started...to today.  Can't stand it.
Uh huh.
Thank you.
The plumber's due out on Friday.
And you thought they might be under her dress?
To check up on me?
You live in Cory's parents' cabin?
I'll get your bag.
You have everything?
Why?
And I don't take a shower in the middle of the yard.
You can't promise me anything!  You don't have anything to promise!  You live in a garage!  You don't have cable!  You're not hooked up to the internet because you don't even own a computer!  You don't have a job!
I don't know.
My dad used to play a game.  I never really understood what it was until after he was gone.
I know.  Why?
I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying.
I think she was terrified of living with him...but maybe even more terrified of life without him.
Everything would have been better if you had.  You'd have liked your grandmother. And there'd be a girl out there that'd have her mother.  I remember reading about her in the paper.  They couldn't find her father and her mother was dead. I still feel guilty about that.
After everything he did to you and your mom?
Are you taking them still?
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
Yes.
You lied to me!
Isn't that weird?  I mean, I dated a little bit after my divorce, for four or five years.  Six years.  I know when my son was younger...maybe when he was ten or eleven even, he'd run up and wrap his arms around me.
Do you know what I'd give to have this! Forget how I got it!  I can't afford dirt in this town.  I live in Riverside, Goddammitt  And you get to piss in the ocean.
Thanks for telling me.
I know there's an explanation.
I need you to do me a favor.
I don't let him.  He just loves to.
You let him pierce his nose?
You didn't think someone from your office would call and tell me you wrecked the entire building and threatened people with a baseball bat?!
What did you do with your dog?
Look, I wasn't serious about you taking Sam, so you don't have to get into any actual construction to get out of it.
Friday...God, I hate the thought of him home all day.
Did you tell him he was spending the summer with me?
What have you been before today?
The antibiotics weren't working.  It's what I believe, George.
You're not well.
This was my very first slow dance.
I smiled at him.
I can hire workers to help me.
What did I say?
Left you?
What?
Don't even...I'm there.
Everything happens for a reason.  That's what my dad said.
Do you remember anything I've said that wasn't negative?
Sooner than the Fall.
You can't go because of Sam?
I never asked for more.
It's not ours.  It's George's.
Why?
Dad's home, already?
Nagger?
Better make it a week.
It's a boy! Well, let's get a look at him.
Hell with him. It ain't that.
What am I gonna do out there, Ray? I can't go home to my mama like this. I'll get the strap for sure.
We played down in Jackson yesterday. Heard a rumor you've got a boy up here who can hit the ball a ton.
Is Spanky here?
But this is where the action is and I have to be where the action is. Look, when your old lady wanted those alligator shoes, didn't I come through for you? Ain't she stepping in style now?
I look good tonight. And I feel lucky, too.
Real nice guy, too. Trumpet player. They moved down to New Orleans.
Yes, boss.
I was hoping you were gonna say an engagement ring, Claude.
Of course I did. He said he'd file an appeal right away. You didn't tell me he was so good looking.
He seemed like a pretty good lawyer to me. His offices take up an entire floor of that big, new building on 125th Street, and he was using all these words I never heard before. He even offered me a job.
You're cute. You have any money, Claude?
Probably to Spanky's headquarters down at the pier.
Look, man, I don't want friendly conversation. I don't want to be your friend. I've seen your friends and I don't like them. I just want to do this thing and get back to New York in time to start my job.
Hey, you'd be surprised what you find in other people's pockets. Just gotta avoid them deadbeat bank tellers. Get you every time.
You gave up baseball to be a bank teller? I can't latch on to that.
You need collateral.
That thing? Who'd you steal it from?
Oooh...
What gave you that idea?
That jelly you were talking to right here?
He even got my daddy's watch.
My daddy's watch. This is the dude I was telling you about --
We? Did I hear you say we? As I recall, you're the one who said there is no we. Guess we got some bad news in that letter, huh?
At least you're honest for once. So now you want to be my friend? Well, let me tell you something, Claude-my- shit-don't-stink-Banks. You got a lot to learn about friendship.
New York's a long way's off. Let's just keep moving, okay?
I don't know. Who do you want?
The only thing I regret is the day I met you.
That's the way it is.
I didn't do if for you, anyway. I just ain't no boot-licking trusty, that's all.
What the hell are you doing in that trunk?!
Some faces you just don't forget. Warren Pike's is one of 'em.
We'd be in the hole by now. Hey, man, you're peeing on my shoe.
No, believe me, I'm gonna kill him!
That's because you're soft. Gimme the gun.
You don't want to hear it, you don't want to hear it. There's no shame in that.
You didn't get ketchup?
I try to moisturize regularly.
No problem. Oh, boy!
New York. That's up north, ain't it? They'll find we do things different down here.
My corn bread? Oh no, my friend. I love corn bread.
I seen the bodies before they sealed 'em up. Them fellas sizzled up good. Looked like some shit from the X- Files.  Damn, that shit's nasty.
I think that old man lost his marbles about a hundred years ago. Come on, let's get this over with.
Sixty-five years ago. They always said the farm couldn't hold 'em forever. Looks like you're finally free, boys.
Rayford!
Don't argue with me. You need it more than I do. I know how a little money can help in a place like this.
Don't say that, Rayford. Don't ever say that. He gave up hope. That's where you gotta be different.
I gave you life. And they can't take it away from you. Remember that. You'll get outta here someday. I believe that. You gotta believe it, too.
You don't have to twist my arm.  Say now, that gumbo has quite a kick.
Like you shot Winston Hancock?
Satchmo.
You mean the Boom-Boom Room?
All I need is the front money and a truck. I could be back in two, three days tops if I had somebody to share the driving.
He's sick?
What do you think about... Earth?
Well, we must get people sinning if we want to fill up our New Hell. How are things going down at City Hall?
So excited.
Try four and a half. At first I totally didn't like him.
Maybe try the opposite of that.
Yeah, you do...
Stronger, yes. Smarter, definitely. But you have something he doesn't have.
It would be so okay.
You're already there...
Trying to capture his brother in a flask and preserve the balance of good and evil on Earth.
Look, it's okay for me to shit the street. But you gotta use a toilet.
But those are my roommate's sodas...
Release the evil?
Look. You were really high. Things happen.
C'mon, man, I'm just asking for one Superbowl ring.
Put it back on my head. I'm falling apart here.
Cassius, didn't I tell you to stay out of your brother's mind?
Hey, Dad, I'm almost finished laying down my monsters of metal compilation tape. I really think it's a masterpiece.
Don't worry about coming up with anything. It's cool.
Well, I thought that after messing with your head, I'd give you a little kick in the keester.
And I also happen to be a Jets fan.
Well, I guess I'm going to have to take a mulligan on this one.
We gotta get this bad boy burning again. Ideas?
I'm just a demon, Nicky. I don't got devil blood in me. I'd last two minutes up there with your brothers.
By she, do you mean he?
Little nervous. Wanna puke.
We know where to find Nicky.
No thanks. I'm looking for a girl named Valerie who also smells like coconuts.
"Octopus people?"
Basically, yeah.
That was Cassius!
Eight-hundred, split down the middle. Tuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will be off limits.
Right. And as far as household items: we can share the soap, but we'll split the cost 60/40. Cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy.  Aren't you boiling in that outfit?
It's like eighty degrees in this hallway. You from the South?
I don't know.
A black guy?
No, I'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask.
Sir, I would prefer if you didn't raise your voice. It's making my muscles tighten.
Shut up! Shut up your damn mouth!
From? From? From?
Do you know how long all this will last? Not thirty years... or thirty thousand years... but thirty thousand years... and you'll be part of it. Ages will roll... Ages. And you'll be here... the two of you... eternally frozen... frozen... beautiful.
Your own work?
I don't care... Just get it over with.
Well, why not!? That's exactly how everything works. How else could the city stay in balance -- You have a better idea?
What an old, old man you're getting to be, Francis. Weren't you ever a Yellow? I bet you were even wilder than --  come on, Sandman.
Only a few? You're just not trying.
Did you?
I'm very smart.
Please... No.
I changed my mind.
I'm afraid to tell you.
Six. I go red next year.
I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, I suppose?
You know.
I'm going to run.
Speak to your friends for me, Jessica... please...
We're coming to Arcade.  Shall we Relive together?
That's nice.
But what is this -- why?
All right. But why? I didn't kill the Runner.
That's nothing... there's a Sandman behind us, too and there'll be more soon. Take me to them.
He's good, isn't he?
Some kind of breeding pens... I suppose... They say people used to breed animals, fish, anything...  ...to eat, of course.
It doesn't make any difference anymore.
You knew that I wasn't before, didn't you?  Why did you stay with me?
It feels like breath. It makes everything move. Your hair is moving.
Sooner or later, we'll have to try something.
Of course.
You're lying! You'll never have the chance to tell anybody anything! You'll be killed the moment you're seen!
Of course.  I don't know where...  I just took them for granted.  It's our only chance.
No.
What's that?
Hello.
Mother and -- ? You knew your mother and father?
No, no, no
Never, never, ever. Nothing.
Not yet.
What a pity. I was hoping you'd be here to bury me.
More... many more.
Oh my... I'll try.
You don't seem quite sure, Jessica.  Can you do it? Will you?
Yes, I thought my wife...
What do you mean by that?
And smooth... Almost no movement - back and forth, I mean.
Right... This just glided along.
Or something.
You know what I think?
Yeah, I remember.
Yeah... Call me at home. I'll give you the number.
It's me...
Meet me at the Starlight Motel on Sycamore... I'll be there in twenty minutes.
I used to.
No... A job... I didn't know what. He set up an appointment for me to see a man.
Andy?
What if Andy tips off Mr. Eddy?
We gotta get the stuff and get out of here.
Yes, I believe so.
Arnie called this morning while you were sleepin'. They miss you pretty bad down at the garage. I told 'im you still had a "fever".
Nice to know they can't seem to get along without ya.
You really don't remember the other night, do you?
Do ya good.
Sit down.
Did you tell the police this?
No.
His physical condition.
You came home. Your friend Sheila brought you here.
Warden, it's not him. It was not Fred Madison in that cell.
He's in the infirmary, being examined.
I've got men searching the building and the grounds now.
We'll get a tail put on him.
I'm not entirely certain, Captain. You'll have to see for yourself.
Yes, and we need to talk to him... if we can.  Mel, let's get Peter in here.
I don't know yet.
Not even close.
A headache?
No... There is, I mean, I use it as a practice room... it's soundproofed.
No, no. I want to go in.
The pain is getting worse. I need more aspirin.
Aspirin... fly head. I gotta have more aspirin.
No, no I don't. Are you sure?
What do you mean? You're where right now?
I must have fallen asleep. I was asleep when you got home, wasn't I?
All right.
Two detectives are coming out.
I don't know. Maybe a hotel.
But that doesn't solve the problem. Who is doing this? And why?
Whatever you say, Mr. Eddy.
I can see that.
No thanks, Mr. Eddy.
Sure... Sure, Mr. Eddy. You gonna pick it up later, or tomorrow?
It'll be ready.
Hey, Pete... How ya doin'?
Yeah... How ya doin', Pete?
I'm really glad you're doin' okay, Pete.
Sure.
Whatiya mean?
I do like you, Sheila.
Yeah.
Yes. Might as well - all of it.
Yes.
Fossils.
I'm a paleontologist.
Uh-huh.
This is the only thing I was able to save when those heathens surrounded me.
Okay, sister.  No offense. No offense!
Well, it's a good morning, anyway.
It certainly is.
All right, all right. Keep quiet.
Ha, ha - who are you to be talking about a mask? What do you mean? You've been wearing a mask ever since we met you.
Believe me, it's no fun. When you fellas picked me up at Baskul, they'd been on my tail for a year.
They're very nice people - except that they've got horns.
Bryant's Utilities - that's me.
It's unbelievable.
All right.
Say, listen - will you go and annoy the rest of your playmates? Let me alone!
Over by that hill.
Look, Bob!
How do you do?
Thank you.
Who, for instance?
Shall we go inside? I should so like to show you some of our rare treasures.
How do you deal with incorrigibles? Criminals?
Centuries.
Buy and - sell? No, no, pardon me, exchange .
And very true. Your lives are therefore, as a rule, shorter, not so much by natural death as by indirect suicide.
Amazing!  She still doesn't look over 20. When is she likely to grow old in appearance?
I can't let him go alone. It's suicide!
I don't need any advice from you! Get me a doctor!
No doctors?  That's fine. That's just fine.
The High Lama! Who in blazes is he?!
Oh, I'm so glad.
I'm sure you were. When would you like to start?
Pardon me
Are you so certain you are away from it?
How can we get in touch with them?
Now, my dear boy. You shouldn't
Personally, I've enjoyed your community very much. But my friends do not care for this mystery. They are determined to leave as soon as
Oh, the girl at the piano?
I knew you'd understand. That's why I came to you for help.
Come on! We'll burn the hangar. That will make light for them!
Aha - very good, Freshie.[3] Very good. You'd better put his name on the list and make out a report later.
You?
Dead?
It's far from over, from what I can see. This place gives me the creeps, hidden away like this - no contact with civilization. Bob, you don't seem concerned at all.
Chang's first question was about the pilot.
There must be some connection between the plane and this place. They must have deliberately brought us here. Why, Bob? What reason could they have for doing a thing like that?
Nothing about the porters yet?
You can't leave, George.
You mustn't. You've got to stay here now.
So you think I'm mad?
I'm tired of owing you things. You're free to go. Go ahead.
Oh, George . . .
Why not?
What do you mean - "fade away like an echo"?
You're wrong, George.
Yes, everything!
What was that?
As long as they keep on aiming at us, we're safe.  Come now, child.
Hiding? Oh, no. Hunting - I was in the interior - hunting fossils. This morning I looked up suddenly
Why, you - you Look here - he may dash us to pieces!
Well, Mr. Conway, for a man who is supposed to be a leader, your do- nothing attitude is very disappointing.
My name's Sondra.
A little boy whistling in the dark!? Do you realize that there is a British cruiser waiting at Shanghai, smoke pouring out of its funnels, tugging at its moorings, waiting to take Mr. Conway back to London? Do you know that at this minute there are headlines shrieking all over the world the news that Conway is missing? Does that look like a man whose life is empty?
I can't quite explain it, but everything is somehow familiar. The very air that I breathe. The Lamasery, with its feet rooted in the good earth of this fertile valley, while its head explores the eternal. All the beautiful things I see, these cherry blossoms, you - all somehow familiar.  I've been kidnapped and brought here against my will. A crime, a great crime, yet I accept it amiably, with the same warm amiability one tolerates only from a very dear and close friend. Why? Can you tell me why?
Bump?
You see, it's not a dream.
Why?
Struggling, why?
Why, mother?
I'd love it!
It's Fenner.
English!
Yes.  Barney!
I'm sorry.  I haven't even got any cigarettes left!
All right, I'll be there.
Hesitated, sir.
Well, I dunno.  I mean, when you looked at all the other options... it just seemed sorta obvious.
What the hell...
For instance...  It says here you lost your parents at 15, and, since then...
Yes, sir.
Well this didn't.
Actually, sir--
All the time, sir.
Why?  What are you gonna do?
What?
Such a shame, too.  Cause you made such a good impression the first time.
I taught kindergarten.
It was a long time ago.-
Why?
Let's check am out.
Gee.  You really think?
No. The aliens organized, all of them, and tried a coup. They made it seem like a radio show afterwards.
What if he's telling the truth?
I know you don't trust him.  You don't trust anybody--
Everything left the planet, right? Except one thing.    That little insect-- the one we found in Sudbury.  Did it leave when everything else left?
For how long?
Well, if the bugs have hatched, and they're not here... then where are they?
All of it?
Actually, it is a shotgun.  Hold onto it--
Or what's no horrible down here that everyone's trying to avoid It?
What is it?
Actually... I don't know.
Out of focus?
Well I'm going to give them something to be afraid of.
Most entirely.  Earth has been overrun with an infestation of a species which, in order for the planet to survive, must be exterminated.
Noon exactly.
This guy.  Where was he?
May I have a look?
Highway 119, just west of Smith. Why?
What about the other agents?  Ella? Tee?
Dee?  What are you doing here?
I got a planet check on that bug.  It's from way the hell out in the third belt. it's organic, formed in the same blast that made our solar system.
Well, uh... so we can got into things, I guess.
She died?
Because I found out about her...
I know... I do, too...
Yes, sir.  I'm Gideon.  The music relaxes the prisoners.
On account of those are not his eyes.  He had 'em swapped out to fool the scanners.
Lara --
Don't worry, Lamar.
I understand.  Sir.
I'm fine.
How could Witwer have accessed the case file?
We're years from that.  John, I'm asking you: please, come in, we'll shut down the system until we get this thing figured out.
Everybody runs.
No doubt.
Armor up -- sick-sticks and concussion guns -- this is gonna be close.
You're kidding, that's today?
You don't have to chase me, Fletcher.
Run the subscription list...
Did he close the front door?
That was easy.
Any ID on the shooter yet?
Yes, it is.
Yes.
You ever get any false positives? Someone intends to kill his boss or his wife, but they never go through with it.  How do the precogs tell the difference?
What does he think of your chosen line of work?
Why don't you cut the cute act, Danny, and tell me exactly what it is you're looking for?
Okay.  Fine.  Where the hell is that?
I need your help.
So?
That's great.
Are you kidding?  There's absolutely positively no way, on my best day, I could ever beat twelve seconds!
I know that.  I know you would have done anything to find me.  I know you would have died for me.
What the fuck is going on?
The innocents we now use to stop the guilty.
So you won't help me?
Most of the time, all three Precognitives will see an event in the same way.  But once in a while, one of them will see things differently than the other two.
I said the record is destroyed. The original report exists for all time.  I designed the system so that whenever a report occurred, it would be stored in a safe place -- but not declared.
It's always in the more gifted of the three.
Lara, I don't know why this is happening.  I just know they're setting me up.  I can't trust anybody.  I don't know who to talk to or where to go...  Lara?  Are you there?
We know why John was tagged.
Thank you.  This is Burgess.
Yes... It's called an echo.  The act of murder is such a violent disturbance in the future continuum that it sometimes repeats to the Precogs.
Yes.
Nice to meet you.  Gum?
People have gotten the message.  Gum?
Actually, Gordon, you're not gonna do that.  I'm taking control of the team.
Two?
We can stop him.
You "friend's" a murderer and he ruined our perfect record.  Six years, not one damn murder...
I'll reschedule.  I've been working too much anyway.
He shot a hole in the damn ceiling. So what?  You lose your son, let's see how well you handle it.
To what?  Trap him?
You don't understand... they're a hive mind.  It takes all three for their predictive abilities to work.
Do me a favor, Arthur, keep him on til I see what's happening.
Good afternoon, Bobby. I'll let Max know you're here.
No thank you.
Snifter are for warm drinks --
When served warm --
We have snifters
So?
Don't worry about me getting in. Just tell me where it is.
We're in Fashion.
Somebody's getting comfortable.
I don't know. Do whatever you want.
He's alright.
Bullshit.
Ricky, can you put on a seat belt?
Mommy works hard so you can have all your pretty clothes. Don't you like your pretty clothes?
You gonna bust my horns, or you want spaghetti
Chloe?
Easy night. Bachelor party. Can we give Wendy a ride?
The easy kind. They're young and rich and well mannered.
A draw. What makes you think they're well mannered?
I don't like you working with Wendy. Why are you working with Wendy?
Who's watching the baby?
I'm ready.
Maybe if you didn't go Rambo every time I did a lapdance, you'd still be doing it yourself. Meantime, I gotta feed my little girl.
Ho's a good guy --
Dude, listen, man. I'm cool. How much for the treatment?
Come on, dude. The other chick's giving my best man a blow job in the toilet. I know the drill, I'll wear a rubber --
Get away from her.
Ruiz don't like using names on cell phones. He refers to him as the Red Dragon.
To be honest, man, I don't know shit either. All I know is it ain't drugs and it ain't now.
What do you mean 'troughed?'
And not a word to Maxie. He'll shit if he knew we crossed a bridge.
Ricky's taken care of.
He was uptown when I paged him. I gave him the address. He's meeting us there.
Pshhh...
Mr. Reuben, I swear to God, they were out of line.
Then what are you saying?
I don't understand.
No.
I know.
Yeah.
Ruiz knows about this?
Yeah.
You want us to be wherever you want us to be, ASAP, no questions asked.
Tom, the Welsh dude --
You're going to the Soho Grand hotel, right?
Soho.
Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem.
You know, white kids with trust funds acting like they're poor. Keeping it real. Know what I mean?
It's important.
Yeah, I'm 5-5 and 1.
Shhh...
Bullshit...
You wanna go right now?
What are we delivering?
Why do you always get stuck taking care of the kid.
Shhh...  Yeah, yeah... No. No. I'll be there.  You gotta get me to the Magic Castle at four.
This paint sucks. The white shows through.
Nah, don't bother --
Yeah, bring up two burgers and a couple of Heinekens. I'm in room... How'd you know? Oh. Yeah. How long? Cool.
Forty-six.
Relax. You got one-fifty. You heard the guy.
But let me tell you, man, I don't like your attitude already.
As a matter of fact I was. You got a problem with that?
Well, I don't want to walk.
Fuck...
No. They asked who I was, then told me what corner.
Don't even start.
His names Horrace. Horrace, this is Ricky Slade.
Work's over. I'm gonna party.
Fine.
Dude, get back out there. You gotta help me get them in the hot tub.  Hang on girls! Just get out there. I'll be right out. You know how I do.
C'mon, man...
We don't need guns.
It was six in the fucking morning.
What do you have left?
Eighty bucks?!?
They only cover one fifty in incidentals. You've been ordering fucking... Motherfucker...
I fucking vouched for you. I vouched for you and you fucked me.
This is horseshit. It coulda been so easy.
I don't want to take any more chances.
And you grew up in Manhattan?
That's a good idea, maybe I will!
Well, come on then. It's back here.
What?
Hey. I'm half Lebanese.
He's on the list.
Yes.
Where do you live?
Maxie knows I don't go near drugs. I did a minute in Quentin for possession with intent. And it ain't now cause he woulda told me.
He spoke to me. You want me to dis him?
Why? What I say bad?
Ruiz? Oh, he ain't here.
Don't worry, man. It's all for you.
Couldn't make it. Here's the money.
No, man, that's fine. Just put that you took delivery.
The Soho Grand?
Yeah. Grab one of the cards behind you. Call that number. It's my cell.
We're square.
Go ahead. Open the fuckin things. You should each find fifteen hundred --
We're going to New York?
What?
So, you must be the Red Dragon.
Who's up for a night on the town.
When they want your ass, won't nothing keep you out.
Heard where?
Man's rep travels.
My papa taught me one thing: don't never bullshit a West Indian bullshit artist.
I done told the man what he could do with his train.
What?
Nnnnnnn!
Yeah, and I'm putting my money where my ugly mouth is. I'm putting you back in the numbers right now.  Baby, what's today?
What you talking?
You din't have no 1, 2, 8.
You never had it.
I ain't drinking hot piss with you. Come on, Sam.
I don't want your money.
Put it in a cup of water. It's nutmeg.
Man, you been locked up too long, everybody conks. All the cats.
Elijah who?
What do you do with your time?
You got to learn everything the white man says and use it against him. The truth is laying there if you smart and read behind their words. It's buried there. You got to dig it out.
Read it and keep on reading.
I sure met some.
For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth --
You can grovel and crawl for sin, but not to save your soul. Pick the lock, Malcolm; pick it.
Brother Benjamin, do not rush, it has to be exact.
No, Brother Minister.
Next week, Brother Minister.
That you haven't time for either marriage or eating --
I can handle it.
Why do you ask?
If it's just idle, I won't answer it.
Are you?
I know.
Because you're in trouble.
The talk is everywhere!
I was going to talk to Bembry about it tonight.
I'm not interested in personal publicity. Our people know what I'm doing.
What do you want me to do? Our people need me.
You have to sleep for three.
Let's get out of this cold.
Let some of us come down there.
What did I tell you about assuming?
I'm not saying anything, preacher. I'm proving to you that God is black.
Thank you. Now the Negro in the field caught hell all day long. He was beaten by the master; he lived in a shack, wore castoff clothes and hated his master. If the house caught fire, he'd pray for a wind. If the master got sick, he'd pray that he'd die. And if you said to him, "Let's go, let's separate", he'd yell, "Yeah, man, any place is better than this." You've got a lot of Field Negroes in America today. I'm one.
Do your job, Get me a bourbon on the rocks and a pack of Lucky's.
If she got eyes, she do.
Two years in the Women's Reformatory at Framingham.
Now you come back.
I ain't stupid.
500.
Please make way, please --
What mission?
I won't let myself come between you and your father. Go home.
And don't come back.
...That isn't a whore?
You better believe it.
Me?
Shorty, this is Laura.
You're too small to be Bogart.
Tell him about Baldy.
I've been clean for twelve years, Shorty.
How's the rest of the gang? You seen anyone?
Allah will provide.
I was special. The only colored kid in class. I became a sort of mascot. Like a pink poodle.
He's bright.
What do you want?
I don't know shit about you.
It's not worth it. Be with them instead.
Liar. Just tell me who the bank card belongs to. Name and address.
Off the top of my head, I don't know what they could've been.
[It's a permit to carry a gun in Columbia. The gun you're about to find in that suitcase.]
[Aurillio Rosas Sanchez.]
[We have an ATM bank card. We draw out 300 dollars every two weeks.]
[The what?]
[We don't know! We never see his face! We have to wait in the other room. He was screaming to the girl that...]
[Head of the anti-kidnapping division.]
[Romans, chapter 12, verse 21.]
[Where do I find him?]
I don't know, but I know his face.
[Mr. Creasy. What do you want?]
[I want you.]
[The ransom was ten.]
Yes.
I drink.
What do you mean, I'm here?
A bodyguard... Who's the guy?
You can drive and talk at the same time, can't you?
Let me guess, you wouldn't stop talking?
Pretty impressive. Maybe I need to up my fee or get a larger gun.
No.
Calling for Emilio's macaw. I thought I heard him.
How do you think he got out?
It's not too bad. Will it take a long time before it's better? Our big swim meet is in three weeks. Interschools. I was going to swim in the one hundred meter freestyle.
I had to do my homework on them when I worked there. Also I enjoy history.
I'm sorry.
I dropped her at home.
There's no such thing as tough. You're either trained or untrained.
That's not a question.
Still not a question.
I'm going to keep people safe someday. Just like you.
I could do it. Remember the day you wanted the pencil? I know why. And I saw that car again. I wrote the license number in my notebook. Except I missed the last number.
Dyslexic?
It's war. The weakest suffer the most.
I'm fine.
Then don't come.
Her beauty fucks with your mind.
[The money, 10 million U.S. will be divided into two 15 gallon black canvas bags each containing five million which will be checked at the bank by the K&R agent. Then driven to the house in an armored car where it will be transferred to the delivery car.]
This is Mr. Creasy.
Well, think about going to sleep. Good night, baby.
And bankruptcy. Where will that put me in the social strata?
Pinta loves school. She'd like Count Dracula is he took her back there.
[I should start going for your tits first.]
[He's the man, 'the Boss?' My guys got into the house on the pretext of giving cholera shots. We had to inject the whole Barrio. We bugged the house and stole the picture of him.]
I already ate.
I can take care of myself.
All right, I'm having a fair time. It's just that I get one Saturday night off in three weeks, and I wanted to wind up with something tonight.
What?
I don't know, Ang'. Wadda you feel like doing?
Oh, yeah.
She probably got a date by now, Angie.
I didn't like her, Angie. I don't feel like calling her up.
I don't know. What do you feel like doing?
Where?
Oh, I couldn't eat nothing. My mother just stuffed me right up to the jaws.
I feel fine.
They're the worst. College girls are one step from the streets. They smoke like men inna saloon. My son Joseph, his wife, you know, she types onna typewriter. One step from the streets, I tell you. Mrs. Pilletti ponders this philosophy for a moment.
I was up here twice before. Once with a friend of mine and once I came up alone. The last time... do you see that girl in the gray dress sitting over there?
I'm thirty-four.
I don't.
Yes, I know.
Nothing.
Hobby! What can she do? She cooks and she cleans. You gotta have a house to clean. You gotta have children to cook for. These are the terrible years for a woman, the terrible years.
I'll take you over, and I'll introduce you as an old army buddy of mine, and then I'll cut out. Because I got this other girl waiting for me out by the hatcheck, and I'll pay you five bucks.
I'll see you around.
Oh, no! She died right in the hospital...
Boy, that Mickey Spillane, boy he can write.
That means he'd have to marry the girl when she was one year old.
I'm coming home right now, Ma. I'll be home in about two minutes. Tell Thomas stick around, I wanna see him about something.
You gotta good heart.
You gonna get married.
I offered her, Ma, she don't want nothing.
Sure.
I heard you, Ma.
She's twenty-nine, Ma.
Well, let's not get inna fight about it, Ma.
Hey, Lou, gimme two bottles-a beer...
Waddaya read there, Joe?
You still owe me ten bucks from last week, if that's what you're working up to.
Hey, Marty, come over here a minute.
Hey, Louise, I want you to meet Marty Pilletti. Marty, that's Louise Kelly, inna back seat there.
This is a good deal here, Marty.
Oh man, you shoulda come with us last night, Marty. That one for you was a real lunatic. How'd you make out?
So what happened, Aunt Theresa, about the milk bottle was my mother-in- law, she comes inna kitchen, Aunt Theresa, and she begins poking her head over my shoulder here and poking her head over my shoulder there, so then she begins telling me how I waste money and how I can't cook, and how I'm raising my baby all wrong, so she got me so nervous, I spilled some milk I was making for the baby...
That's all right, that's all right...
I'm gonna see you tonight...
Sure, sure.
I don't wanna talk about it!
Why do you always put me inna position of being the louse?
I don't wanna hear anymore about it, you hear me?
You talked to Walt?
Put in one of your fixes. Walt knows he's loused himself with the Church, but it's part of our plan to make him think he has the keys to the kingdom. Which he will think if you grease the skids for him.
He'll live if that's what you mean. But somebody better be around when he comes to and finds out there's nothing left between his legs.
Just one for a start.
That's right.
No.  Or why you should.
Look at that right eye.
Good, because we got a fine old American custom we want to teach you. You know what these are?
No, Ho-Jon, we're not going to open you up.
Duke Forrest.
Ayuh, only it's early, I need a drink to wake me up.
Georgia, where I come from, it's real if you make it yourself. But I been buying from the Yankee Government since they put me in this soldier suit and give me a rate.
Except we forgot one other small thing.
You met him. Walt Waldowski, the Dental Officer.
What's he got to write, for God's sake?
It's supper time.  But you're not hungry are you?
I can't... couldn't.
Finest kind. We're training Ho-Jon to be a bartender. Join us?
You ever caught this bread, and forgive our syndrome before, Duke?
But what about Major Houlihan?
At ease. Captain Pierce, you have a seriously wounded patient for whom you are responsible. Yet I find you in a poker game.
We need medical officers for short- arm inspection starting the first afternoon out.
He's Trapper John! Only man in history who ever found fulfillment in the ladies' can of a Boston and Maine Railroad car! When the Conductor caught him in there with his Winter Carnival date, she screamed: 'He trapped me!' What have you been doing since those days, Trapper?
No, no, that one.
'Course it isn't, but how many chances do we get to go to Japan? With our golf clubs.
And if it isn't, why don't we call Washington on your telephone? You tell your story, we'll tell ours.
Radar!
Okay, but I'll need you to help. Duke, will you take that belly back there? The Australian?
They're coming.
We'll cut him in on the bets we make. And still have enough profit to send Ho-Jon to college.
He can move in here with us.
Honey, nobody as pretty as you could ever impose... please sit down. Coffee?
I'm glad you feel that way, Major, because you see it's a team effort... doctors, nurses, enlisted men... and I feel responsible for my whole team, and I want you to know I'm satisfied with them.
That's right. We work well together.
They don't have to be dull. I mean if you and me put our minds together...
Something else we have in common.
Of course not.
Though I guess who it'll really be rough on is your husband.
I didn't mean with me.
Thanks, Reverend. Thank you both for tipping me off.  You don't know a Captain Forrest or a Captain Pierce, do you?
Tell me the whole story, Walt.
Well, I'm sure my colleagues will agree there are a number of dependable measures for extinguishing the vital forces.
You guys got any black capsules?
I don't think so either.
I  wouldn't  wish  it  on  a  maneating  shark.
They've all tried. Nobody's got to first base.
But we strongly suspect something will happen to screw up this splendid organization of yours if you don't get that sky pilot out of our tent.
Major Burns will be out of your tent in twenty-four hours.  Tell them Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest are on their way.
It's the only way we can make enough to put Ho-Jon through Androscoggin.
You mean who hit who?
I deeply regret this unfortunate incident. We try to remember we're a military organization.
Yes, sir?
I'm afraid so, Colonel.
I used to throw the javelin.
What's that, Henry?
The address of the N.E.P.H. and W. Why don't you meet me there when you're through golf for drinks and dinner and whatever strikes the fancy?
A big, rich slob like D. B. Norton buys a paperand forty heads are chopped off!
Yeah. You, too? Oh, Joe . . . oh, I'm sorry darling . . . why don't we tear the building down!
Oh, I get the idea. Yeah, maybe.
Are you all right?
He likes you well enough to stick around.
With all of it?
Well, all those guys in the bleachers think
Oh, yuh did, huh?
No.
Look, it started as a circulation stunt, didn't it?
I don't know. About three hundred thousand.
How do you do.
Well, don't say anything at all. Just sit down.
All set, Ann?
Yes, I know, dear, but Mrs. Burke had her baby yesterday. Nine pounds! And there wasn't a thing in the houseand then this morning the Community Chest lady came around and
Father's . . . I never knew he had a diary.
I remember, distinctly, being fired.
Oh!
Plus a bonus.
Sorry.
He's perfect! A baseball player. What could be more American!
Oh!
Take it easy, John Doe.
Sure, it's a meal ticket for me. I admit it, but it's also a windfall for somebody like Mr. Norton who's trying to crash national politics.  That's what you bought the newspaper for, isn't it? You wanta reach a lotta people, don't you?  Well, put John Doe on the air and you can reach a hundred and fifty million of 'em. He can say anything he wants and they'll listen to him.
Oh, let me go, will you!
Yeah, a little.
Bush leagues mostly.[5] Med. shot: To include the rest of them. They have their eyes glued on his face. ANN is very much interested.
What?
Take charge of him. Get him a suite at the Imperial and hire some bodyguards.
Hey, did yuh get a load of the bedroom?
Hey. Who'd you say was gonna get him?
Tell him about making Sourpuss chairman, honey.
Old man Delaney has been bringing his furniture over to my place at night, one piece at a time, and selling it.
Well, thank you for listening. Goodbye, Mr. Doe. You're a wonderful man and it strikes me you can be mighty useful walking around for a while.
Sure, sure. I'd like to believe in fairy tales, but a guy that's fake isn't gonna jump off any roof.
No, sir. That spot under the bridge where we slept last night's good enough for me.
Sure. I remember . . . Say, did your ears pop coming up in the elevator? Mine did.
I seen plenty of fellers start out with fifty bucks and wind up with a bank account!
You bet I will! As fast as I can! Gonna get some canned goodsa fishing rod, and the rest I'm gonna give away.
Five thousand bucks!  I had it right in my hand!
Well?
That's right. You got it! Sure! He came in here and I made him change his mind. "Bulletin editor saves John Doe's life." Why, it's perfect. I'll have Ned write it up.  Oh, Ned!
No, no, no, the gal's right. We can't let the Chronicle get the laugh on us! We've got to produce a John Doe now.  Amateur journalism, huh!  I'll show those guys.
No, I didn't.
Willoughby. John Willoughby, Long John Willoughby they called me in baseball.
There's nobody holding you here, Mr. Doe.  It's only natural that people
No you won't! You're through deciding anything!
Were you paid for itor weren't you?
Thanks.
I'm terribly sorry she isn't here.
Huh? Oh, that you'll never be able to play again.
You're my hero.
It's not me. It's her. She's going out with this baseball player -- Greg Barnett.
It was Warriors plus 6 this morning.
You mean Frank who owns the bakery down the street?
I'm sorry, Mike. I never heard of LaMarra flipping on anyone before. He said he had the cops paid off. Antonucci never flipped on anyone before. He had the cops paid off.
What happened, Mike.
I got a couple thousand bucks. You could leave town.
Particles, man. I feel them all the time. I feel them in my arms and legs man, that's how they punish me.
It's not just the particles man, it's the whole fucking machine, this is how they get assassins to operate. It's been this way since the cuban missile crisis.
Huh?
Tell him what, what do you want me to tell him?
Is that where you're family lives?
Absolutely. Bank robbers are generally your smartest criminals.
What's the suspect's name?
Roper...
National Marksman Competition.
Been to Toronto. My mother was born there.
You caught me on an "up" day.  How about you? How did you end up in San Francisco?
I don't really like to drink.
Why? You like my ass?
You living together?
Explain how that works.
Oh, "city girl". Don't you ever long for companionship with her such a long way away in New Jersey?
Thanks for clearing that up.  I hear your former girlfriend is going out with Greg Barnett.
What? Bring somebody in so he can cut his nuts off?
Why?
A dirtbag behind the counter holding a sawed-off. A Berretta nine millimeter in his belt. A female hostage, red dress, on the floor in front of the cereal display. Male hostage, jeans and blue checked shirt, three feet to her right. Another male hostage, white pants, green shirt, Nikes, laying in front of the magazine rack. A female dirtbag with a gun under her shirt, sitting against the beer cooler, trying to pass herself off as a hostage, and there's a special on toilet-paper, four for a buck twenty-nine.
Because he knew the little girl had zero chance of survival and his chances would be a little better... We had a plan, but SWAT opened up too early. He got caught in the crossfire.  Let's move on... Notice this. Always use the eyes to keep the connection. It almost like hypnosis. That's the most important thing. Create a connection. You're always on their side...
To run late!
The jockey!
How much you wanna bet?
Bullshit! Would it have happened to you?
Don't know. She keeps screaming to stay out. He keeps screaming to stay out. We decided to stay out.
And why the fuck would you do that for me?
Who cares what you think. I want you back and that's all that matters.
You don't usually talk to anyone when you're hurting.
Scott, You can't save everyone.
If you did, you never showed it.
You got a bet on the game tonight?
It's because I wanted to keep you away from that world.
Just now.
It's very nice.
I think I'll stand out here in the sun.
Whoa! Wait a minute, Ronnie. Hold on. I know it's beautiful here. The sun, the sand, the sea and all that nature shit can really get to you. But we've got to keep our perspective here. This place isn't real. This isn't reality.
You talkin' about gettin' 'nekked?'  Shit, I thought you were talkin' bout, you know... the "M" word.
Your concern is heartwarming.
What kind of appreciation are we talking about?
What do you think would be in order?
What happened to your Trans Am?
He said he was just going up to talk to him. He said...  I want to be put on this case.
Who's running it!
32 minutes ago the silent alarm went off, then the fire alarm. A unit was a block away, and the suspect got trapped inside.
Yeah, they are but...
I need to take back what's mine.
Okay...
To live forever.
-- No.
About what?
No...
Yes.
No.
In a computer program.
And all dreams, no matter how appealing, must eventually end.
-- But you'll never be able to get it through the maze.
Yes, so which one of us does that make the coward?
Sorry, I just design the maze.  Keeping the keys secure is your job.
-- Come on, you know F.C.O. regs. Anyone caught with their R and D hand in the bio-digitization cookie jar spends the rest of their life in federal penitentiary.  It's not worth it.
It's not used for anything.
Why?
Why would I do that?
Try harder.
Then where is she?
No.
Her?
Not you.  A copy.
There?
Of course you do.  And the only shot you've got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program.

They're called squirbs.
Yeah, right.
I've never been this sore in my life.
I've got it!  We use the mirrors to reflect the light back into itself!!
... Let's take a look over there.
Use extreme caution, Rangers. You are dealing with an evil here that is beyond ALL comprehension.
Where did it originate?
TRICERATOPS!
NINJA WOLF ZORD!
GIVE IT EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT!
Listen, we appreciate your hospitality, but we really don't have much time.

LET'S FLY!
WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE!!
WE'RE OUTTA HERE!

A real shame.
By learning the ancient art of Ninjetti.  It is the Genesis of what you on earth have come to know as the Ninja.  It is the perfect union of mind, body and spirit.
Tommy, you are the Falcon, Winged Lord of the Sky.
What kind of landing was that?! These clowns are a menace to the sky
So they've been destroyed?
Activating Power Scope!
And I ain't no nigger either!
Got the same problem with my pop -- garlic. Nothin' you can do.
Poor, yeah.
You scare me, Charlie.
Could we step outside?
Precisely. We are the true entrepreneurs, and Prohibition is the greatest opportunity we shall ever have. America is begging to be taken like an overripe virgin, but they're still fighting over the crumbs of Little Italy.
You havin' any luck findin' out who did him?
I was calling yesterday.
You're sure?
It's a mask.
I'm doin' business here!
It'll all be over tomorrow. No more wars. No more killin'. Just livin' normal like everybody else.  You'll be stuck with me for good.
Like a party for all our friends.
What's your problem?
Is there a fuckin' point comin' up anytime soon?
Come off it, Bugs.
Whatta ya mean, Boss?
I know about you.
That little party's gonna make you a lotta money.
I'm still the Boss of All the Bosses! And you'll do what I say!
How can I trust you when you look at me like that?
The kid just called me stupid.
Shit. When I was comin' up, bein' fat meant ya had somethin' ta eat. Guy looked like you, people felt sorry for 'em. Right, Gerardo?
I've heard so much about this club of yours. I had to come and see.
I must know more of you, my son.
I've got friends.
Sittin' around gives me the piles. You got a proposition?
And the Jews?
You're fuckin' crazy. You're all fuckin' crazy!
What makes you think I give a damn about that Sicilian crap?
You disrespect our tradition.
No matter what you say to me Salvatore, you are my bambino.
Masseria's been after me too.
Spare us.
Let 'em kill each other off! Why should we care?
Come on. Be polite.
But only on purpose, Tommy.
He hadn't gotten a good night's sleep in years. The nightmares would wake him up, and he'd start right in painting... <i></i> That boy looked like pluperfect hell.

Yo, Jumbo. We got us some kind of <u>ventriloquist</u> here.

Bend over?
Back in your head, where he belongs. <i></i> No offense, Stu, but on your own you're kinda vanilla. I didn't want to send you back without him.
Thank me next time you see me.
I think it's a pig hair. <i></i> How much is McDonald's offering?
How much?
Yeah, I was thinking...I mean, I'm a celebrity now, do I really want to get married? But on the other hand, if you're married, they can't testify against you.
Kool-Aid!? But who'd would want to -
YOU SET ME UP!!
Home sweet home, huh? Actually, I was expecting something a little swankier. How much loot does old Stu rake in, anyway?
Ohhh, nothing.
Got a doctor on duty.
They only made the one episode. They've shown it about nineteen times.
That was <u>especially</u> Monkeybone. Come on, Doc, I don't want to be stuck here with this bunch of media creeps. I just want to be <u>us</u>. Home. Alone! <i></i> I have something I have to give you.
Who?
I'd better go report this...
Julie?... Hey, you <u>are</u> a looker.
Give me a date, Doctor.
How am I gonna get past the guards?
Thanks, Kitty, I'll never forget you for th--
I doubt that. Besides, I can't help myself. I'm just a figment of your imagination.
THAT DOES IT! BACK IN THE PACK!
<u>What</u> union?
Maybe he wanted to pick out his own casket?
Let's not kick the nice Reaper's ass.
Fine! Don't put yourself out. I'll go to the land of Death alone.
What?
Oh, don't you worry. I'll be fine.
I just need to use the phone, lady.
What happened?  Did you lose your keys?
That's New York.  It looks rundown, but it's safe during the day.  You'll get used to it.
I'm good.
No, I'm working too much, I don't have time.
Behind the books.
I was seeing Aaron and there were some ... complications.
That's not true.  Besides, I don't want you dusting.  I want you to see New York.
Aaron?
Dear, I was thinking.  Why don't we go to Paris next year?  I've never been.  Your father, God bless him, wasn't much for traveling.
Oh, it was such a big scandal.
And where is she?
This way?
Where's the Majority Leader?
I did not--
It couldn't be.
I'm saying I didn't sign it!
Yes, sir.  All right, boys--let's go.
What for? Why, suppose there's a storm--all lines are down--how you gonna get a message to Ma?
I'll brain that guy! Well--call Paine-- call Saunders--
No!
That--or he's out blazing trails. He'll show up.
Eight to five Little Boy Blue is plastered.
What show? Would you mind telling me what's coming off here?
What do I play?
And to Don Quixote!
Yeah. Funny--
Shut up, Diz.
Yeah.
Is the wind tired out there?
Do we *have* to?
Susan? Nah!
Right now--everything I own--!
Huh?
Wha--? Yes, sweetheart-- Wha--?
What is it?
Save that for the laying of cornerstones, Hubert!  Oh, that morning you looked in the mirror and saw a statesman!
I'll bear that in mind... What? Oh. Dinner. Pet--my stomach couldn't hold a bird seed.
Well, your children are very bright-- and *they* say Jefferson Smith.
Listen--the simpleton of all time--a big-eyed patriot--knows Washington and Lincoln by heart--stood at attention in the Governor's presence-- collects stray boys and cats--
Jim--the answer to a prayer--manna from heaven--the man *we want*--and the votes *we need*--
Is *what* getting me down?
Oh, a *boy*!
Uh--Jefferson Smith's residence?
I beg your pardon?
When Jeff gets through with Taylor--  Quiet! What do you mean by breaking in here--? Get out! Get *out* of here!
Well, that ends that crisis. This way, Senator.
To--to a reception--uh--for a princess-- I forget her name--
Mr. President!
The *Bills*? Jeff--let me advise you-- as your father would--politics is a business--sometimes a cruel business. In your time here, you couldn't even start on those Bills. They're put together by legal minds--after a long study. Why, after twenty years, I can't understand half of them myself. No, really, Jeff--in your own interests--
Nonsense, Jeff.
That's all right, my boy--don't bother--
Mr. President--gentlemen--I--I have risen to a painful duty--to say that, out of evidence that has come to my attention, I consider Senator Smith unworthy to address this body!
Will he yield for a question?
Will he *yield*?
Every *aspect* of this matter--the gentleman's attack on that section-- everything--was dealt with in the committee hearing--
I wish to ask the gentleman--has he one shred of evidence to add now to the defense he did not give--and *could* not give at that same hearing?
The committee ruled otherwise! The gentleman stands guilty as charged. And I believe I speak for all the members when I say that no one cares to hear what a man of his condemned character has to say about *any* section of *any* legislation before this house!
The gentleman has said repeatedly that he is speaking to the people of his State. He has been waiting, as he so fancifully puts it, for them to come marching here in droves. Would the gentleman be interested in knowing what those people have to say?
Jefferson--
How's Amos, Ma?
Like what, Mr. Taylor?
J-Jefferson Smith.
No. What had you better--?
Oh--a wonderful thing--yes. Get you right in the mood--yes--yes.
Why, the Bill--the Bill--to make a National Boys' Camp...
I know--but you--you're going to help.
Right.
Tonight.
How?
Committee, huh?
Why?
Calendar?
Yes. Sure. What's a Steering Committee?
We're over in the House.
Now, let's get down to particulars. How big is this thing? Where is it to be? How many boys will it take care of? If they're going to buy it-- how do they make their contributions? Your Bill has to have all that in it--
But you've just taken care of the spirit all right.
Uh--getting back to this, Senator--
Now, this camp is going to be out in your state, of course--
Baltimore. Pure city-dweller.
Since sixteen or so.
No complaints.
Have I?
No!
In Terry Canyon?
No, I haven't. I guess I thought the name was familiar.  By the way, you discussed with Senator Paine where the camp was to be situated and everything?
Nothing. I just wondered. No *reason* to take it up with him.  "--about a quarter of a mile on either side of Willet Creek--"
One of the plagues on members of Congress--office-seekers, cranks, people with pet bills. Get my son into West Point--or *outta* West Point. I've got a scheme to put people to work. How do I get rid of cockroaches? Some woman's composed a hymn to replace the Star Spangled Banner. Want to hear it?
Contributions from boys who read about your camp.
Not another bill?
Saunders--
But--I've done everything I--
Saunders--if there was *any* way--
Hold on, fellows--I'm not used to more then one question at a time--
Well, we *must* see a lot of you, Senator. Come, Father.
How are the pigeons?
Goodnight, Senator--
Splendid.
Well--I--
"So help me God."
Oh--you're *sure* of that now?
Yes, *sir*.  Let's *go* Henry.
What do you mean? What's going on?
Jeff--meet Mr. Cook and Mr. Griffith-- members of our State headquarters here.
I've got 'im, Joe. Be right along.
Let's get away from here.
Listen--tomorrow I take him to see monuments--if I have to hit him over the head with a couple!
Shut up! You've *got* the man pilloried! Do you have to dance around him like a cannibal--!
I see. All right. You finish this job properly--and you get a handsome bonus besides--
Saunders--it's going to go pretty bad for Jeff tomorrow. There's only one thing that can be done for him now--  I--I've written his resignation. He resigns under protest--denying all charges. No one will ever be sure if he was guilty or not. It leaves him with at least a shred of honor. The other way--branded openly in the Senate--expelled--he'll never live it down. Rather a simple compromise than utter ruin. In a year--the whole thing might be forgotten--
Jim, you can't come here and pull that steamroller stuff. Your methods won't do here. This boy is a Senator, however it happened, he's a Senator. This is Washington.
I don't want any part of crucifying this boy.
It's crucifying him--!
Maybe he won't get up.
Sure! The fight's in the open now-- to a finish--!
Will Senator Smith yield to his colleague?
Page boys!
That's very nice of Mr. Cobb - but I don't want anybody sticking to my tail no matter what.
Some people like it.
Morning, neighbors. Morning.
Sometimes twice.
Sometimes he whistles.
Never can tell what he's going to do.
Always.
Yes, sir.
Would you like to go for a walk?
No!
No! I resigned last week!
It isn't all! I'd like to explain
Yes!!!
What happened?
Mmm, it tastes so good. Mr. Deeds, I don't know how I can ever thank you.
Oh - uh - nothing.
Oh. What's happening about the opera?
Uh-huh.
Huh?
That depends on what they see.
Yeah, I guess so. What puzzles me is why people seem to get so much pleasure out of hurting each other. Why don't they try liking each other once in a while?
What's that?
He did?
A girl?
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm crucifying him.
No - of course you don't. We've forgotten. We're too busy being smart-alecks.  Too busy in a crazy competition for nothing.
What else can I do? Keeping this up is no good. He's bound to find out sometime.  At least I can save him that .
Listen, Babe - get me some stuff on this guy, and you can have
I was the world's sweetest ingenue.
Had the boys follow us.
I don't know. I had to duck to get the story out. He was so far along he never even missed me.
Tonight, maybe.  I'll phone him at noon.  Oh, my lunch hour. I'm a stenographer, you know. Mary Dawson.
Oh, no. No. Our deal was for a month's vacation - with pay.
With pay!  She is out the door.
Oh, as bad as that, huh?
Babe ought to get him drunk again.
John
Yes, I know. A week's gone by and we haven't got the Power of Attorney yet!
Yes, sir.
Me, sir?
I wanna see that guy!
They say if it hadn't been for Deeds, they'd have gotten all the money.
Yes! Yes! Let's get on with it.
Sorry, Mac, I can't. Yeah, Mac. Sure, but I ain't the attorney
I'm not interested in the newspapers.
Yes. You see, rich people need someone to keep the crowds away. The world's full of pests. Then there's the newspapers to handle. One must know when to seek publicity - and when to avoid it.
Make three reservations on the first train out to Mandrake Falls, Vermont.
Yes.
All right.
Who - me? No.
That's very kind of you. Are you related to him?
Why should you?
Huh?
Oh, I don't mean that. I'm sure I'm going to need your help.
No, thanks.
Jim Mason?  Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, I didn't send it. I've got it written out, though. Here it is.  "Arthur's been with the Tallow Works too long. STOP. Don't think we should fire him. Longfellow."
Oh, I don't want to keep them waiting any longer. They're important people.  I wish you'd go along with me, Cobb. They're all strangers to me.
What're you talking about?
He's the shipping clerk at the Tallow Works. Wants a $2 raise - or he'll quit.
They can have the Estate.
Oh Yes, of course - you've just been elected.
I guess it is. But I personally wouldn't care to be head of a business that kept losing money. That wouldn't be common sense. Incidentally, where is the $180,000 coming from?
Me?!
Excuse me, gentlemen, there's nothing natural about that .
Uh-huh.
Let me alone!  If you know what's good for you - you'll let me get this off my chest!  How did you feel feeding doughnuts to a horse?  Get a kick out of it, huh? Got a big laugh?  Did you ever think of feeding doughnuts to human beings! No!
What kind of wife did you say she was?
You'll excuse me, won't you? I'll be right back.
What about it, Mr. Deeds?
One-third? That's about $7,000,000 isn't it?
Yes?
Be sure and point 'em out to me, won't you?
Now you keep out of this!
Christian Svenson.
Well, sir, he sometimes had as many as twenty in the house at the same time.
I'd venture to say, sir, you don't remember much of anything that happened last night, sir.
What two policemen?
Get out.  The evil finger's on you. Get out!
Anything happened? I've got to get dressed! I can't meet her like this!
Hmm?
One hundred books?
What happened?
Doubtful. What did he say?
No... a little. There's a lot of debate about it.
A friend?
It could happen. What about his state certification exams? The records seem to be in order.
Right now?
My approach?
Mr. Follett, do you trust me or don't you?
Stop now.
Now we're back on track.
What exactly is it supposed to do?
-- Which I don't necessarily agree.
There's absolutely no reason to think this is going to have any impact on you. I'm embarrassed to have --
Do you want to come in?
Mr. Gilroy --
I've had my moments.
Yes.
What?
Man, you see him a lot. And it's very wrong to reveal it. Next you'll be saying what his problem is.
Lily, I don't think even you could know that --
It's a pretty piece of land.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
...so accomplished.
That's it? That's what you're giving me?
Sure I can, Lionel.
See that sign -- We retain the right to refuse service to anyone. I'm not going to charge you for this session, but I don't want to see you back here.
You've got to have the right ladder for the job. You don't know what you're doing, you can get yourself in trouble.
Sure.
That would explain it.
Mumford... like the town?
-- the problem is you're a big fake. You haven't got a clue what's wrong with that girl.
Well, I gotta say, Mrs. Cook, you're right about that.
Oh, lord. It's almost too exhausting to tell you...  ...about my exhaustion. I didn't really want to come. I'm not hopeful right now. But I couldn't take the look on my dad's face. He's a truly kind person, which is pretty extraordinary if you knew the story. He's the opposite of me, I guess -- all stamina and resolve.
About six months ago, I guess it is now. God, it seems like years. What a bore! I'm embarrassed by it. Before this happened -- when I'd hear people talk about this kind of thing -- I thought it was a bunch of bullshit.
You think that now! You think it's a bunch of hooey, don't you?
Back when this started, was there anything unusual happening in your life? A change of job, of living situation... a loss of some kind?
Hmm.
I'll come to you. We'll try a little walking.
No one ever thought so. You must bring it out.
Maybe you'll catch it.
Maybe... but you're the one whose ass is dragging.
Is she against you getting help?
What?
Uh-huh.
Where?
In the capitol for Boy's Nation. Five days. Why?
That's what I like.
That's one way to put it.
I don't know if --
Of course.
Of course.
No, it is not something I've heard about you! It is someth--  Why? Is there something I should have heard about you?
I'm glad.
Which show was that?
Part of it. We were watching "ER" until someone called.
But...
I know it! Please believe me, I know that...
Will you wait for me?
Where was this?
You been spying on me in the supermarket, Nessa?
That's not quite what I said --
What do you want me to see?
He agreed?
Of course! That's exactly what I want.
This is exactly what I wanted.
Well, you know... that's the thing. Like I said, just about everybody in town works for me. And it's just not the same asking someone to throw a ball when they work for you. It's like an order or something... And no one -- no one -- asks me.
Did you know that Danny Ainge was drafted by the Blue Jays? Do you know what kind of athlete you have to be to play in the NBA and in the bigs?
Sexual surrogate... slash... companion.
I can tell you anything else.
It wasn't the best situation.
Didn't need one. We didn't even need a warrant for most of the shit we did. Man, the IRS... we could go in your bank account, your credit cards... hell, we used to go into doctors' files and get all the juicy details. Nobody wants to argue with the IRS.
Hey, you've done good. Look at yourself... you've cleaned up, you've got a career --
Harder than I thought. Took me three tries. But I was highly motivated -- figured there was no point in leaving me and taking that along. After two bomb-outs, I found a place in the desert...
Who'd you go with?  That's not good.
You know how easy it is. A kid can manage it if he wants a fake I.D. You can do practically the whole deal at your local Kinko's. The only variable is how much pride you take in the product.
English Lit.
I understand what it's like to want to leave a problem behind. That's all most people are looking to do.  Mainly, I listen.
See you Thursday... regular time.
Lily...  ...Skip, that's great! You and Lily.
Skip, you know that it's improper -- completely unethical -- for a licensed psychologist to carry on a romantic relationship with one of his patients?
What?
I don't even know why hang-gliding is considered a legitimate sport.
Are we talkin, about the same creature? The walking corpse? Really big mouth? Really bad breath?
Priests. Imhotep's priests.
By reading the Book Of The Dead.
And then killing your sister.
Did you say 'kill' my sister?
Exactly! I speak seven languages, including Hebrew, so my specialty was synagogues. How about you? Kill somebody?
None of the above, thank you.
Why do you like to fight so much?
Yeah, well, we all got our little problems today don't we?
It is better to be the right hand of the Devil,... than in his path. As long as I serve him, I am immune.
You shall see.
What does he want the book for?
Oh yes, always.
Yes. No one has ever had so much, been so close. We must stop her, or it will be the end of us all.
You will not believe it.
Yeah! It's supposed to be made outta pure gold!
What did you do to him!?
I am an English woman.
Proceed!
Yes and if you cut him down, we will give you ten percent.
Who cares? I don't see no treasure.
No.
Because that's where I found it. I was there.
You swear?
And the fact that they say it's made out of pure gold, makes no nevermind to you, right?
I know my treasure.
We're about to be shown the way.
You don't believe in curses, huh?
I know, you're wondering, what's a place like me doing in a girl like this?
Egypt is in my blood. My father was a famous explorer, he loved Egypt so much that he married an Egyptian. My mother! Who was quite an adventurer herself
Not unless you call me Rick.
No. I've never seen a mummy look like this. He's, he's still...
The ten plagues?... You mean all ten plagues.
FINE.
Got what?
Oh no, not another worthless trinket, Jonathan, if I bring one more piece of junk to the Curator to try and sell for you.
Picked his pocket, actually.
Don't blame me, I don't even remember being there.
Yes. He's more than four thousand years old and still decomposing.
Shut-up and get me off of here!
What's it look like!?
Yeah? Well,... I'm sure she's not a total loss.
I only gamble with my life, never my money.
We coulda had 'em for free, all we had to do was give 'em your sister.
Yes, I'm all tears, now let's see who's inside, shall we?
Ya know, ever since I met you, my luck has been for crap.
And then he'll be coming after Evy.
You have got to be joking?
Not quite. You haven't announced our engagement yet.
Head hunting.
Darling, you've got the wrong idea.
Do it, big boy!
Atta, boy!
But you're a superhero.
Me, too.
Let's do it.
Half a Dirty Dozen!
Sure.
Should I kill them?
Against.
Frankenstein!
Just a waitress.
I'm not that kind of girl.
You're a spy.
I saw him walk you home.
I guess... Are you always so angry?
Why?
Nothing wrong with being a waitress.
Are you nuts? Get out of there!
Yes.
Yes.
The wise snake coils before he strikes.
When are you going to take off that mask?
And smell a little funny. We're not bulletproof and we can't fly. But we're superheroes -- and that means doing what's right -- even when it's impossible... This is our city -- these are our friends, our families -- and if we don't save them, nobody will! So I say we take a ride up that hill, blast our way in there, destroy that Psycho-whatchamabob -- and teach those deviants a lesson they'll never forget!
LOOK!
I say we send out the word -- and summon all of the unsung superheroes we know!
How could I see him if he's invisible?
Yeah.
Because that's what it is.
With what?
But look at him... and look at us.
So you're chicken?
See ya tomorrow.
But we don't know for sure it's the same guy.
The most vicious gang of thugs this city ever produced. Twenty years ago they were Casanova's personal bodyguard. But after he was busted they crawled into the woodwork.
Come on.
Hey... he's gone.
We're superheroes.
Burgers all around.  Medium.  Rare.  Raw.
Jeffrey... this is wonderful.
I always knew that you were special.
With or without him, we gotta go!
I can appreciate what Your Majesty is saying but the Emperor has staked everything on this policy.  He has no other way to attack England, and no one knows more than Your Majesty how his overtures for peace have been rejected.
I have given a great deal of thought to that possibility, and I am prepared to face it.  If it should come to war, and I presume that is what you are alluding to, I would rather have war with the Emperor than my own people.
I have decided to accept the principle of a negotiation; the terms are not established.
For the sake of your argument, let us say that is correct.
Ah, yes -- proceed.
I have no doubt that he has, Your Majesty, but does he have any strong moves from which to choose?
Your Majesty has grasped the outlines of his problem in much less time than it took me.  This is a crucial point -- and it is a political one, which Your Majesty will be in a far better position to answer than I.  Can Napoleon afford to abandon Moscow without signing even the preliminaries of a peace treaty with you?
Yes, with all due respect, I do Citizen Barras.
May I come to the map?
What do you have in mind?
What forces do you have at your disposal?
You could have them here by daybreak.
Are you proposing to transfer command to me?
I don't know, sire -- she had the Tsar's personal physician.
That is incredible.
Bertrand, sire.
To Joseph Bonaparte -- Dear Joseph, I have been informed by my wife of the cold and spiteful treatment she has been receiving at the hands of my family, since my departure.  I am also informed that you have refused to pay over to her any of the money I left with you expressly for this purpose.  Must you, too, take this opportunity during my absence to indulge the petty jealousies of the Bonaparte family?
Come back in an hour.
Let me see it.
Yes, sir, I am.
Thank you, sir.
The first reports came in at about ten.
Oh?
I believe you issued an order that all citizens of Paris must hand over any weapons that they have in their possession.
I told the Lieutenant my late father was General Alexander de Beauharnais, and asked if there was any consideration that might be given to his memory.
My father's sword means more to me than any other possession I have.
I very much doubt that he will.
Yes, I am, sir.
One must take life as it comes -- do you live in Lyon, sir?
Would you like to take me there, so that we can get warm, sir?
Please, sir, come into bed or I shall die of a chill.
To Citizen General Bonaparte from one who does not wish to see him dishonored by his wife.  You should know, Citizen General, that your wife has taken a lover, one Captain Hippolyte Charles... undated and unsigned.
You would tell me, Joseph, wouldn't you?
You must not act impetuously.
But you can do the same thing in six months.  The next few weeks may be the most important ones in your life.
My dear Joseph, the only thing that is clear is that my wife is a slut -- and while a man may want a slut for his mistress, he does not want her for his wife.
Yes, we introduced ourselves at the door.
Oh, I don't want to put you to any inconvenience.
You are very kind, Madame de Beauharnais.  Do you have some sherry, perhaps?
Of course.
Open the door.  It's me.
I know what you're doing in there.
Five minutes.
It's me.
Now, just a minute.  You have just very clearly implied that there is a reason why Joseph should not give my wife the money which I left for her. I can't possibly allow a remark like that to go without explanation.
I couldn't face telling you.
My God, what do you think?
Yes.
No, Major, I merely wish to state that your vehicle appears to be somewhat slower and heavier than mine, and point out that, if you would be kind enough to pull over to one side of the road, I could pass you and be on my way.
Before you quote the rules of the road to me, Major, may I point out to you that you are not in France now, but that you are a guest in Russia.
Of course, my dear.
You may have anything you wish, my sweet and lovely Marie-Louise.
Of course, my dear -- how cruel to have been separated from her.  And how strange it must be for you to be here, away from your family and everything you know.
No.
What you are talking about is a gamble on moderation -- when I gamble, I prefer to gamble on force.
Yes, sir.
My mother has always loved me.  She would do anything for me.
Life is a burden for me.  Nothing gives me any pleasure; I find only sadness in everything around me.  It is very difficult because the ways of those with whom I live, and probably always shall live, are as different from mine as moonlight is from sunlight.
From that moment on, I foresaw what I might be.  Already I felt the earth flee beneath me, as if I were being carried away up to the sky.
Duroc, I have a bill here for 600,000 francs from Tirot, for building the Imperial throne and six decorated arm-chairs.  The amount is absurd -- and, at least twice too much.
If the French army had been commanded at Jena and Auerstadt by a tailor, the King of Prussia would certainly have gained the day.
Thanks, Unc.
Yeah.
Good.
Why you say that?
I'm his cousin.
What happen?
Not me.
Come on, Day, try it.  For moms.
What about the dog?
Cheeco.
You.  Hi, Uncle Willie.
I know, we had a good time.  But ever since you guys moved out here, it seems like we've lost touch.
Naw, them dudes is assholes.  Especially that dog - Cheeco.  Watch this little ass, he's sneaky.  Plus, I got something better than a Cadillac.
Man, after taxes, lawyer fees, and paying off my daddy's bad credit, we didn't end up with a million.  We bought this house and I spent the rest on this.  It's the bomb, huh?
Thanks for reminding me.
Man, it's a long story.  I met D'Wana three months ago.  She had a little pudge in her stomach but I didn't pay it no attention.  Come to find out, she six months pregnant.  Saying I'm the daddy!
That ain't the worst part.  Her little sister, Baby D.  She's the one that gets real physical.  But I got a restraining order on her, too.
Because, it's been a little tension between us ever since they got out the joint and ran their momma crazy.  And I'm just trying to keep the peace.  We moved out here to get away from that shit.
That ain't gonna work.
I didn't see nothing.
Wait for what?
Oh yeah, why you walking?
I don't know.
Hell yeah, I remember you.
Better sooner than later.
What are you doing here?
It's locked.
So what?  Let's make'em wait.
Well bring yo' ass on...
Smells like you didn't fall in no mud.
It's alright.
Well, then, it's all good.  Yo, Day-Day, something is going down with those Mexicans across the street?  I've been seeing a lot of activity.
Sir, the manager stepped out for a moment.  I'm currently running the store. Can I see the CD?
Yeah, it was.  How you get up here?
You don't wanna know.
Damn nigga, don't Jack the joint.  I didn't even pass it.
Maybe you can ask him to loan you the money.
Where's Craig?
Go for it.
And some rolling papers.
Thanks for the help.
Shhhh!  Roach, shut the fuck up.
I don't know, Debo.
He moved out to Rancho Cucamonga with his cousin Day-Day.
What?
Good, let's get out.
I don't know.
Hey!  I said I'll take your fuckin' ass later.  Now get out of here.  You're scaring our company.
Shut yo' ass up.
The skills are still intact.  Now tie his ass up, Elroy.
I threw my back, again.
What happened here?
Come on, El, you're a trooper. I'll get you some Pepto, you'll make one of your patented tributes to the common person, then back to Sacramento. This is no time to lay down on the job. I don't care what the polls say, you can't afford to relax. Look what happened to Bush. Tell you what, if you want to blow off the Sacramento speech, fine. But do this one and we'll get out of the smog.
That's my girl.
San Diego.
Oh, yeah?
My security people are right next door.
One loud scream will bring them in here instantly. You won't get very far. Think it over.
Don't worry. She's good with kids.
What's your point?
Yes, you will, Mr. Watson.
At one thirty my little girl is dead.
Of course you're invited. You're a big donor to the campaign. They love you.
Then I have time for a drink.
You've got to trust me. I'm putting my daughter's life in your hands. She's only six. She's just a little girl. Please, please, trust me.
He'll think you're in the crowd until the end of the speech. Wait a minute.
Trust me. You asked me for help. Let me help. Trust me.
Right.
Over and out.
I'm tired. I want to.go now.
No, kisses to...
Sure. Go down past the bar. Take you right out there.
The Governor. If I could just talk to her...
Hi.
What!?
It'll come to you. See if you can stop this thing 'fore it gets started. Save us all considerable embarrassment.
No, I know I don't want it cleaned. Get out of here.
It's already done. I've already done it. You have to pay me now.
You're going to deny me a lousy dollar after I've sweated like a pig giving you the gift of a clean windsheild?
I think this is worth a dollar.
I see. Where is this gun?
No, I didn't. I confiscated it. There's a difference.
Everybody does?
My daddy is going to be a hero? Like Power Rangers?
You're a big girl, huh?
It better be.
Shut up.
You' oughta learn to relax. I told you I've got it under control.
Keep your eyes peeled.
Young love.
Yeah.
No.
Tryin' to make me talk about it in my sleep!
I'll bet.
Not even her?
Ain't nobody stole Dad's skiff.
When'll Dad's skiff be ready?
But which one of you can say as I can say: I drove a good man to murder because I kept a-houndin' him for clothes and per-fumes and face paint!
So you ain't with the State no more?
May the Lord have mercy on you, Walt Spoon!
All to pieces!
Bluebeard!
Tricked us!
John don't like him much.
There's something else.
It's a shame!
Mister Powell!
Amen.
Hm?
John! Don't!
John, don't be mad! Don't be mad! I was just playing with it! I didn't tell no one!
We'll steal somethin' to eat.
Hush, Pearl. Come on.
Is that all?
You think you can make me tell! But I won't! I won't! I won't!
Pearl's junk. Mom gets mad when she plays out here and don't clean up afterward.
I don't know nothin'!
In the cellar. Buried under a stone in the floor.
What secret shall I tell?
Tst-tst! Then I reckon I'll have to try again! Where's the money hid?
Tell me another secret about my Dad.
Because John said I mustn't.
I reckon it's been ordained this way, Brother Spoon.
He don't mean no impudence; do you, boy?  Do you, boy? Ah, many's the time poor Brother Ben told me about these youngins.
Well, John, the night before your father died, he told me what he did with that money.
I was praying.
Yes.
It's about that John and that Pearl?
My flesh and blood!
What?
I sure as hell hope so.
Yeah. Something slippery all over here...  Tina?
Okay, okay.  I think.
Just checking -- keep out of sight!
Yeah.
I heard your ma went ape at the security store today. You look like the Prisoner of Zenda or something. How long's it been since you slept?
You heard me. I grab him in the dream -- you see me struggling so you wake me up. We both come out, you cold cock the fucker, and we got him. Clever, huh?
Dad, I want to see Rod Lane.
You don't know he did it.
Deal.
Oh, Jesus -- Nancy!  Hey! We got a fire!
Something like a razor was the weapon, but nothing found on the scene.
Uh, she just saw you, sir...
I'll sleep in study hall, promise. I'd rather keep busy, you know?
Right.
I don't think you're going crazy -- and stop drinking that damn coffee!
Nobody's gonna kill you.
You were screaming like crazy.
No.
Have you any money?
Thank you, Comrade, thank you.
A few friends... just a little dinner party.
I haven't talked to anyone about Paris. I haven't said a word.
You mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day?
All right, let's uphold it for another ten minutes.
He's a bad man. Sends people to Siberia!
Possibly.
Imagine! The niece of the Czar opening the door for us.
Or it might be the firing squad!
That's right.
If you asked him why he left France I bet he couldn't name one good reason.
...des raisins de Madère, des framboises...
I know, but if we can't put in all these wonderful things at least let's put in some imagination.  In that one omelet we'll taste the whole of Paris!
Imagine, we don't have to whisper any longer.
What is it?
Yes, he looks like a comrade!
That's right... and we might as well face it.
No, that's bad management.
Monsieur.
Well, gentlemen, I'm afraid our rates are rather high.
Which part of the room is mine?
Huh?... Why don't you get a haircut, Buljanoff? You all look so wintry, Comrades. And why do we always keep the windows closed?  Isn't it amazing, at home there's still snow and ice and here... Look at the birds. I always felt a little hurt that our swallows deserted us in the winter for capitalistic countries. Now I know why. We have the high ideal but they have the climate... well, Comrades, I don't think I need you any more.
Don't worry... there will be enough.
Well, if your mother turns against you, you have to look for someone to adopt you.
That's all right.
Go to bed.
No, sir.
No, sir.
Yes.
These may have been the jewels of the Duchess Swana, but, like all private property, they were confiscated by the State.
Soviet Russia will put all its might behind this case.
We avoided luxury and extravagance and today... well, if you were to offer us a glass of champagne, we wouldn't say no.
My name is Count d'Algout. I telephoned.
Oh, no, no. I am not a highwayman, I'm just a nuisance. All I'm trying to do is make things as difficult as possible.
If we say that, Leon... we'll be sent to Siberia!
She doesn't leave her room! She has been locked in for the last two days with lawyers and law books!
Don't make an issue of my womanhood. We are here for work... all of us. Let's not waste time. Shall we go?
No, not a thing. Would you like to go out?
And it's great! Think what it was a few years ago and what it is now.
The hearing is set for the twentieth of this month.
Au revoir.
Or a tunnel or a bridge...
Me?
What?
How long does it take a man to land?
I'll try.
A Russian! I love Russians! Comrade... I have been fascinated by your Five- Year Plan for the past fifteen years!
I will do my best.
Yes.
It helps. It has ever since King David wooed Bathsheba with the harp. As I am not so fortunate as to have my harp at hand, I shall turn on the radio.
For mankind not a thing -- for womankind the record is not quite so bleak.
Ninotchka, do you like me just a little bit?
Thank you.
Your cornea is terrific. Tell me -- you're so expert on things -- can it be that I'm falling in love with you?
What can I possibly do to encourage such an impulse in you?
It's false sentimentality.
Ninotchka, or shall I say Special Envoy Yakushova...
You know I want to...
Send me a plate of raw carrots and beets, beets predominating on a ratio of sixty-forty... What? There is a strike in the kitchen? Good! Will you assure the strikers of my hearty sympathy in their cause. I hope they will not weaken in their demands and tell them to put no dressing whatsoever on my vegetables... What? You won't serve me either? Now look here, Comrade, I think it is a fine idea to let the capitalists go without luncheon but when you keep food away from me you're weakening the people.
I don't like your following me.
But you have now, and I know now that you are a man who employs business methods which in Russia would be punished by death.
What?
Why?
No.
Leon, I want to tell you something which I thought I never would say, which I thought nobody ever should say, because I thought it didn't exist... and, Leon... I can't say it...
I promise... I swear.
Ninotchka, you're jealous.
My darling.
It's always good luck to launch something with champagne; a battleship... or an evening.
There have been cases... but the headache the next morning is worth while -- if you drink it with the right toast.  To us, Ninotchka!
And General Savitzky.
No, darling. I'll tell you another story, a much better one.  The only thing that will be over on Thursday is the lawsuit. There will be no Thursday for us. Not next week or any week. We won't let it happen. I'll tear it out of the calendar. Is that a good story?
You must, darling.
What, darling?
Shhh! Shhh!
Comrades! Good people of France!
Right: Lovers of the world unite!
Let's turn on the radio.
It's a little box that you buy on the installment plan and before you tune it in they tell you they have a new model.
No, no news. We don't want to know what's happening in the world. We want to be left alone, don't we?
Well, then we turn twice to the right and stop at seven...
Yes, sweetheart.
If you don't stay with me, I'll have to continue my fight. I'll travel wherever Russian commissions are. I'll turn them all into Buljanoffs, Iranoffs, and Kopalskis. The world will be crowded with Russian restaurants. I'll depopulate Russia. Once you saved your country by going back. This time you can save it by staying here.
We can forget horse racing, roulette, the stock market... our worries are over! You remember that platinum watch with the diamond numbers? You will be in a position to give it to me.
Now, Swana...
Rakonin, bless him, has given me the most amazing news!
No.
Not in your condition.  Make it tepid, Gaston... tepid and tender. And lay out his gray suit.  Afterwards I'll drive you through the Bois. Slowly... in Waltz time.
Well... er... I caught a glimpse of her when she walked through the lobby.
Darling, if we're going to get anywhere someone has to keep his eyes open!
It's a dream of beauty. He never takes my word for anything, but I was right, wasn't I?
No... please...
Count d'Algout was for several years my personal representative and if it is necessary to sign any affidavit for him I'll be delighted.
Dear me... I must be losing my finesse. If I'm not careful I'll be understood by everybody.
I told you to go, madame.
Don't worry. Fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open. Perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a Russian.  I just put this on for sentiment. The rest are absolutely safe. I assure you. But if you feel like notifying the police...
In other words moral ideas have no weight with you... all right, then let's deal with legal facts. You know that France has recognized the Soviet.
That's no business... that's a social injustice.
Yes, it does.
It gives details which couldn't be invented. Naturally I want to verify it and that's why I need you.
I don't understand.
Where is that?
Where is it?
My jewels?!
Why do you bring this up after so many years?
They can't impeach me for bombing Cambodia.  The President can bomb anybody he wants.
Then tell Richardson to fire him.
You did say it, sir.
You don't need to check the tape.  I know what I said.
What?
No, we have nothing to hide.
In Richard Nixon's long history of underhanded dealings, he has never gotten better value for his money.  If I were to open my mouth, all the dominoes would fall.
'Cause he hates you.  It's worse when you get it from someone you trust.
Yeah?
Mitchell?
No, sir.
Is the war worth it?  Is it worth a one-term presidency?  Because I think right now that's what we're looking at.
Yeah, good old Spiro.  Well, better him than me.  What the hell is he but an insurance policy?
Forget it.  Ehrenberg's paid three times that much ...
And what am I supposed to do?  Just sit here and watch them coming closer? Eating their way to the center?  Lyndon bugged!  So did Kennedy!  FDR cut a deal with Lucky Luciano. Christ, even Ike had a mistress! What's so special about me?  What about Lyndon?  He could make a couple of calls to the Hill and shut this whole thing down.  Did anyone talk to him?
It's marked.  Also there's June twenty third.  And this year -- March twenty first.  Those are the ones ...
Can the president afford to ignore a subpoena?
I'm afraid we have another problem, Mr. President.
Lincoln used it.
That's right ...
I know it well, sir.
Definitely.  Colson had him trying to break into Bremer's apartment after Bremer shot Wallace, to plant McGovern campaign literature.
We were working on China.
That's right, and it's more a problem for Ehrlichman.  He fixed Hunt up with the phony CIA ID's, but ... what else does Hunt have on us?
I'll talk to Helms.  Oh, Pat asked if you're coming to the Residence for dinner tonight.
Yes, sir.  I'll talk to Helms, and, uh ... what's our press position on this Watergate thing?  What do I tell Ziegler to tell them?
He wouldn't do the makeup.  Said it was for queers.
I, unlike Senator Kennedy, have a plan to end the war.  But not for peace at any price, but peace with honor!
What?  That he knew Johnny Roselli? Hoover knew a lot of gangsters.
I tell you, the soldiers were provoked.  Now stop this pussyfooting around.  Dead kids!  How the hell did we ever give the Democrats a weapon like this?  I mean, if Cambodia doesn't work, we'll bomb Hanoi if we have to.
No ... a little deficit won't hurt. Jesus, they're serious.  Why're we stopping?
Probably flunking, nothing to do except come down here and meet girls. Henry's out there with them.
It's okay, Bob, we're just rapping, my friends and I.  We actually agree on a lot of things ...
Don't forget, the most important thing in your life is your relationship with your Maker ...  Don't forget to be on God's side.
What?
Yes, Mother ...
What about happiness, Mother?
My friends call me "Mister President."
Then find something.  And I want these leaks stopped.  Jack fucking Anderson, the New York Times, the State Department -- I want to know who's talking to them.
Screw congressional oversight.  I know damn well, going back to the '50's, this agency reports what it wants, and buries what it doesn't want Congress to know.  Pay close attention to this.
Yes ...
My job, unpleasant sometimes, is to know what others don't want me to know.
It is not my practice to spy on the president.  Doctor Kissinger manages to convey his innermost secrets to the world at large on his own.
Flowers are continual reminders of our mortality.  Do you appreciate flowers?
He's lying, Clyde.  Always has. That's why Nixon's always been useful. Hold still.  And take your hand off your hip.
Edgar, think twice.  He works in the kitchen.
Would you walk with me down to the paddock?  I'd like to look at the horses for the eighth.
Turn this crap off, Clyde.  It's giving me a headache ... You may go, Joaquin.
Yes.  Your old friend from Cuba.
I know you've been very careful not to.  That's why I'm concerned.
It could be '60 all over again, Edgar. Bobby's got the magic, like a goddamn rock star.  They climb all over each other just to touch his clothes! He'll ride his brother's corpse right into the White House.
Don't listen to 'em, don't quit. Remember - Kennedy, Bobby, and King were against the war.  Where are they now?  Don't give 'em a goddamn inch on the war.  President Johnson bombed Laos for years and nobody knew or said a thing.  How the hell the Times ever got ahold of this Ellsberg stuff is a disgrace!
Johnson had the same damned problem till he bugged his own office.
That was a mistake.  The White House was full of Kennedy people then.  It still is.
Well, you have CIA people all over the place.  Helms has seen to that.  Then there's Kissinger's staff. Kissinger himself, I believe, maybe the leaker.
He's obsessed with his own image.  He wants his Nobel Peace Prize a little too much.  As the late "Doctor" King proved -- even an ape can win a prize with good press.
No one.  Your property.  It would prove your case.  Why do you think Kissinger's taping your calls?  For history.  His word against yours -- and right now he's got the records.
The White House.
Just don't tell him to do anything you don't really want him to do.
Remember -- listen up!  Fire team discipline is there at all times. Keep your radios on at all times during the entire penetration.  Check yourselves.  Phony ID's, no wallets, no keys.  We rendezvous where?  The Watergate, Room 214.  When?  At zero three-hundred.
Agreed.
The American people put me where I am.
He was, he was.  We taught a class together at Harvard.  But you know these back-stabbing Ivy League intellectuals, they can't ...
But they all got it back again, didn't they?  We should have lunch sometime.
I didn't ask what your staff thinks, Henry.  What do you think?
No one understands! -- even my own men.  What do you think the Communists respond to?  Honesty, liberal guilt, soul-wringing crap, fathers on TV crying?  Hell no!  I understand the Communist mind, I've studied it for thirty years.  They grasp "realpolitik" better than any of us, right, Henry?
I ... I heard something ... It sounded idiotic.
I had nothing to do with that, sir, and I resent any implication ...
Don't be stupid.  The world needs you, Henry; you always saw the big picture. You were my equal in many ways.  You're the only friend I've got, Henry.
Fung pi!   I've only managed to change a few things around the city of Beijing.  I want to know your secret.
Just ... uh ... you know.
That was Mr. Kennedy.
Did you cry when he died?
Mr. Chairman, there is an old saying: The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
You just came down here for the weather, right, Mr. Nixon?
But I wouldn't have if Hiss hadn't lied about knowing Chambers.  The documents were old and out of date, like these Pentagon Papers.  The key thing we proved was that Hiss was a liar.  Then people bought it that he was a spy.  It's the lie that gets you.
Talks all day, too!  How the hell can you put up with her, John?
How do you know that, John?  Did we try?  Are we just giving up like the rest of 'em?  What's Hoover found, for God's sake?
They were throwing rocks, John, just rocks.  They don't think I feel ... but I feel too much sometimes.  I just can't let a whole policy get dominated by our sentimentality.
... but it was all we had.
Syracuse.
That man up there lived in similar times.  He had chaos and civil war and hatred between the races ... Sometimes I go to the Lincoln Room at the White House and just pray.  You know, the liberals act like idealism belongs to them, but it's not true.  My family went Republican because Lincoln freed the slaves.  My grandmother was an abolitionist.  It was Quakers who founded Whittier, my hometown, to abolish slavery.  They were conservative Bible folk, but they had a powerful sense of right and wrong ... Forty years ago I was looking, as you are now, for answers.  But you know, ending the war and cleaning up the air and the cities, feeding the poor -- my mother used to feed hobos stopping over at our house - none of it is going to satisfy the spiritual hunger we all have, finding a meaning to this life ...
She must be very attractive.  Would she like an autograph?  She might remember me ... Where's Trini?
Yes, I understand that.
I know ...
It's not fair, Buddy.  I can take the insults; I can take the name-calling. But I can't take the losing.  I hate it.
Not that.  Us.
No, I'm not!  I'm finished.
That's what you said the first time we met.  You didn't even know me.
Is that the truth?
Why don't we go down to Key Biscayne together?  Just the two of us.
Then what are you scared of, honey?
You personally?
How am I going to break this to Bob Hope?
Ron told me that Bob Haldeman's been calling.  But you won't talk to him ... if he's convicted, will you pardon him?
Lost.
The Republican Party was never home to extremists.  You should know better. This guy's as stupid as McCarthy, and McCarthy never did you any good in the long run, now did he?
No, but I liked your book on nuclear weapons.  We have similar views on the balance of power ...
You lookin' at it. I got to say you look older.
Most don't.
No ID in her room?
Yes, he has some hard bark on him.
You ain't heard from him?
Nothin'?
If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed, you promise it'll be just you goes and talks with him -- you and nobody else?
You sure?
That's possible.
Gun out and up.
I'm ahead of you there.
Wasn't no bullet.
There's a question. Whether they stopped bein'. And when.
My lord, Wendell, it's just all-out war. I  don't know any other word for it. Who are these folks? I don't know...
That DEA agent called again. You don't want to talk to him?
Yes Sheriff.
I can't plan your day.
Well I didn't see it.
I ain't got the money.
No. But I gave my word.
No. I found it.
What? Quit hollerin'.
You don't need to know everthing, Carla Jean.
You keep running that mouth I'm gonna take you in the back and screw you.
Goin' out.
Why would we go to Odessa?
Well -- how come?
C'mon, pack your things. Anything you leave you ain't gonna see again.
I'm gonna borrow a car. From Eldon.
Yes I do.
I shall return.
You know what's goin' on?
No. This works better. With you gone and I don't have the money, he can't touch me. But I can sure touch him. After I find him I'll come and join you.
She'll be all right.
I'm looking for Llewelyn Moss.
Is Llewelyn there?
In the truck.  I'll get it.
Huh? Airport or airstrip?
Just lightin' out for the territories, huh. Brother, I been there... Well...
No. Do you?
He feels... he felt... the more people looking...
Now is not a time. What time do you close.
Sir?
You said that.
I don't have some way to put it. That's the way it is.
Sir?
There's somebody lookin' for me. Not police. Just call me if anyone else checks in tonight.
Why don't I set you down here and we won't argue about it.
How well do you know Chigurh.
You can have the one next to yours if you want. One twenty.  It ain't took.
What else then?
I know, I've seen him. Sort of.
I know what it is. He won't find me again.
Yes.
Yeah. I was in Nam.
Yes sir.
Yes sir. Two tours.
It's a type of altered state... it allows a traumatized person to continue functioning.
I was saying that it seems probable that she witnessed the murder, but her memory of it is gone, at least for the time being. I also think you ought to have her stay with someone tonight.  Any idea who Chloe or Lonnie are?
Oh, you know, the usual... keeping the world safe.
C'mon, Betty, open up! I got some questions for you about...
No, it's nothing, I... my piranha just mauled me a little when I layed their food out.
I can't... they prefer a more formal presentation. I don't usually go so close to the surface, but I was...
Yeah?
That's it! YOU'RE GONE!
Worry about your own goddamn lunch!
She said she was in Arizona, did she?
Fuck you, Roy Ostrey!
YOU shut up!  They're beautiful, but get them some water.
I'm not going out there! Let's wait for the real police...
No, no, no... you don't know shit about procedure! You don't send your best...
This is Roy Ostrey, he's a reporter. And this is Sheriff Ballard. We all went to Fair Oaks High together...
Drugs? God, no! I'm totally against drugs.
...to see you.
Umm, I don't think that...
I don't feel that, no. I just... I'm not really who you think I am.
I know. I borrowed it from your grandparents because I... I... it doesn't matter. Don't worry, they're fine...  Look, I used to feel that same way, said practically those same words, sitting at night in a foxhole in Korea...  I've chased you across the country, Betty, and I come to find out we're a lot more alike than you'd think.
This is really awkward...
Yes... Not the actor, though, the doctor. I think.
What?
Are you and Larry happy?
All the time...
What are you talking about?
The day I left you I just drove and drove. I drove all day and all that night, and I didn't go anywhere. I just kept driving. I stopped at a little country church, and the pastor let me in, and I sat --
You're late, Eric.
Alright, okay... I think you broke the record for staying in character about three hours ago.
At last! I know how much you want this. You're gifted and extremely determined, but... it's not up to me.
Ad lib?
...What? What did you call me? George... McCord. You're my favorite actor on...
My treat. You were saying... something about how stupid you've been?
Mmm-hmm. Listen, I forgive you, Mr. McCord...
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hang on a second there, baby. Why do you need one of the new Buicks?
What's so special about it?
Oh, I know.  So, who're these clients?
My God... did you get a look at who did it?
Really?
What's his real name?
You mean... George McCord, the actor?
LISTEN TO ME! IF I DON'T DO THIS, HE'S DEAD!
I'm not. I just drove in from Kansas.
'David.' That's your guy. So, you staying with him?
No, that's not, I couldn't...
He has a wife?!
Her 'head'?! You're making this up...
David isn't hiding from me, I left him standing at the altar six years ago and now I'm...
If you didn't want to do it, you should have said so! Is this about gas money?
I helped you because I'm an idiot! Ask my mother, I love it when people take advantage of me! I TRUSTED YOU!! I THOUGHT HE WAS REAL!
Fine.
Oh, God! You scared me! Yes...
Andersonville.  They did horrible things to men there...
Of what?
The Indians, Injuns, whatever. They're always drunk and doing stupid things.
That's what I thought.  You better give me another example.
He told us it's in the Buick.
Should I kill him now?
We don't. But a '97 Le Sabre'll be easy to find if it's here, town this size...  He said he gave his wife some car as a gift, remember?
Like... us?
Well, then, did you ever get any indication that she wanted to leave her husband?
You're always so coarse... "Do her right here." Let's just see what happens, okay?  "I wish that I could find a way; To speak my thoughts on Mother's Day. There are no words that quite express; My gratitude or happiness. A pleasant smile perhaps a kiss; I would not fail to give her this. I'd make her glad the whole day through; By sayin' 'Mother', I love you!' P.S. I wish I could say this to my mother's face, but I can't anymore."
...She's got class, and poise. Lots of poise...
I'm sick of looking at her mother- fucking face.
No.
No... be dark before we get there. You wanna see the Grand Canyon at night?
I said, 'No.' N-O.
Do you hear yourself right now...? Like a fucking madman...
Maybe she had to use the bathroom. She pees, doesn't she?!...
I dunno, that lady sounded pretty sure...
I need to get my goddamn head examined.  You can't rule something out on a whim. Or because she's cute. I've been following your whims all across the U.S. of A. and now I'm tired! Me!
...yeah, I got it.  Come on, you're stretching out my vest...
It's to follow my instincts. And my instincts say get the fuck out of Dodge.
Very graceful. Perfect form.
Huh? Oh, umm, a car.  So, to a successful transaction...
Yeah, well, I don't have time to screw around. I got buyers in Dallas, Houston and Vegas who are ready to snap this stuff up.
No, wait... what happened next, Betty?
I'll think about it.
I SAID FORGET IT!
Oh, yeah... Man, I'd love to find that actor just to see the look on her face, watch her bubble burst in mid-air.
Totally. She came apart like a house of cards. They dropped the charges...
Once again we find ourselves in agreement.  What kind of work do you do, Big Dan?
Our pleasure, Big Dan.
Waitaminute -
How ya been, Wash? Been what, twelve, thirteen year'n?
You mis'able little sneak thief...
Yeah, it stinks in that ol' barn.
No, they never did turn me into a toad.
Don't know, Delmar-though the blind are reputed to possess sensitivities compensatin' for their lack of sight, even to the point of developing para- normal psychic powers. Now clearly, seein' the future would fall neatly into that ka-taggery. It's not so surprising, then, if an organism deprived of earthly vision-
What'd the devil give you for your soul, Tommy?
Four hundred, Delmar.
I left my pomade in that car! Maybe I can creep up!
Now you may call it an unreasoning optimism. You may call it obtuse. But the plain fact is we still have... close to... close to...
Okay, Everett.
I never knocked over any armored- car. I was sent up for practicing law without a license.
Boys, we was chained together. I hadda tell ya somethin'. Bustin' out alone was not a option!
Honey, it's just - Shutup, Delmar - it's just -
Aw, don't be ignorant, Delmar. I told you they was gonna flood this valley.
Oh, yes, assa parful new force.
Vernon T. Waldrip.
Now Penny, stop that!
...Why you... lyin,... unconstant... succubus!
The hell you say! Wash is kin!
Now hold on, Pete, we gotta speak with one voice here - CAREFUL WITH THAT FIRE NOW, BOYS!
Sell that. I figured it could only have painful associations for Wash.
It was in his bureau.
Pete, don't be ignorant-
Isn't it, uh...
Damnit, I just hadda bust out! My wife wrote me she was gettin' married! I gotta stop it!
I couldn't wait two weeks! She's gettin' married tomorra!
Eighty-four years old! I'll be gummin' pab-you-lum!
I am. Hur you?
Well that all depends. You boys do Negro songs?
Well people like that reform. Maybe we should get us some.
Great.
To fly jets. To be the fastest motherfucker in the world. You gotta come and visit me. I'm only a couple hours away.
From you, pard? Never. Thanks for the graduation present.
I never said any of that!
Ever heard of knocking, mayo?
Come over here where I can see you.
Not exactly, sir.
I'm doing okay, sir.
Pity you don't have the character.
Not a fucking chance, asshole!
Aw screw it...
I'll never forget you as long as I live, Sergeant.
Yeah. See you in the fleet, Sarge. And thank you.
How're you doing, Sarge?
I called you Sarge.
I didn't call you anything before that.
Zack, don't!
Yes, sir!
Yes, sir!!
Yes, sir!
I said, come here!
But you knew right off what I was talking about, didn't you, Paula! Did you let that boy --
Cake walk. Both my dad and my brother went through it and made it, so I know I can.
He was. He died.
Don't worry. I'll respect you afterwards.
I'm a little late, that's all.
What do you care? Suppose I was pregnant. Just suppose it. You don't think I'd try to make you do anything you don't want to, do you?
That's right. Let's get married, Lynette. Let's find a justice of the peace and just do it!
Well, I'll be goddamned.
Great.
What do you mean?
No way... Would you?
Really?
Not me.
To meet interesting people, improve myself. You wouldn't believe the losers we got over in Port Angeles.
Opening up just a little wouldn't kill you, ya know.
I'll get it if you want.
I don't want to move. But somebody has to move sometime. Eventually.
What's stopping you?
God.
Hey, will you just leave me alone?
Zack, I don't know if I want to do that...
No, it's okay. It was a great free meal. Everybody was so uptight I felt sorry for you.
Why'd he do it?
That's brilliant.
Who's got two bucks? It's costing me every penny they pay us just to keep my old Lady and my kids in that motel.
I can't risk it.
Hey, Sid, thanks.
Yeah. All week long.
Shhhh...
Sure.
Naw.
I didn't ask you all that, Sweet Pea. I asked if you loved her.
No matter how it happened, if she goes ahead and has it" Zack, there'll be a child in the world that's mine -- and I couldn't go through life knowing that and not knowing its name or where it lived.
I don't get it! He's the best candidate in our class! Ask anyone! The best student! The best leader! The best friend to everybody! Couldn't you bend your goddamn standards just a little?
Who else but God could think this shit up?  I spend ten years building those fucking rooms to keep people out, now I gotta figure out how to get in.  God, man, He just loves the irony.
Who's the clown now?  Huh?!  Who's the fucking clown now?!
Remember that.
This is ridiculous...
Okay, okay!  Okay.
Yeah.  Yeah, I got an idea.  I gotta check something.
You're here with me, you're already on the hook for one.  Buy one, you get the rest for the same price. You know that.
Not that one.
That's why the key didn't work, they changed the locks.
She'll call the cops, they'll be here before I get unpacked.
I met him at the tables, same as you.  And frankly, I'm grateful we have a little muscle right about now.
Different tables.
Pure idiot.
We're trying to scare them, not kill them!
Shit!
Do me a favor and don't talk.
Lookin' doubtful there, Big Guy, but ten out of ten for attitude.
Everything okay?
KID!  NO ELEVATOR!
It's quite in vogue in high end construction right now.  One really can't be too careful about home invasion.
Reinforced steel core walls.  Buried phone line, completely separate, not connected to the house's main line and never exposed throughout the house's infrastructure or outside the house -- you can call the police; nobody can cut you off. Your own ventilation system, complete with oxygen scrubber, so you've got plenty of fresh air for as long as you like.  And a bank of video monitors --
A safe room.  An inner sanctum.  A castle keep, in medieval times.
I said open the door.
It's okay, Raoul.
I'm just saying, the man is a problem.  And he's your problem. Wasn't me idea to bring him along.
He puts his hands on me again I'll bury a slug in his ear.
The hell we are.
Why?
Open the door.
0150.
PANIC ROOM!
What do they want?
They can't.  They can't get in here. No.  They can't.
Feel okay?
I'm here.  I'm here.
Dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot dot.
Yeah, but where's the third guy?
No.
Blue is phones?
Uh uh.
He won't even know who it was.
I'm dizzy, not deaf.
I have confirmed to you my address, that's all I'm required to by law to do. We have broken no law.
That's just it Huey. The pigs don't know how many Panthers there are. Both of us show and they might start putting 2 and 2 together. We're not even two hundred strong yet... but we got 'em guessing thousands.
Yeah.
What's with you?
Yeah, it's me.
Shut up. Just shut the fuck up.
Shit, I ain't doing nothing. White bread asks for cocaine, I take his money. Shit... you know... It was just a hustle.
Look this is bull...
Cy... I ain't even sure.
It's a bit more like how can we help you. Bay Area's become quite a hornet's nest in terms of subversive activities. And... well Mr. Hoover wants to reiterate that the FBI will be happy to assist local authorities in any way we can. On a strictly advisory basis... of course.
Are you finished?
...no full fledge alliance. But I think we should do a rally with them. Show that there's some common ground between Black and White. You all with that?  All right then Eldridge, set it up.
I refuse to answer the question on the grounds it might incriminate me.
Again I'll take the fifth amendment on that question.
Not good enough Rodgers. Not good enough at all. Black terrorists on the floor of a State Capitol. I will not say this again, these Negro Commies are to be stopped and now. You tear them down. Either from the outside or the inside.
Work harder. And get me some results. Those Black Bastards could be up to anything.
Rallying cry, it's an insurrection. Seale, that god damned Cleaver, Where the hell do these guys come from?
We're like policing the police.
So talk...
Get the brothers a beer. Me too while you're at it.  Men? Well we can spare six for security...
A gun's a gun man. It don't need to be loaded.
You fit the profile, Brother. You look exactly like the kind of nigger they think they can trust...
Me too. That's why I fight so hard.
And who is we?
Maybe...
Yeah, "brother" My best friend is stone dead.
Later for that. I'm done either way...
Judge man. Watch yourself. Sabu's got juice now.
Lord, never thought I'd live to see my boy in prison.
Mom, black folks been praying to God for four hundred years. Maybe it's time we tried something else...
It's alright.  I'm very happy for you.
Thank you.
You call that a compliment?
That would be nice, too.
I expect to try.
You're the worst of that sort. You're the sort that gives that sort a bad name.
You got me beat on both accounts.
Don't fault him for having grown up on the frontier.  It was a harder time and a harder place than you know.
Our governor is a bigger fool than I thought.
Thomas is dead but you've done nothing for which you should be ashamed.
I said, I'm not my sister.
First Virginia Regulars under Colonel Hamilton.
Let us.  Unless you object, I would like to deem this meeting a formal negotiation and, as such, there are certain customary practices. Perhaps I could explain them to you...
I will do so as soon as possible.
Prisoner exchange.
Sir.
Yes, sir.
Probably.
Thank you.  How's the spotted one's milk?
The British army is barricaded in Boston.  Harry Lee, is here from Virginia, recruiting for a Continental Army.
Yes, sir.
If you're here only for revenge, you're doing a disservice to him as well as yourself.
We're low on salt.  I should go to Pembroke and get some.
What?
Granted.  Where are you going?
Is it her?  Is Anne in there?
As you did at Fort Wilderness?
I don't care.  I hate him.
I begged him to stay in the cover of the trees but he insisted the only way to break Cornwallis was muzzle- to-muzzle.  He spent too many years in the British army.
Thank you.  Maybe all of this will buy him some peace.
I'm familiar with appropriate behavior at a military parley.
That will be all, Major.  I'll wait for Lord Cornwallis.
We could go stay at Aunt Charlotte's farm.  She's to the west.
But what about Thomas?
I heard about your son.  I'm sorry.
For what?
He looks as if he's sleeping, doesn't he?
I lost another a year ago, Thomas. He was only fifteen.
No, he won't.  There are two things you need to know about Cornwallis. First, he is a very proud man, He would rather risk defeat than share a victory.  If you give him what he thinks is an out, he'll take it.
But it's already been two years and that's two more years.  The war could be over by then.
But father, they might come this way.
I'm Ellen Creed and I live at 642 Alden Lane, Dearborn, Michigan.  At least, I used to.
Ellie...Ellie...what...
Who is this Paxcow? Is he like the boogeyman?
Will you at least call and make sure daddy's okay?
Anyone who can scream that loud isn't ready for intensive care just yet-- looks like she just skinned her knee.
Yayyy!
Cause I had a bad dream about him. I dreamed he got hit by a car and you and Mr. Crandall buried him in the Pet Sematary.
I know.
That's enough, Ellen.
Well, I think Michael McDowell is so full of shit he probably squeaks when he walks, my dear.
Then you have faith in that. But we don't know it will be; after all, some crazed chair-burglar might break in while we're away and steal it, right?
Ayuh, I think 'twas. If I see Louis come home before I go to bed, I'll tell him to--
Aw, you'll be okay. Less than a mile.
Ayuh--they get older as you go toward the middle.  Pete LaVasseur's dog is buried there...  the Stoppard boys' racing pigeon that Missus Cowley's cat got...and I think that's the cat himself right there, although it's been so many years I can't tell for sure.  Missy Ellen! Come over here just a minute!
Me neither. But I believe in knowing your enemy.
Yes.
Yes.  Where are we going, Jud?
I guess so...but...
Your cairn.
Don't worry about that.
I guess it wouldn't hurt.
Wendigo?
Stanny B. did for me what I did for you last night, Louis. Only I wasn't alone when Spot came back.
What?
Well...a touch of the flu...
This babe has said enough.
Because something called a wendigo soured the ground.
Remember.
Yes--thanks. I'm Louis Creed.
Well, I've got a million questions about the area, and---
It's beautiful!
According to what Mr. Crandall says, the road's a lot more dangerous than the operation. Church will be just the same. Well--almost the same--and we won't have to worry about him getting turned into catburgers by one of those damn Orinco trucks.
Oh, you're welcome. Only if some- thing should go wrong while he's under the gas--it's a one-in-a-thousand shot, but it happens--you explain to her.
Elizabeth goes free!
He didn't waste it.
Say the name, or I slit your throat.
Now, Jack.  That reef is less than a league distant.  It's a square deal all around, and you can't hope for better.
All right then.
I can't help wondering, Jack, why you're being so helpful and all? Last time you did that, it didn't end well for you.
And he's got Old Bill's courage. A curse on him, and you!
By the powers, you're right!  Where's Jack's pistol?  Who's got it?  Bring it forward!
Can I trust you?
Think again, Miss Swann. Vile and dissolute creatures, the lot of them. I intend to see to it that any man who sails under a pirate flag, or wears a pirate brand, gets what he deserves: a short drop and a sudden stop.
And that's what concerns me. Elizabeth, we will be landing in Port Royal soon, and beginning our new lives. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we comport ourselves as befits our class and station?
Yes -- yes.
Is an occasion necessary for a father to dote upon his daughter with gifts?
Ceremony?
Miss Swann, if you'll be so kind?
I saved your life; now you've saved mine.  We're square.
The trees are taller.
Don't be thinking I'm not already working on it.
Nor did you, I noticed.
I know.  That was for the smell.
We're not going to just surrender!
Better to see it at the bottom of the sea than in the hands of a pirate.
Wait for my order -- what the blazes is that?
As likely as not.  Will, short up the anchor, we've got ourselves a ship!
We are bound for Port Royal, not Isla de Muerta.
I'll be at the wheel myself.
I've made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates.
I do.  And I practice with them. At least three hours a day.
Pirate.
Surely you've heard the stories? The Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla de Mureta ... an island that cannot be found -- except by those who already know where it is.
So it is that you found a girl. Well, if you're intending to brave all and hasten to her rescue and so win fair lady's heart, you'll have to do it alone.  I see no profit in it for me.
'Bootstrap?'
That's not true.
You didn't beat me.  You ignored the rule of engagement.  In a fair fight, I'd kill you.
These are the only ones worth having.  And we're going to need them --
Barbossa.
My name is Will Turner, the son of Bootstrap Bill Turner.  His blood runs in my veins.  You need my blood.  And on my word I will pull this trigger, and sink all the way down to Davy Jones' Locker!
... no.
He's not telling the truth.
Mentioned it, is more what he did.
Where did he come from?
Bleak.  Very bleak.
Until he's done.
Come with me, Susan.  I want to show you something.
A light mixture of oxygen, dioxide, and sodium pentothal.  He'll sleep, that's all.
In the meantime, we're going to need someone to deal with that mess in the lab.  I don't think we should call Dr. Bright.
Why are there two ottomans?
I promise, my dear, I will give the matter some consideration.
Considering what?
Dr. Nebbleman, take care of them.
The trunk.
You don't want this.
You have no idea what this is doing to your body.
Why don't you just put this in your pocket so when you see a garbage can you can put it where it belongs.
Aaabout...?
Dr. Argon would say we are all prisoners.
So, I guess it worked.
It already is.
And for cleaning up oil spills.
Well, it was good to see you, Daniel, but I have to be going.
Yeah, we'll see.
Sorry, Daniel, I'm a physicist, not a psychiatrist.
We don't?
Mostly caffeine diuretics.  Help you go to the bathroom.
If you don't want to do it this way, I can remove it surgically.
What happens?
You're the doctor.
I'm sorry, Daniel, but you have to admit it's pretty ironic that you of all people would be the first man ever polymerized.  It's got to mean something.
Blame the victim.
This is what I deserve for trying to protect the world from a madman and his mercenary physicists?
I don't consider uncontrollable toxic waste progress!
I'm glad you came to me for help.
Getting used to it.
On the counter.
I'm not leaving without you, Susan!
Oh shit, the meltdown.  It's spread to the tower.
Oh yeah?
It's a miracle.
Can I help you, Mrs. Argon?
Is that a threat, Dr. Bright?
Oh, thank you, I knew you'd understand.
Well, I tell you, yesterday when I was here, I had one of your books in my hand, and when I got outside, I realized I still had your book in my hand. So as long as I had your book in my hand, I thought I might as well take it home and read it. This morning, I got up and put your book in my hand, and here's your book in your hand.
Yeah, that was considerate of me. I recommend you read it.
Sure, I'll take a chance.
For what?
I know but that was news. This is blackmail and I don't like blackmail.
Me? No - most ordinary guy in the world, me. Only one thing wrong with me
Say, you could do anything with me you wanted to. Putty - just putty, that's me.  Now getting back to those eyes of yours - would you mind if I kind of got closer so I could see them?
When 'we' . . .?  You mean, you'd like to have me live here in your house?
Oh darling, of course it would. If it isn't - there are six rooms and two baths - but if that isn't enough, Mother will give us the blue room too, I think.
It isn't cheap. It's nice.
Gallagher!
Gallagher?
Didn't I? That's funny. Isn't it funny?
You're acting like a child.
Mother, I promise you that he won't be a reporter much longer. Once I get him away from that atmosphere and get him away from a man named Gallagher
I was so worried for fear he'd knock over a vase or something. I must have acted like an idiot.  What does it say about the reception last night?
It was a miracle. The man was ill or something.
I'll tell Mr. Smith at once, sir. Have a seat.
Oh, man!
Is that so?
But right now I'm acting in the capacity of Mrs. Schuyler's attorney.
Hey, make up your mind, will you?
Excuse me, Gallagher. I wouldn't miss this one for the world.
Sure, sure. That's all right. That was a great story, Bingy. A great story - wish I'd printed it.
With me you can always do business.
The human cash register. Got her hooks into the Schuyler kid, eh?
Get going where? I can write that yarn without stepping out of the office.
Do you call yourself a reporter?
Baloney!  Joe! Bring me a special!
My play.
I'm not quitting!
I beg your pardon, sir?
I'm Miss Wilson - Mrs. Schuyler's social secretary.
I hope not . . . I've got to call on her this morning!
Sure, the story is cold, but I'm not. I'm sizzling - look! Psst!
On now, Stew, don't be too hard on her. I wouldn't call her a brewery horse.
Well!
I didn't run away.
Sure. I wish you all the luck in the world, pal.
I hope you'll be very happy.
Say, what kind of a pal are you? You're not going to leave me flat?
Cut that out. Just because I'm married - there's no reason for that.
Pay attention? I'm not paying any attention to him. You think that guy could get me upset? Hah! Not that mug. He's a tough mug - hard, cynical. He doesn't know the fine things in life - that guy.  A bird in a gilded cage, huh? It's getting so a guy can't step out without being called a magnolia. Stew Smith, a magnolia! Not me. Say, I'm not going to hang around and be a speakeasy rat all my life! I'll tell you that. Not me, not me. I'm going to step out and mean something in this world. You watch me.  Say, am I a lucky guy to be near Anne Schuyler?  I've been hit with a carload of horseshoes, and believe me I know it. Lucky, I'll say I'm lucky!  Don't you think I'm lucky, Gallagher?
Nothing.
Hello, Stew.
Well, I've just been able to get off that Norway coast - so far.
Conrad.
Right.
Huh?  Oh, I'm not worrying about her - I'm worrying about that second act curtain, that's all.
Sorry, boss
Gallagher, that guy just dropped by to give us a great opening for the third act.
Just a habit. Mr. Schuyler is a bit put out by all the rumors going around.
No breach-of-promise case has been filed. The matter has been settled out of court.
Are the cars ready?
Why
Have you seen this?
Yes, I'm sorry, I struck him right here in your house. And I'll strike anybody in anybody's house that calls me a Cinderella Man.
Sure I'm insane, but I've got some good news for you.  This magnolia is leaving your sweet smelling vanilla joint. This bird in a cage is gonna button his own pants from now on. And that is what is known as telling the mother- in-law.
I understand, sir.
Smythe, come here. I want to talk to you.  Come on, Smythe, talk to me. Smythe, I'm going nuts. I'm going nuts in this house! This big . . . come on, I'm not going to hurt you. Come on, what's the matter with you?
No, sir!
Well sir, I'll show you.
Well, Gallagher, you certainly took no chances, did you?
What do you mean?
What?
No, I ... I was just ... worried about her.
Looks just like it did.
No ... They won't be able to tell.
What?
Thanks ... I love you.
I think it looks nice.
She's crying.
She's crying.
I was in a bowling-alley.
It's fine. You'll put on some make up and ...
No I'm not sweetie.
Um ... It's ...
Oh, gosh no.
I think ... I might be ill ...
It is?
Yeah ... How'd you know?
Gee whizz, Bud. Guess I'll just have the usual. Cheeseburger and a cherry coke.
Oh, no thanks ...
I'm fine--but thank you.
Yes I do.
Still doesn't make it right.
Um ... Yes I do. Where's our lawyer?
The basketball team?
Why am I out of order?
Well, I never had to do it before.
Um ... Outside of Pleasantville.
David, stop stressing, you can like-- turn it on normally ...
No way.
Neither do I.
As a matter of fact he does.
Just watch. You know why those guys just get cats out of trees? 'Cause nothing burns around here, that's why! They don't need any firemen ...
Well if I don't who will?
It's okay.
Remember when you told me that Lisa Rosenberg liked me?
You weren't playing a joke? She woulda gone out with me?
Yes.
I've done the slut thing, David. It's really kinda old.
Oh. Thanks, Margaret.
Oh ... Hi.
Hunh?
Scout?
Of course it is Howard. That's why they call it a Marathon.
You know, we didn't call any TV repair.
McGinty's.
Ooomph?
I can't.
Talk about it. Right now, I mean. I got to ... um ...
Re-runs?
Well they're not just cookies. I mean, they're great cookies ... Look, I'd love to get into this whole thing but I'm really running late. Why don't we hook up tomorrow?
Terrific. I'll talk to you then.
I didn't do anything wrong.
Just gimme the damn remote!
Well--I always wipe down the counter and then you set out the napkins and glasses and then I make the french fries ...
I'm so glad you're here.
Listen to me!
Hi there. You took off so quick. I wasn't sure if you were okay.
Yeah ...
There aren't any cheeseburgers.
Oh--what's the point, Bud?
... What's that?
I brought you something ... From the library.
I'll never be able to do that.
You're gonna keep painting aren't you?
That's not the reason. I've got a date at six thirty.
You know--this is a pretty strange way of showing your appreciation.
Yeah ... Saw you too.
Yeah.
No, no, no.
And what was this?
Ok. Thank you.
I'm just stopping by to say hello.
So it's ok if I bring her.
I'm trying to be your friend.
I don't know.
I have work, I can't leave.
I'm gonna call you back.
What?
I have no idea.
Nothing. I'm just at work and I'm wondering, you know your friend Lena?
....she didn't, I didn't ask her out?
I....please don't do this.
I just want to know where she's staying.
-- all I want is the number of where she's staying and that should be god damn good enough, now stop treating me this way, please -- Just Give Me The Number Elizabeth Please Now I think I will kill you if you don't.
This is Georgia.
Yeah....? So...Jack...are you stroking that big fat fucking cock of yours?
Yeah. And looking at myself in the mirror. Do you wanna know what I look like?
You have a girlfriend?
Sometimes when I'm lonely.
You sound very cute, very nice.
It's ok that I'm calling, right, I mean? It's ok.
Like seven-fifty. Seven hundred fifty?
....what....?
We got disconnected before....
I don't have a girlfriend --
I didn't lie.
No I'm sorry, now I have to get off the phone....
You think it's ok where I left it, right there?
Yeah.
Yeah, not really.
No. I'm the exact opposite --
Really?
Ok.
About six months.
Yeah?
Yeah, no, I see --
I'm sorry. I thought you said --
I thought you said you bought all that pudding --
Well, it's fine. Thank you.
Yeah.
Ok.
Lena?
When was the last time you had a girlfriend?
Yeah......yeah.....
I know what you mean, I know what you mean, I get this feeling --
Can I come home with you when we get there?
What is this?
You left me at the hospital.
That's fine.
What's that for?
337.....I'm sorry....
No I just....I don't want to, I just want to be connected to talk to a girl.
I thought I was just gonna be connected to talk to a girl - that's fine, ok, I'm sorry, it's, um.....818....
CALM DOWN SHUT THE FUCK UP AND CALM DOWN SHUT SHUT SHUT UP SHUT UP --
We back our plungers 100% and we do ask for a 30 to 60 day display on the floor.....
....I have seven.
That was weird. I meant good.
Fine, thank you.
Hi, Lance.
You're goin' on a trip?
You should go on a trip.
I'll tell you...the guy...with...just talk to me later about it, ok?
I think I got in trouble. A little bit of trouble....
Yeah.
How much money do you have in your pockets?
You have another house somewhere or something?
Are you serious with this?
What are you doing?
Are you going to the party tonight?
Right now, you're doing nothing?
You can't just not show up like you do, you have to go.
Seriously.
When can you leave?
Hey, it's me. This guy from L.A., Barry Egan is calling on the other line and saying all this stuff, he wants to talk to a supervisor or whatever --
It's fine.
Sorry.
No.
Should I call you later?
My years tending the lepers at St. Emilion steeled me for life's grisliest offerings, Doctor.
I think she's sweet on him, that's what I think.
"...a poker... he took a poker from the fire..."
Yes, Abbe?
His stinking breath caused my eyes to run, that's all.
By whom? The Marquis?
I don't take my orders from you; not anymore.
We treat you well enough here, don't we Marquis? Your very own featherbed, in lieu of a straw mat. Your antique writing desk, all the way from LaCoste. Enough quills to feather an ostrich --
I'm not a beautiful young prospect, ripe for corruption.
But we also fall in love; we build cities, we compose symphonies, and we endure. Why not put that in your books as well?
One more trick like this, and I'll be forced to revoke all your liberties!
More than your writing's at stake. The Ministry has threatened us with closure.
Our future lies in the stroke of your pen.
Don't be absurd; it's only a play.
How can one man possibly be so selfish?
You can't --! You mustn't --! I've all the demons of hell in my head; my only salvation is to vent them on paper --
Whores and pederasts? You're better off without them.
His rug.
Valcour. His chair.
A night spent with the partner of my choice.
Coulmier, you animal!
Your words drove Bouchon to --
Oh, that's rich -- coming from her lapdog --
You're no stranger to rape, Marquis; and yet with her, you cooed. You courted. You begged.
Was it impotence?
Then it must've been love --
Of course.
It's a formality; truly.
It seems a particular patient of yours has captured his fancy.
A few indiscretions in his youth.
And his writing?
Well...?
Abbe, I admire you; I do. You've a conviction... an idealism... peculiar to the very young. And so I'll be candid. The Ministry has sent me here with the most explicit... the most severe instructions.
But he's one among some two hundred wards --
And place my reputation at stake?
You keep strange company, Abbe. But if you truly have matters in hand here --
-- then I've friends of my own to visit.
That's not our intent --
Madeleine's not wicked. It's the Marquis who's corrupted her. That's not her fault; it's mine.
I'm not the first man God has asked to shed blood in His name. I will not be the last.
No one can fault Napoleon for merely bringing a man to his senses.
I'm afraid so; he's an idealist. You'll have to be politic.
I don't shed tears over the past, Monsieur Delbenè; I look to the future.
Stop, I beg you! Have pity, I say! You're not my lover; you're a monstrous rouè!
Was ever a man more risquè? He wants to take me every way!
I tremble with fear! You're bound to pound the quivering lips of my Venus mound!
You? Frighten me? That's a good one! I'm twice as fast as you are. Who'd have thought such a spent body can still boast such a fertile mind?
I suppose you want to know about that silly book of yours.
Your publisher says I'm not to leave without a new manuscript.
It's only been described to me. In your books.
Go on, child.
-- who'll whisper it to Bouchon --
Tell him I'm no fool. A prison's still a prison, even with Chinese silk and chandeliers.
Tell him -- if he uncovers our whereabouts -- you'll slit your wrists with a razor, and I'll plunge a hat- pin through my heart.
I am not a wealthy woman.
Now is the time to secure your epitaph. The benevolent Marquise, Charenton's most revered philanthropist... or Satan's Bride.
How was I to tell you? By writing a letter? WITH WHAT, MY ASININE BRIDE?
They've put you up to this, haven't they?
Houdini mice.
You need to get outta here, Rapunzel
And attractive in a hammy sort of way.
So I've been told.
Do you?
Elegant words, sir, when you have made your name and your fortune on slander and innuendo and gossip. In your papers you taught the world how to look under every rock. I learned at the knee of the master.
Over at RKO?
Darling, I talked to Millicent.
Don't
How much?
Yes.
One . . . buys things.
Nailed us, hub? The crazy old man and his whore.
Bought and p-p-paid for. Just like one of his goddamn statues. Well at least in the movie he married her!
I am not that woman.
I wanted it
Not for me.
Yes?
Sir, I-
"You talk about the people as if you owned them. As though they belonged to you. As long as I can remember, you've talked about--"  Orson, I am so goddamn tired--
"You don't care about anything except you. You just want to persuade people that you
Huh?
Nonsense
Right-
Like a bug.
Christ, we gotta go! The old man doesn't cotton to lateness.
I'm not fucking with Hughes. That shit-kicker would kill us dead, baby. Just like Jean Harlow
Image the possibilities as this man controls the public perception of the nation through his--
Listen to you. You child! Men like him don't bother with things like legality. They don't have to. You know why, boy-o?   Power.   Power like you couldn't even begin to imagine.
We're doing Hearst.
So speaks the court jester.
Then let him. What have we got to lose, you and I?
She was . . . innocent
And when he looks up? What does he dream about?
K-A-N-E. One strong syllable. Kane I
YOU CAN'T DO THIS TOME -- THIS WAS OUR STORY, REMEMBER? -- YOU AND ME AND GODDAMN EVERYONE ELSE - - REMEMBER THAT?!
Fuck you.  You wanted me out. I'm out.
"And how is the country to feel when this industry continues to employ bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees instead of real Americans? Doesn't Hollywood know there's a Depression on? Don't real Americans deserve work?"
Jews. She's talking about Jews.
So they're Jews. . .
What?! Are they going to kill me? Is that what they're going to do?!
Aw, cheer up, George'll probably be running Fox by the morning. Let's get a drink.
Thank you-
800,000 dollars fully covers the production budget and a little more. Hell, George, you even make a profit on the deal.
And we gotta be clear here. I need the negative and every existing print.
Get out
Again.
When Hedda says "I'm coming" you mix a lot of martinis and you pray.
Then find another theater
Why don't you just have the guts to admit it
That soulless monster gets no tears from me.
No, we're jake. But listen-
Happy birthday.
I know what you want but it can't be done!
Orson -- we can't get the fucking camera any fucking lower so find another fucking shot!
For what?
I'm Ok.
How can he embarrass you?
Now the fight's off the books altogether. Meyer Lansky couldn't get a bet down on this fight. Some people are saying you're going into the tank.
Here's your steak. You can't wait for it to be done. Here.
You heard me, I said hit me.
I didn't tell them to come. Tommy Como...
No, I'm not afraid. Why? You wanna meet her?
You sure you wanna meet her? Don't make me go over there, you change your mind and you make me look bad, cause she's really a knockout. She's 15, this kid -- a great piece of ass.
Give me a chance. Let me look.
Whadda I gotta do, Joey? I knocked him down. What did I do wrong? I don't understand.
You want the title shot or not?
I remember the first time I met Vickie... I know there's somethin' up. I know she's doin' somethin', but I can't catch her...
I want you to keep an eye on her when I'm not here. Understand?
Yeah, except fall down. That's right.
No, I just told you what happened.
So, go ahead. Kill everybody. Kill Salvy, kill Vickie, kill Tommy Como, kill me while you're at it. What do I care? You're killing yourself the way you're eating, the way you worry about things you don't have to worry about.
What?
How many pounds I gotta lose?
Come over here.
Jake...
I'm not interested in him.
Nobody. I love you, remember?
Tryin' to get this fuckin' TV to work. Paid all this money for it and still can't get a station a mile away. And Mr. Wizard here ain't no help.
I don't know what it is. I dunno, it's the kind of thing that -- the words won't come out.
No. This time it's true. I didn't bother to tell you until I had everything worked out.
I need ten thousand dollars. My lawyer says if we can spread ten thousand bucks around, we can get the case dropped.
Don't make no difference no more.
Jake, sit down for a minute.
C'mon, Tommy --
I'll suck your eyes out! I'll fuckin' take the two of you.
That's right, take his part. You're his brother. He's never gonna be champ. Too many people are against him.
This is L. B. Jefferies, a friend of Tom's. Who am I talking with?
Well, if he calls in, tell him to get in touch with L. B. Jefferies right away. I might have quite a surprise for him.
From the looks of Davidson's cable, it might even go higher than that. And we haven't even got a camera over there.
Get that idea out of your mind. It will only lead you in the wrong direction.
Didn't you take it to the crime lab?
Go ahead, Doyle -- tell me he's an unemployed magician -- amusing the neighborhood with sleight-of-hand.
Well, officer -- do your duty.
For instance?
Who left -- where?
Give him evidence.
By morning there might not be anything left to find in his apartment.
Well, in the garage, back home, we --
A possibility.
Like an old hambone?
For getting rid of that cast.
I didn't ask you to stand in the middle of that automobile race track.
I've been taking pictures so long I don't know how to read anymore.
Can you see me -- rushing home to a hot apartment every night to listen to the automatic laundry, the electric dishwasher, the garbage disposal and a nagging wife.
Well -- you know best. Call you later, Jeff.
It's me.
Who are you?
Those sultry sun-worshipers you watch haven't raised your temperature one degree in four weeks.
Lisa Fremont.
No.
Too perfect. Too beautiful, too talented, too sophisticated, too everything -- but what I want.
How did you know!
I was.
She's real eat, drink and be merry girl.
Well, the salesman could be available soon.
It's hard to figure. He went out several time last night, in the rain carrying his sample case.
Uh-uh. The dog. I think I know now why Thorwald killed it.
Got a shovel?
That'll get her out of there, won't it?
I'm afraid it is, Tess.
Tell him not to waste time calling. To get over here soon as he can. I think Thorwald's pulling out tonight.
Empty as a football.
Not too active.
We sell a dozen a day in this price range.
Tired?
You mean leave the magazine?
That's what I'm afraid of.  Could you see me -- driving down to the fashion salon in a jeep -- wearing combat boots and a three day beard?
You can't fit in here -- I can't fit in there. According to you, people should be born, live an die on the same --
Ever get shot at, run over, sandbagged at night because people got unfavorable publicity from your camera?
You mean "goodnight."
Your mind is. And when I want a man, I want all of him.
Tell me about it.
Something too frightful to utter.
Do you think I consider this recreation?
Where's the doctor -- the undertakers?
There's nothing to see.
Someone not his wife?
Well that's fine, but I only have one bed, and --
I do?
Who was the trunk addressed to?
Jeff -- if anybody walked in here, I don't think they'd believe what they see.
I think I'll start reviving it tomorrow, with say -- Miss Torso for a start?
Thank you.
Well, -- if there was one less thread this way --  -- and two less that way --  -- I might give up bachelorhood.
It could be -- the knife, and the saw.
Too close.
Maybe I can get Thorwald out of the apartment.
How?
I heard about it.  You're lucky he lived.
I'm cute, too.
What?
Somebody find him a knife.
How 'bout you?  Say the word and you're cold, Jack--you're dead.
Know the Millertown bluff?
Hi.
We got a cookaboo inside.  He wounded some kid earlier.
Crunch--my father's--You going to kill him?
You mind if I try?  You have to slam the door in my face?  I try to get to him--what happens?  Don't I give you everything you want?  A bicycle--you get a bicycle. A car--
Not just buy!  You hear all this talk about not lovely your kids enough.  We give you love and affection, don't we?
You make any sandwiches?
Yeah!
Yes.
How'd that happen!  What kind of trouble you in?
I'm in terrible trouble.--You know that big high bluff near Miller- town Junction?
That's not what I mean.  I've never done anything right.  I've been going around with my head in a sling for years...I don't want to drag you into this but I can't help it.  I don't think I can prove anything by going around pretending I'm tough any more, so maybe you look like one thing but you still feel like another.
Will you wait a minute?
Sure.  Sure.
That's right!
What's that pounding?
Do you hear from him, son?
My parents know I'm out.  They know I'm here.
I'll wait for him.
Hi there.
Jim.  What's yours?
I know.  That's why I came back.
I just don't want trouble.
I saw it.  Gee, look at that thing swing, will you?  Do you think it never stops?
No.  In the morning.
Wow!  Well now-there-then!
I had to go to a head-shrinker.  I only went twice though.  My mother said it cost too much, so she went to Hawaii instead.
When was that?
Your father!
I've got a gun.
We didn't run out.  We were coming right back.
I need it.
They like you.  Okay?
But you didn't hurt anybody.
I have to talk to someone, Mom.  I have to talk to you both.  And Dad this time you got to give me an answer.
Grandma?
Pretty mixed up?
"If he could" what?  You mean your father?
Chicken?
Where what was.
Won't mother be proud.
Oh.
I'm numb.
I'm never going back.
There's just one thing.  What about--
See, we're very modern.
Not exactly.  It's certainly huge.
Hi.
You disappointed?
So do you.
Oh, I don't know.  You have to get to know him.  He doesn't say much but when he does you know he means it.  He's sincere.
Oh, we can manage that!  I'll scrimp and save and work my fingers to the bone...
I was just talking a walk.  I tried to call the kids but everybody was out and I couldn't find them.  I hate my life.  I just hate it.
No.
My mother?
You said you'd call my father.
We were romantic then too--
I didn't want to stop.
I'd like to, that's all.  Girls your age don't do that.  You need an explanation?
Gabriel, what are you doing!
Gabriel!
Don't hurt him...
I promised that when he helped us, we'd be gone! When he helped us! Loverboy don't want to play!
One more day, baby. One more day to Christmas.
Toys for adults. Where are your toys for adults?
Yeah.
Radio said.
Ashley, no. That was me, that's what I was scared of. I mean, be serious... I ain't exactly looking like Mr. Universe here.
I'm talking about the heart, Nick. I'm not talking about the words.
What's going ON!!!
I won't let him hurt you! He just wants what you know!
No. He wants to be working for himself someday.
...Haven't had cranberry buns... in five whole years...
You're the getaway girl. The money's gonna get to you eventually. Gonna be my job to be the guy who walks outta there with it. But I can't do that without a gun. Any luck talking to him?
We need a gun, Ash. We need a gun...
Rudy. How'd you know my name?
I... you told me your name was Rudy. You told me a million times, back in the truck, telling me you weren't Nick --
You got the wrong guy! She thinks I'm Nick, I'm not!
I shared his cell!
Yes!
Yes!
She says a lot of things.
Bam Bam.
Her brother.
I don't know.
Christmas... Eve...
At least gimme video poker.
...never... tried...
Nothing... I promise-nothing...
I been driving rigs a long time, Nick. Four, five million miles of road. Worked for people who wouldn't keep me on less I was driving fifteen hours a day. Tell 'em I needed sleep, I needed rest, shit, they'll hire someone else...
You go in with five, you're either leaving an alarm free or an exit free. Someone hits an alarm, you're fucked. Someone gets to a phone, gets outside, 'cross the street, whatever, you're fucked. You need six.  Six is me.
Well. What you guys have to plan out, then... is how you're going to get to that cage and that security level before anybody realizes anything's wrong. Running in with ski masks and bullets flying ain't gonna do it.
What, we walking in there and delivering toys?
Show's over.
What... Powwow...
I don't steal any --
Where is he?! Where is he?!
I got a bacon for him and a bacon for me; there's four cheeseburgers and two roast beefs --
How do we do that?
Ain't there yet.
Yeah.
I'm just talking.
Yeah. You grow up in Detroit, you get matured real quick.
No, I think that's just oranges. She writes here she's eating oranges.
Thought you hated Sidnaw.
Pinscher told me Alamo thinks I'm the one ratted on him beating up Cree. Since I was there, I saw it, he thinks I got him sent to solitary.
Alamo...
Take it, man! You're all right! Hold it in! GUARD!
You're GONNA be there! We're getting outta here! TAKE IT!
...for Christmas...
She set them up. All of them.
How'd you know I'd do it.
Walk outta there and tell her I was you.
You gave them me.
First off, I don't have a boss. Are you clear about that?
Funny you should mention it. That's what your father and I been talkin' about.
Now ain't that a sad sight, daddy, walks into jail a white man, walks out talkin' like a nigger. It's all that black semen been shootin' up his butt. It's backed up into his brain and comes out of his mouth.
You don't hafta lift shit. You don't really work there. But as far as the records are concerned, you do. I call up Matthews, the foreman, tell him he's got a new guy. You're on the schedule. You got a timecard, it's clocked in and out for you everyday, and you get a pay check at the end of the week. And ya know dock workers don't do too bad. So you can move into a halfway decent place without Scagnetti thinkin "what the fuck." And if Scagnetti ever wants to make a surprise visit, you're gone that day. That day we sent you to Tustin. We gotta bunch of shit you needed to unload there. You're at the Taft airstrip pickin' up a bunch of shit and bringing it back. Part of your job is goin' different places - and we got places all over the place.
You ain't dying, he is.
Really? Who's your P.O.?
This isn't all that bad. We can give you a lot of legitimate jobs. Put you on the rotation at Long Beach as a dock worker.
That's okay, Eddie, I do.
Nobody did. You assholes turn the jewelry store into a wild west show, and you wonder why cops show up.
It's not the black Beverly Hills, it's the black Palos Verdes. Anyway, this chick, Elois, was a man-eater- upper. I bet every guy who's ever met her has jacked off to her at least once. You know who she looked like? Christie Love. 'Member that TV show "Get Christie Love"? She was a black female cop. She always used to say "You're under arrest, sugar."
Let me say this out loud, just to get it straight in my mind. According to you, Mr. Blonde was gonna kill you. Then when we came back, kill us, grab the diamonds, and scram. That's your story? I'm correct about that, right?
Yeah.
Did the two of you talk?
The Milwaukee Brewers?
Fuckin' A. I tell it real good, too.
Something funny that happened to you while you were doing a job.
What for?
Mr. Brown stays in the car. He's parked across the street till I give him the signal, then he pulls up in front of the store.
A guy named Scagnetti. Seymour Scagnetti.
It's the least I could do Vic. I wish I coulda done more.  Vic. Toothpick Vic. Tell me a story? What're your plans?
Well, it's kinda a strange time right now. Things are kinda -
Oh fuck, Toby's that little china girl.
Why am I Mr. Pink?
Jesus Christ, Joe. Fuckin' forget it. This is beneath me. I'm Mr. Pink, let's move on.
What do you care?
I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do with it.
He's doin' twenty years in Susanville.
Bad luck. What's the exposure like?
How many employees?
Like hell I am.
And I'm dying. They don't know that. All they know is they're not to make a move until Joe Cabot shows up. I was sent undercover to get Cabot. You heard 'em, they said he's on his way. Don't pussy out on me now, Marvin. We're just gonna sit here and bleed until Joe Cabot sticks his fuckin' head through that door.
You didn't ask.
Larry, I'm so scared, would you please hold me.
It's not good...
You could've asked the cop, if you didn't just kill him. He talked about what he was going to do when he was slicing him up.
No, I can't. You know what I heard the other day? "Heartbeat-It's Lovebeat," by little Tony DeFranco and the DeFranco Family. I haven't heard that since I was in fifth fuckin' grade.
Look, I ordered coffee. Now we've been here a long fuckin' time, and she's only filled my cup three times. When I order coffee, I want it filled six times.
You even doubt it? I don't think we got set up, I know we got set up! I mean really, seriously, where did all those cops come from, huh? One minute they're not there, the next minute they're there. I didn't hear any sirens. The alarm went off, okay. Okay, when an alarm goes off, you got an average of four minutes response time. Unless a patrol car is cruising that street, at that particular moment, you got four minutes before they can realistically respond. In one minute there were seventeen blue boys out there. All loaded for bear, all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing, and they were all just there! Remember that second wave that showed up in the cars? Those were the ones responding to the alarm. But those other motherfuckers were already there, they were waiting for us.  You haven't thought about this?
Splash some water on your face. Take a breather.
That was one of the most insane fucking things I've ever seen. Why the fuck would Joe hire somebody like that?
That's the way I look at it. A choice between doin' ten years, and takin' out some stupid motherfucker, ain't no choice at all. But I ain't no madman either. What the fuck was Joe thinkin'? You can't work with a guy like that. That motherfucker's unstable. What do you think? Do you think he panicked, or ya think he's just trigger-happy?
Two jobs back, it was a four man job, we discovered one of the team was an undercover cop.
For all I know, you're the rat.
Go down the hall, turn left, up those stairs, then turn right.
I think he's just passed out.
Well, first things first, staying here's goofy. We gotta book up.
Well that's that, then. I mean, I was worried about mug shot possibilities already. But now he knows:  what you look like,  what your first name is,  where you're from and  what your specialty is. They ain't gonna hafta show him a helluva lot of pictures for him to pick you out. That's it right, you didn't tell him anything else that could narrow down the selection?
That fuckin did it!
We don't think this place is safe.
What are you gonna do about him?
Oh that's really easy for you to say, you're Mr. White. You gotta cool-sounding name. So tell me, Mr. White, if you think "Mr. Pink" is no big deal, you wanna trade?
Nobody. The light was bad.
And one of 'em is sick.
You can stay here if you like.
Steve and me, we use a saddle for a pillow and roll up in a tarp.
In the grub box.  Toward morning the dew gets kind of heavy so maybe you better fix up a bed under the wagon. Spread some bunch grass under the tarp and the ground won't be so hard.
Would you, Mr. Phillips?
Oh, it did. It had a great deal to do with you.
So that's it --  You think I was making fun of your girl in gingham.
If you want to go on, I can make it all right.
Thanks for loading me on the stage. I know now why you did it.
I haven't got the job yet.
Then don't come sneakin' around a man's camp.
It wouldn't happen to be this...
A little hot.
The thing to do is stick to rabbits.
Yeah -- and Lednov's only lookin' for one man. Me.
How'd you happen to miss?
Good thing you didn't.
But you never can tell. Why don't you get that new rifle out of the wagon?
I'm not, but there's some of it I don't see any sense to.
That ain't why. I just figure it's about time to start runnin' my own life.
You'll get your share. Go on. I don't want you around.
All right, you didn't know.
Nobody asked you to.
All right, you didn't know.
He won't take us.  Don't you want us around?
If you're worried about Mary and me talkin' too much, don't. No matter how many questions your old man asks. We know how to keep our mouths shut.
Not if I know Mary. When she rides into Sonora, you'll be with her. And mighty glad to be there after this. I don't see how you stood it as long as you did.
Darling -- now I've got you all upset.
Plenty more.  And somewhere up there's the lode, the rock rotten with it.
What do you know about that. Did you sell your place?
Why didn't you say you wanted to get married back in Aspen. I told the man in Sonora there were four of us. If only three show up, he might call the whole deal off. We've got to stick together. Like we've always done.
Until Pa gets around to driving us to Minden.
Go ahead.  Get in training for the pioneer life. I'm finding the nearest body of water and climbing into it.
Maybe you are. I'm not.
Sounds fine. Only that isn't how it's going to be.
He can wait. Let's stay here until morning.
No. We're not stayin' --
Without someone to teach you, it's tough.
Unicorn -- a kind of animal --
Oh, I wasn't worrying.  I saw him saddling up and thought he was ready to leave.
Oh, sure.
Goodnight, Miss Wells.
Ah, they just don't know you the way I do.
Never happened!
You better be careful. I heard some girl got her ass whooped and jacket stolen earlier today.  Hey, what class do we have next?
Hello Ray.
Ray, have you been here all this time?
Oh, I'm fine... just clowning around.
He's so brave.
Thanks. I'm Cindy.
Yeah, it's great, isn't it. I think it's so cool... have a girl as a friend.
It sounds gay, but guess since you're a girl it's okay, huh?
Sure. We can practice talking.
Well, I was hoping to get my balls licked.
Can you feel that?
I know, but I've been thinking --
Look, what I'm trying to say --
Oh.
I don't care. You pick.
Thanks, I'll be fine.
It's okay.
Yeah, they're so warm and soft.
What's your location? I repeat, what's your location?
Yes, Professor Oldman's group. Forgive me. I didn't mean to frighten you.
I'm Hanson the caretaker.
Thanks. I made them by hand.
Not in a thousand years.
My child, you're alive!
Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?
Aww, you ain't that bad. You just need a little flava. First thing we gotta do is get you some new gear.
Gear. You know, clothing.
I'm going to work in Washington, Cindy.
That's where my best customers are. Marion Berry, George Bush, the Redskins. I'd like to offer you a job, Cindy. Can you type? Take dictation? Swallow balloons filled with cocaine?
Yeah, bitch, give me my apple. What's gotten into you?
Let me see the files.
I don't need your help. I'm perfectly capable.
Right. What about condoms?
It's not what is looks like. She's having a breakdown. Help me get her to her room.
Just a little experiment.
Just a little Rogaine.
Alright, go to the belt store...
Yes... Sometimes you have to give them candy.
Because she will lie?
Dog, you look hot.
Shorty, why don't you say grace?
Get out?! What does it say?
The "Citizen Kane" of gore movies.
Bye, bird-brain. See ya, Scotty.
It's the influence of all those family films.  Right, Mom?  Hey, Mom??...
You don't think...
Jeeezzz!
I DO! Mom's gone crazy!
There you go. I love Bill Cosby pictures.
Let me see!
Looks good, Mom!
But, Chip...
This is so silly.
That's right.
Doesn't threaten me, honey. I'm happy.
I can't believe I thought my own mother was a murderess!
Ooh, honey, I'm ready! Now! Now!
Amen to that.  It's been a crazy day, hasn't it?!
Sorry, ma'am.  We're investigating obscene phone calls and mail threats to a certain Mrs. Dottie Hinkle.
Let me check the zip - 212 Fuck you?
Mrs. Wilson from the telephone company. I understand you're having problems with obscene calls.
Alright, I'll try...  "Cocksucker". That's what she calls me.
GODDAMN YOU!
No, I don't.
I certainly was not!
Yes, I was.
Sorry, Mom. Thanks.  Hey, Chip, think I could get 50c for Vanilla Ice.
Don't say words unless you mean them, Misty.
If you wouldn't mind...  It was on sale.
Ewwww!  Thank you, Rosemary.
Yes... but... I didn't...
Right here!
Nice to meet you, Mr. Stubbins.  A little something I baked.
Bon Appetit!
He's a good boy.
His unhealthy obsession with sick horror films.
That's no excuse for a morbid imagination. I caught him drawing this in class last week.  Is there a problem at home?
Nice one, huh? Winter's coming.  Three dollars?... I guess that's what I marked it...
Yeah - sure.
Okay, Mr. Radeau, it's forgot.
Mr. August, I'm not at all sure -
Yes.
No.
You could go and open the door.
No.
If Jacqueline wants money she can come to me herself.
She can only use cash.
Hello, Frances.
I don't know. That's why I came to see Mrs. Redi. I'm trying to find her.
I can't understand it at all.
What does she do with herself after business hours?
No. She asked about the trademark.
Because I loved Jacqueline I thought I knew her. Today I found out such strange things frightening things. I saw a hangman's noose that she had hanging - waiting  I feel as if I'd never known her.
But you do believe me?
He was a kind little man in his way  and I made him go down that hall into the darkness. I made him do it.
But you have treated me that way.
Things changed, Mary. The reasons for finding Jacqueline changed. I want to find Jacqueline to settle things.
Good night.
I know  I shouldn't have told you
I don't think that's a good subject for jokes, Mr. Hoag.
You don't even know Jacqueline Gibson.
This is the part of New York I love. It is old. It has memories. If you listen, the houses will speak to you. Walt Whitman...Edna St. Vincent Millay... Eugene O'Neill...in their time they've all lived here.
I don't know.
We could tell him.
That you love Mary.
I'm Mimi -- I'm dying.
Yes. It's been quiet, oh ever so quiet. I hardly move, yet it keeps coming all the time -closer and closer. I rest and rest and yet I am dying.
Yes.
Yes.
Jason, I'm going back to Highcliffe. I came to say good-by.
We are happy, Mrs. Romari, because you have everything  and I am happy because I have nothing to lose.
I want to see what they read so I'll know what kind of books to give my friends as presents. There's nothing nicer for a gift than a book.
I wouldn't want to take them out. I just want to look at them.
I don't think that you would understand if I told you.
Uhhuh.
Actually I want to ask two favors of you -- one as a poet 	one as a detective.
It goes beyond that. It praises the goodness of God and the greatness of all His works.
I'd forgotten.
Perhaps
It might have.
Yes, Miss Gibson. I've come to take you to your sister.
You know where she is?
A strange collection. You're like the false god you worship... fallen angels, all of you.
I'm afraid not.
Leave me your address, and if I find anything, I'll get in touch with you.
Thank you, my dear.
She's not been here for a long time.
Oh yes, yes. One day a beautiful car comes here. This beautiful lady in furs gets out. There is a handsome man with her, and the chauffeur  The lady rents one of our upstairs rooms. The chauffeur changes the lock on the door. Then the lady never comes back --not to live, anyhow. She came back three, four times, but always alone and just to eat.
Sometimes she can be quite careless. Why don't you try Mrs. Redi?
I doubt if you'll get anything out of that woman. But if  you'd like to try, I'll advance you the money to make the trip to New York. Of course, my dear, if you don't find your sister, you can always come back here.
I can quote that too; "Those who shall go out into the market place and let their tongues speak of us, and give knowledge of our being and our deeds, whom-so-ever doeth this shall die."
Yes, Jacqueline. You were always talking suicide - - of ending your life when you wanted to.
Oh, no problem. It can wait.
I used to take great pleasure in that, being purposefully different, rubbing people's noses in it. Didn't you do that when you were younger?
Did you know that if you shut someone up in a room, and the only clock he has reference to runs two hours slow for every twenty-four, that his body will eventually adjust to that schedule? Simply because the mind honestly perceives that twenty-six hours are twenty-four, the body follows. And then there are sections of time. Your life can be broken down into the sections of time that formed your personality . For instance, when I was twelve, I had an eleven minute conversation with my father that to this day defines our relationship. Now, I'm not saying that everything happened in that specific section of time, but the events of my childhood involving my father led up to, and then were crystallized in, that eleven minutes.
Nine years.
I knew him very well. We were extremely close until I dropped out.
Oh, lots of reasons, most of them boring. But, up until I dropped out, John and I were... very much alike.
I would imagine that we are, now. I think I'm ready to use the bathroom, finally.
Thank you.
What's the first?
How do you mean?
Not usually. I mean, honestly, I haven't known many guys that could think straight with an erection, so I feel I'm way ahead of the game as far as being clear-headed goes.
They are looking at you. Ann, you are truly breathtaking. I don't know if you understand how your appearance can affect people. Men want to possess you, women wish they looked like you. And those that don't or can't resent you. And the fact that you're a nice person just makes it worse.
You're in therapy?
I believe in it for some people. I mean, for me it was silly, I was confused going in. So I just formed my own personal theory that you should never take advice from someone of the opposite sex that doesn't know you intimately.
You had sex with you therapist?
Ann. Hello.
Not much to see, I'm afraid. I'm sort of cultivating a minimalist vibe.
What kind of personal project?
Who's Donna?
All of these are interviews?
Why not?
Like what they've done, what they do, what they don't do, what they want to do but are afraid to ask for, what they won't do even if asked. Anything I can think of.
I know.
I know.
She said it on her tape.
Ann, when would I have told you? We were not speaking, if you recall.
What do you have to do to get ready?
Then do it.
Why?
I fantasized about you.
No.
So you have had sex.
What was the problem?
How come?
I'm not planning on it.
Possibly.
As I said, I haven't decided what to do, exactly. Perhaps I won't do anything.
I don't care.
That's interesting, because I didn't leave a message.
Are you having an affair?
My sister, for one. Is that who it is?
Always the lawyer.
You've made your point.
I don't, either. I mean, Cynthia, of all people. She's so...
Quitting your therapy won't feed the children of Ethiopia.
I drove around. Then I went to talk with Graham.
Yes.
Not very often.
You bitch. I knew it.
Yeah, I know.
I take it you've never masturbated?
The friend of John's that was staying at your house.
Is he still at your house?
I've been thinking about it for awhile, and then I was talking to somebody who kind of put things in perspective for me.
Why?
Well, he doesn't strike me as the kind of person that would go in for that sort of thing, anyway.
He's not getting a phone, he doesn't like talking on the phone.
Let me talk to him first.
What do you mean he doesn't want me to come over? Did you tell him about me?
Why not?
Then what's the story, what's this "strange" bullshit all of a sudden? Is he drowning puppies, or what?
Well, what, then?
What kinds of questions?
Did he ask you to take your clothes off?
But why did you want to?
You don't know that for sure.
You touched him?
You are in trouble.
You know what I mean, you don't even know him!
It looks like a tablecloth.
Thirty-two dollars.
Did you take your clothes off?
I'm Ann Millaney's sister.
She must have been in a good mood when she said that. She usually calls me loud.
Nope.
I think you're right. So come on, I came all the way over here to find out what got Ann so spooked, tell me what happened.
What do you get?
I just want to ask you questions.
That depends on you. One woman only used three minutes. Another filled up three two hour tapes.
Whichever you prefer.
I can't talk you into it?
I only get one today? Gee, how exciting.
Why?
I did.
Could be risky.
Cynthia. John. Meet me at my house in exactly one hour.
Oh.  Well, when, then?
Well, you know him, he's a friend of yours, do you think he can be trusted?
I like the way he dresses.
You told Ann about this?
I just... Ann is very...
You realize you have no recourse legally? This stuff could show up anywhere.
By definition you're lying to Ann, too.
Look, are we going to do it or not?
Maybe I don't want to leave. Maybe I want to talk.
No.  You said three-fifty?
How about for five hundred?
What do you think the Greeks would make of that outfit you're wearing?
What do you mean?
You're hesitating. I think that means you have.
Yes?
Yeah.
All right, jesus.
Was he nice to you?
Sure.
I knew the man, Emil Hobbes, a doctor and a professor at university. I saw the girl around the building but I didn't know her. She never came to the clinic.
How did he sound this time? Was he nervous? Depressed?
Far as I know, yeah, that was her.
Yeah, that's Dr. St. Luc. He's the head of our little medical clinic here.
I think I... I think I killed him. I stabbed him with something and he fell.
What do you want to call me at the office for?
Nick, you're so strange...
Please pardon me. I am Niccolo Spergazzi. I am a resident here. I don't know... we were walking in the hallway and... Cabiria... my wife... she was attacked by this thing... here, on her arm.
Just breathe normally.
Didn't she ever have these lumps looked at by a doctor?
Was this girl from Starliner Towers?
Gonna cut me open?
OK. I'll think about it.
That you, Rog?
Huh?
I dunno. Try tranquilizers. Once you can get at them, there's a lotta stuff you can use. I'll bring a bagful. It's just the standard tropical kit. But the trick is to get at them.
NIGHT NIGHT
As Janet's parents this should be really easy.  Your last clue... Mental Instability.  You have thirty seconds.
I got it!  I got it!!!
I'm Janet Majors and this is my husband Brad.
I've caught it once or twice.
LITTLE BLACK DRESS
Everyone loves the girl next door, particularly Farley.
They probably meant Irving and wanted you to swing.
Dentonvale has been sold.
Farley is already a TV winner as we shall see.  Dentonvile will run forever now that his interest has embraced mental hygiene.
Show yourself.  The real you. The secret you.
Delighted, Betty -- That is if you don't mind being seen with an older man.
Not at all.  You have your life.  And I have mine.
I'M LOOKING FOR TRADE
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE FASHION
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR MOVEMENT
He was adopted you know.
Let's just say that I'm putting sanity back on the national menu.
Oh.  Mom.  It's Brad.
Thank God he was born an orphan. It would have killed his parents.
I'm sorry, Officer.
YOUNG BLOOD
Good!  Well there's still hope. Lots of hope.
Of course.  He was in great danger of harming himself.
I'm sick of hearing about that lame dog.  I've got a lot going for me.  I'm going places.  I'm going to be someone.  I'm gonna win my way into the lives and hearts of people even if I have to kill to do it.  I'll make the pathetic little crumbs love me. I don't even know why I'm wasting my time here with you.  I should be with my people...
YOU'RE NO GOOD
...and an attractive financial prospect for Denton.
It's all in the wrist.  You know, you look really familiar. You from around here? Where'd you go to high school?
Well, then put him at the singles table.
Then put him with the Feldmans. Whatever you and your Mom decide is fine with me.
I don't know, Christine. Perhaps it's because I feel attacked.
Hey, Evelyn, it's your favorite client.
So I guess that's it.
Soon, soon. Say, this is my buddy Jack. He's getting married next week.
Say, is Maya working?
Oh, stop it. Make yourselves comfortable.  You boys hungry?
Oh, that was for, uh, wait... That was for Spray and Wash.
Excellent. My friend and I are up here doing the wine tour, and he tells me that you folks make one hell of a Syrah.
In Santa Ynez.  And I agree with you about Cab Franc.
Me too.
Couple of wrong turns.  Thanks to Magellan, here.
No, I'm an actor.
Well, in that case...
You said you had it all lined up.
I don't know. Senior editor? Sounds like you're in to me.
Color in the red wines comes from the skins. This juice is free run, so there's no skin contact in the fermentation, ergo no color.
I liked it a lot. A lot of improvements. It just seemed overall, I don't know, tighter, more... congealed or something.
Oh yeah. Much better.
She's a kid, Jack. I don't even look at that stuff anymore.
As if she'd even be attracted to guys like us in the first place.
I'd rather have a knife.
Jack. This week is not about me. It's about you. I'm going to show you a good time. We're going to drink a lot of good wine, play some golf, eat some great food, enjoy the scenery and send you off in style.
I owe her a call anyway.
Just a minute!
So you're going to stop acting?
Then it's a good thing.
Pour us a couple.
You know her?
This gal's married to I think a Philosophy professor at UC Santa Barbara.
Well, she does know a lot about wine.
And she likes Pinot.
How do you know?
So what's the plan today?
Beautiful.
About a month ago. Six weeks.
You have the keys.
With Maya?
Well, she is cute.
Okay! Fuck!
Okay! Jesus!
Upstairs. Getting cleaned up.
What?
Well... I don't know, just... the wedding.
Yes I have, and do I look like a happy man? Was all that drama with Brenda a happy thing for me to do? Huh? Was it? Is she a part of my life now?
You're crazy. You've gone crazy.
You're an asshole.
Slaughterhouse.
He wrote a great one on Burgundy, and I used to get his newsletter, but then there were doubts about whether he does all his own tasting. Plus a couple of times he declared certain years vintages of the century, and they turned out to be turkeys. Fucker never retracted.
No.
Shut up! Shut up, Jack!
You told him. I'm fucking hurting here.
Sure I'm sure. And just what are you implying? I'm really pissed off at you about all this, if you want to know the truth. What's Maya going to think of me now just for associating with you? You're the one who's sabotaging me, not the other way around, pal. Not by a longshot.
That's five clicks, Jackson.
No way. No way.
Horny as shit. Flopping around like a landed trout.
I'm fine. You rest.
You said it looked like a car accident.
Maya, how are you?
Oh, no, actually. Busy night.
A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc.
I know the winemaker. She comes in the restaurant all the time.
Hey.
How long have you been into wine?
I think they overdid it a bit. Too much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.
Who me? Nah, I'd just fuck them up. That was the one unpolluted part of my divorce -- no kids.
So... you want to work for a winery or something someday?
My palate's kind of shot, but from what I can tell, I'd dub it pretty damn good.
Great. What's the latest we can get there?
It's Miles. Listen, I don't know if you even care, but I had to call and tell you again how much I enjoyed our time together and how sorry I am things turned out the way they did. I think you're great, Maya -- always have. From the first time you waited on me.  And while I'm at it, I guess you should know that my book is not getting published. I thought this one had a chance, but I was wrong. Again. Don't bother reading it -- you've got better things to do. So you see I'm not much of a writer. I'm not anything really. The only real talent I seem to have is for disappointing people and now you know that firsthand. We're leaving in the morning, and I want you to know that I take with me wonderful memories of you. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
Yeah, he's good that way. Very considerate.
So what's happening with your book?
I'm pregnant.
Both.
I told you I need a drink.
Yeah. Good food. You've got quite a wine collection. Very impressive.
Well, you boys do what you want. I just think it would be nice for us to be together as a family on my birthday.
This one?
Don't touch him.
Who said I was going to die?
Me too.
I don't feel much.
Boy, why aren't you in the pros making stacks of cash and getting handfuls of T and A?
Good choice... I'm going to have a cheeseburger with bacon.  Extra bacon.
They already know we're here.
What are you doing?
They think over a hundred thousand. They're just estimates.  But we held strong.
Oh.
Bimboo?
You're scaring your sister.
Don't call me Father. It's just Graham now.
What kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn over without cracking it?
What was the first thing?
I would say so.
Do you owe anybody money? You can tell me off the record if you need too.
Six months.
Posse? What the hell you talking about?
No money, eh?
What do you mean, the horses?
That's why they got you in jail?
...And you had to kill him?
Your next water ain't for three days.
Someplace safe. How you feeling?
Where's Jake?
Have you thought at all about your plans?
They've been kind to me.
I guess I put a good scare into him.
I just came out to say goodbye.
It's one thing to know it...
Ten A.M.
I had to get up anyway.
Maybe I'll go along as far as Chimayo. Get me some clothes. Maybe a bath.
Which way do you mean?
I understand.
You haven't got any money.
I paid the government for it, all right. That don't mean much out here.  Malachi, I'm living like a wildcat in a cave in those hills. Hiding out, afraid to walk my own land.
We got married just before this trip, so we could come out here and try the land. It's hard to find a man willing to take on a life like that.
Believe it.
What's that?
His son is worse than he was. He's smoother, so you don't always hear him coming, but he'll do anything to keep his range free.
He'll be here.
He is now.
Oh, a guy who got run out of town...
All I did was kiss the girl.
We're going to make some adjustments. I wanted you to be here when I offered Paden your job. I think he could do it without getting greedy. Stella and I are tired of you skimming our profits.
Is there a place in town that takes... my kind?
So this is the guy you're going to hang?
Oh that's just fine. Where were you when Ma and Daddy needed you? It's too late, Mal. Now you finally show up and all you can think of is to get yourself killed.
We'll handle that. He's careless.
I heard that too.
Well I'm real happy for you, Cobb. But I think I'll keep looking for mine.
I just got to town.
Maybe we ought to ask Stella.
Yeah, maybe I will too.
Cobb, you've got nothing I need.
The world is what you make of it, friend. If it doesn't fit, you make alterations.
What do you mean?
I wouldn't worry about that.
That's right.  You understand perfectly.  I will confess to fraud, not murder.
Who?
Okay -- for you.
I'm glad we talked.
Difficult.  I'm difficult.
Well, I do remember why I started out in this business -- you seem to have forgotten -- working in New York with Cassevetes -- we were trying to do something important, shine a light in that darkened cinema --
-- Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
Spare me.
Almost right.
I don't know if that's going to happen.
If it's on the page...
-- I guarantee she won't gain an once.  She's very disciplined.
Which accounts for your percentage.  When do I get to meet this dream?
I'll walk you out.
Elaine, talking to you now, not as Viktor, director, but Viktor, ex husband... what the hell happened to you?
Viktor, you should have said something.
She said you were very beautiful.
No.
Excuse me?  Start?
Lainey and I just wanted to congratulate...
Is it Wednesday?  It's Wednesday. How embarrassing.  I don't know what I was thinking.  With all the excitement lately...  Am I interrupting something?  Are you expecting company?
I suppose I could stay, just until she arrives.
Not quite.
Not if I don't let her.
No... it's life.
Hello, is this Elaine?
Just a minute.
What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
Body double.
I'm fine, Hal.  How are you?
I've seen them all before.
-- a living, breathing actor -- I can't work with a fake.
I just came out to support my good friend, Simone.
Well, I can't wait to meet Simone... what's her last name?
I do.
I read.
You were the one who insisted on it.  Reading me Dostoyevsky and Joyce when I was four.
If anyone asks about Simone --
I noticed.
I could get the death penalty.
Maybe the reason she's with me is a little thing called integrity, Sayer.  Look it up.
I'd like to see that, Sayer. Invite me.
It's a yacht.
I don't have time for this, Sayer.
Abduction?
That won't be necessary.  Sooner or later I knew you'd crack this thing, Max.  You got me.
Dark?
My God, you've got one?
After I saw what Simone did with the role -- you know I fired all my people, went into rehab, took acting classes, changed my whole look.  She really inspired me.
Yes, I'd like that.
You'd cosmetically alter Simone to look like me?
Buy it?  They're paying for it. And around here that's how you really know they buy it.
You are birth of... what?  A Phenomenon.  A miracle.  A new era in show business.  All I wanted to do was finish the film.
They're my dad's. The lenses hurt my eyes.
...De profundis clamo ad te domine.
That's good.
How do you draw now?
Cause she doesn't look at me like everybody and I don't want her to. I don't want her to know.
That I'm a freak.
Yes.
Dr. Crowe.
No, walking around, like regular people... They can't see each other. Some of them don't know they're dead.
Will you stay here till I fall asleep?
Never mind.
Yes.
Someone else can help you. Someone else can make you happy.
You do?
I guess she did.
Don't get mad.
Maybe.
I'm ready to communicate with you now.
They did?
Oh my God.
Yes.
Standing next to my window.
They scare me too sometimes.
Dead people.
They used to hang people here.
They were the ones who hanged everybody.
Like what?
You shouldn't laugh at people. It makes them feel bad.
Chuck E. who?
J. C. Penny's?
Superstition.
Chicken blood on the crops.
Nope.
I ain't never played a banjo in my life.
Nikes? What-the-hail you talkin' about?
Tramp.
Keep your shirt on! I'm almost done!
No shit.
You're saying someone's trying to keep us on the farm...?
Suzie, face it. The only "axe" he's picked up since we came here... is a real one. He doesn't give a damn about the band anymore... or about you.
Missed you at church this morning, Jeremiah.
All right. "Fratricide". Minor technical detail.
...Guess it was her time to go. You can't argue... when the good Lord calls you home.
Pardon?
I --
He started it.
What?! You mean... I slept on this couch for nothing?!
Relax. He liked what he saw. Well, some of it. Enough to give us a showcase audition. One week from today.
Nah. Just you.
You brought us here. And that morning I found you in the barn. You had scratches on your face --
No. Not without you --
Never.
I was getting 'warmed' up.
Who knows? Just like a man... never around when you need them.
Comes with some Goddamn responsibility, like keeping your people in line.
Bill, we need to talk!
Hell, Jack, your leisure activities ain't my business.
Touch some deer feces out in the forest. Eat a sandwich without washing your hands. Then you got lyme disease.
Oh, yeah?
Starla, it ain't --
Bill, I'll run out to your car, call for paramedics from there.
Well, big ol' Lincoln, sure. Guess I would have flirted with him too.
He wants me, Bill! I'm going to get him to take me to him! See if you can follow me, and kill him!
I see. It's like as if he's going in a pattern. Is that what you're saying, Bill?
Shelby!
Your momma wasn't too proud when you came out neither, Wally.
Shelby --
Shit. You're kidding me. Nope. BRENDA Brenda! GRANT Hell, you were --
Fuck lucky. Never marry a damn half--Mexican.
Shut up.
Howdy, Mr. Grant. You goin' to the Deer Cheer this weekend?
How many you need?
All the rib eyes?
Grant, you're sick!
And you said the worms are part of him. They're all linked, like one creature?
Hey, look!
Margaret.
Not that I don't have any respect for the law, but what's your problem, man?
Your what?
What's the matter? Legend has it Bandit LaRue's king of the road.
How much style?
What do you think?
I gotta get back to Atlanta in thirteen hours.
A what?
Okay.
They're both a challenge.
Mattoon, Illinois. But I moved down south to work in the Civil Rights movement.
I don't know. Maybe Jerry Jeff sent the heat after us.
Believe me, there's nothing to be afraid of.
I don't know. We were planning on seeing the Astrodome.
Eleven.
I've never seen him before in my life. I'm just trying to help you out.
You could've asked.
The minute you see him, you'll know.
Yes.
That's me.
No.
Because they said it couldn't be done.
Save it. We got a long haul.
On two lane blacktop. Mile marker six-one. How we doin' on time?
On its way. Give me a coupla minutes, okay?
I ran into complications.
I'll believe it when I see it.
I'm here.
I'm cucumber cool.
What's that, pardner?
Go head on, breaker.
Thanks much, Silver Tongued Devil.
Bandit, this is Mister B, and I'm gearjamming this rolling refinery. You got another Smokey on the rubber?
Seventy-two five.  Why do you want this barley pop so bad?
Some boy named Bandit's been givin' the Highway Patrol shit fits.
That's a Texas bubble gum machine on your back porch.
You're soundin' real bodacious. Back.
Because I wanna see this hot shot Bandit do something that can't be done. Besides, there's nothing I like better than breaking legends.
And everybody, all the time. Yeah, it's a chore.
Well, we were worried about dust and debris from the work being done ruining the cameras, so--
Maybe.
All of 'em. His entire entourage. I think we should move.
Yeah.
The other agent. He said he was here to do an inspection and later, when he got on the elevator with the other guy, Carruthers, I saw him wearing one of our security jackets...
Yeah, he had the badge and everything. It said "FBI" on it.
Yeah.
Ww... uh...
And threw us into the lake.
Shoot, I appreciate that man.
Your attitude sucks.
Okay.
...to what? Incinerate? 'Cuz I'm almost dead certain there's not a fucking laundry detergent or dry cleaning process known to man that can ever return that jacket to its former glory! Some shit, suffice it to say, just don't wash out.  Now, the money question... To whom does that stain belong?
I was kinda hoping, yeah.
Only if you really, truly mean it.
Are you a fucking colossal idiot?
That's right! RIGHT NOW!
I thought Heller was a double op?
-- Your intel corroborates what we already know. Sparazza's health is in rapid decline and before his date with destiny, it seems he wants one last thing... The heart of his sworn enemy. A recently opened, cash rich escrow account has been traced back to Sparazza. This and the mention of this mysterious Swede makes the million dollar contract on Israel very real.
You think it's possible he could be involved in the Israel hit?
This is him? The hitman hired to kill Israel? He's a doctor?
...He does now...
Yeah, y'ain't heard the punchline, yet and before I get to it, one more thing I heard, little curious, should probably bring it up... Primo wants Israel's heart. The actual thing, the organ.
-- who can say. He's off his onion, y'know, he's old school Sicilian, this is how they hate.
Hey, we nab Israel, they pay t'get'm back, I'll cut the fuckin' thing out m'self, no extra charge. My thing is, we crew up, let's not fuck around, someone's cousin, some Zip off the boat from Naples, let's get pros, people who know how to behave.
None whatsoever.
Well, uh -- damn, alright, so he's headed in, does that -- where does that leave us?
You do the right thing. Sit with me while I heal, let it develop slow.
The try t'wild out on my boo and it's on and crackin'! I'm layin' niggas out.
-- I thought we had secure frequency. Aww girl, tell me this mafucka ain't goin' off right now.
What?
Hold up, hold up, I'm getting shots over the scanners, tons of traffic -- jus' chill for a sec, lemme listen...
Naw baby, they heard about that Triad hit, the work ya'll put in and they recognize the skills. And this ain't no tryout, tap-dance "show us your shit" thing neither -- if ya'll want this then I'mma go git it for 'ya.
No, no, no, y'gotta go in and get him, pull'm out of wherever he at, forget all that other shit, that's just f'flavor. I'm still getting lil' bits'a this-n-that from this cat Padiche, the man contacting me... Right now, what we got --  -- Is a number and a name... Buddy Israel.
What do you want?
It's not human, Kelvin.  Whatever it is, it's not human, and I am threatened by that.  Evolution-of- the-species-at-stake threatened. And I want to win.  I want humans to win.  So I am killing it before it kills me.
How quickly?
Yes.
He's dead.
He'll let me in.
Who was it?
Oh, that's a relief.
Will she come back?
I wish you'd told me.
Not necessarily.
Get out --
I'll be right back.
Book?
And tonight?
Stop it.
I am.  Please come with me.  I don't want to do this here.
What do you mean?
It's something.
You don't know?
Well.  He doesn't think it's God, but for different reasons than me. He's thinking: If I can figure out how to make it stop, than I am smarter than it is, and therefore it cannot be God.
It's a violent response to something we haven't figured out.  Don't let the cowardly demeanor fool you: He is ruthless.  Unblinking in his prejudice.
Rheya.
Gibarian.  He was here.
I love you.
Rheya --
You're lying.  I'm not human.
Neither did I.
Who are you, then?
I don't know.  Something.  Anything.
You must have been dreaming.
You go ahead.  Of what I remember about Earth... it's all one thing now.  Everything's a blur.  I like distinctions.
You didn't like him?
Then c'mon.  Follow me.  The art's in the basement, you're going to get a privileged peek.
It's okay... I've never been a detective before either...
There's a phone in the car.
Not too sure about that.
Ah... I shouldn't... on duty.
I'll come with you.
Urdu and Hindi.
Nope... never finished one yet.  I hate these things.
That's nice.  And you live in Queens?  With a child, and a dog...?
He's very caring, in his way.  You haven't seen him at his best.
Pretty far.  I'm told not to say anything about it on the phone, in case it's tapped... they think it's best, safer, if I go away, at least till Venza's found.
Do you dance?
Yeah.
I know.
Long enough.
"To"... Forget about you.
I don't know...
Unbelievably handsome.  You look fantastic in a suit.
I might stop you.
She didn't like the other one, so she picked this one.
Ellie, it was a formal party...
She bought it.
Did you hear what I said?!!
You heard me.
I'm sorry.
Well.  This'll be over soon. Venza's such a nut job, we're bound to pick him up soon.
If she identifies him.  Where the fuck were you anyway, cowboy!  Venza was meat.  He walked right past you, and now we're the ones playing catch-up!  You better hope she identifies him.
Call me next week.  We'll talk about it.
Koontz!  I need you guys!
Bad fuckin' news.  Even the families dropped him when they found they had a fruitcake on their hands.  But he knows where a lot of bodies are buried.  It'd cap it for Garber if he could bring him in.
I'll bring her in.  You let them go, and I'll bring her in.
My special, scrambled eggs surprise.
Yeah, I think so.
Okay, I guess.
She's taking singing lessons.
No, I'm not coming in.  And if you'd rather go to a "singing lesson" than have dinner with your father...
I don't think she can sing, either.
Be nice.
No. No, that's okay.
Nonot really.
Lemme down, bugface!
Get inside and get pictures.  Fifty bucks.
I don't submit to blackmail!  The first amendment protects my freedom to tell the news as I imagine it, and--
Hmf-hrr?
Uh-huh. Look, this should be skintight.  Bright colors.  Red, maybe a deep midnight blue.
Two suits by tomorrow for $400?
Sorry. I'm still getting the hang of this.
Thank God.
Maybe.  I could have stopped it, though.
"Flash," Liz.  You're going out with something that calls itself "Flash."
Hi, Adele.
You're not trained for that.  None of us are... I mean, sometimes I...  Okay, let's say you had gone back. What then?  Are you bulletproof?
Listen.  You think you're responsible for everything that happens.  Don't flagellate yourself - and don't flatter yourself, either.  You're not the center of the universe. You're just... Peter.
Hello.  So very boring.  Peter Parker, how do you feel about me this morning?
Precise equipment such as waldos
Oh, Peter. A zit.
Tofu.  Ben, I wish you wouldn't.
You were adorable.  The least you could do is use a glass.
Hi.  I've got sort of a hypothetical question.  Do you suppose the bite of a radioactive spider would transmit that spider's proportional strength and agility?
Yeah, a psychiatric hospital. Listen, I'm serious--
No!
Ach, theories!  This was first hand, experiential knowledge, the essence of the universe.
Oh, Roz.  My mind is so far beyond yours now.  I could beat you at chess now.
Hi, Professor.  What's up?
Actually, I got this spider bite
I don't think I'll be running into him.
I'll try. Thanks.
I just gave-- yeah, sure.
Just drop me off here.
No, but I've got this secret identity to worry about. I'll swing the rest of the way.
Phooey on that.
I'm not so happy myself.
Plenty.
Is you all good Nazis?
Any news on Dunbar?
There was that ammunition train in the depot at Frankfurt, see? So Dunbar gets himself in the men's room and fixes a time bomb, see? Then he waits until the train starts moving out, see? And one of the cars got the door open with some straw on the floor, see? So he throws it, see, and three minutes later -- voom! See?
Forget it. He'll be back here. They've got no proof.
Roger.
Coming up.
We'll get some more.
Who is it?
So long, Sefton.
You're all wire happy, boys. You've been in this camp too long. You put two and two together and it comes out four. Only it ain't four.
You betcha. I said one of us is a stoolie. A dirty, stinkin' stoolie!
You are talking crazy!
Twenty-five.
Just a minute. You made a couple of cracks before and I let them slide. But I don't intend to take any more. If you resent my having money, start a revolution, but get off my back.
My legs are frozen.
Not you.
Yeah.
He is a prisoner of war until you can prove sabotage.
Say, Schulz --
Raus! Raus! All of you!
Animal! Animal! Aren't you ashamed of yourself? A couple of guys are trying to escape and you're thinking of broads. Broads?
Why do you do this to me every morning?
Comrade! Comrade! Otchi Tchorniya -- Otchi Tchorniya!
Hey -- Comrade! Over here! This is Harry Shapiro -- the Volga Boatman of Barrack four!
Who wants to eat? I just wanna get over there!
I don't care if they wear galoshes!
You're teasing me again!
I clocked him this morning. He was running like a doll.
So what? There's other women!
It takes a gimmick, Animal, and I figured us a little gimmick.
Sharp. Sometimes I'm so sharp it's frightening.
What do they always say?
Hey, here's Esther Williams.
Why, sure!
And don't blame me if you all wind up in the cooler.
I want everybody out of here. We'll need a lot of commotion on the compound.
You'd better cut out in back of the south latrine.
Yeah? How would you like to see the guts of nine pals splattered all over your plane?  C'mon Joey -- don't be afraid.
I'll say it is. You spilled a little borscht on it.
Sure I heard it. I still got one good ear.
You did!
Don't you know? Because I got my own ideas.  Let's have that civilian stuff.
Just one little thing. How come you were so sure Manfredi and Johnson wouldn't get out of the forest?
They're lying dead in the mud out there and I'm trying to find out how come.
They know about that gadget. I'd worry more about the radio.
What about the radio?
Suppose you just sit down and keep your mouth shut.
Thirty-fifth.
Shut up!  Security Officer, eh? Screening everybody, only who screened you? Great American hero. From Cleveland, Ohio! Enlisted right after Pearl Harbor! When was Pearl Harbor, Price? Or, don't you know?
What time?
Ganz einfach... Streichhoelzer... und eine Zigarette...
How would you like to give Frau Schulz a pair of silk stockings for Christmas?
Who's the guy, Schulz?
Why don't we just plug up that tunnel -- with the Kommandant on one end and you on the other.
We'll put pink ribbons on the bedbugs.
A chicken?
Just don't drool on it.
Come on, let's get that mail. Anything for Stanislaus Kuzawa?
Oh! Somebody was peeking!
He is.
I wanted to save Geordi. I tried. But I experienced something I did not expect.  I believe it was fear.
Guilt. It is a most unpleasant feeling.
Can you project its course?
I believe so.
Approximately two hundred thirty million.
It has occurred to me on several occasions. But I believe this may be the appropriate time.
You get what?
One minute to warp core breach.
The station complement was nineteen.
All hands, brace for impact!
Oh yes. I remember everyone who was on the Lakul, every face. Even the ones who didn't make it.
What happened to you?
Your "sixth sense"- I've always wondered where it came from.  And what about Soran?
But why destroy a star?  Thank you, Guinan.
All of us.
Wherever he wanted to be.
It's our pleasure.
No, no. Thank you.
Yes, yes, it is.
She's not real either, is she? Nothing here is. Nothing here matters.
I hadn't planned on it.
And what would that be, sir?
I thought you might.
No.
Make it so.
We think they were looking for something- they practically tore the place apart.
No, sir.
As ship's counselor, it's your duty to know not only when you're needed but also when you're not.
Very well. I suppose I could make out my weekly report to Starfleet Command without your input.  "Admiral Lusby, regarding the unusual behavior of Jean-Luc Picard: I find him increasingly irritable, remote and uncooperative. I recommend forced shore leave at a Starbase facility in order to-"
The timing is very important on my experiment- if it is not completed within the next twelve hours, years of research will be lost.
Aye, sir.
If he tries to get away with Warp Drive, he's really in for a shock...
Execute!
I can't get an answer. Starfleet is up to its brass in galactic conference. No one has time for those who only stand... and wait.
Message acknowledged. All units will be informed.
Sir. Commander, Starfleet on emergency channel. He orders you to surrender this vessel.
Keep trying, Chekov. At regular intervals.
Bones... Can you give me a quadrant bi-scan?
What did you see, Chekov?
Dr. Marcus, it's your planet.
What is it?
Thank you... <u>Sir</u>!
Sector three... Sub-tropical vegetation... Temperature --  Temperature decreasing rapidly --
Underground deposit?
David --
Grissom, your message acknowledged. Will advise... Out.
It would seem that Grissom was destroyed by an enemy attack.
Logic indicates that is the case.
And Spock with it. They are joined together.
Affirmative, Captain. Our readings are well below danger level.
I'll try to remember that, Captain.
Request permission to beam aboard immediately.
Thank you, Mr. Scott. I'll try not to take that personally.  My friends... I can't ask you to go any further. Dr. McCoy and I have to do this. The rest of you do not.
They've knocked out the damn automation center.  I've got no control over anything!
Goodbye, David.
She's to be decommissioned.
The word is no.  I am therefore going anyway.
Go, Sulu!
Approach control... this is Enterprise. Ready for docking maneuver.
Oh, I'll have "Mr. Adventure" eating out of my hand. And I'll see you at the rendezvous.  All my hopes.
Any time.
Who is this?! How dare you --

No tricks, Kirk. You have one minute.
You should take the Vulcan, too.
Beam the Vulcan up -- And we talk.
If we don't help each other, we'll all die here!
"Met his death"?  How could you, his friend, have assumed that? Why did you leave him on Genesis! Spock trusted you -- and you denied him his future!
You missed the point, then and now... Only his body was "in death," Kirk! And you were the last one to be with him.
... Spock...
Yes... But -- how...?
One alive, one not. Yet both in pain.
Say the wrong thing, Torg, and I will kill you too!
But sir! Federation Starship approaching.
Perhaps they wish to take you prisoner.
I underestimated him... He did the one thing I didn't anticipate ... He destroyed himself...
I don't dispute that in the wrong hands --
But, as you are so fond of observing, Doctor, I'm not human.
That's all you have to say?
More antiques for your collection -- Cheers!
Four hundred years old. You don't find many with the lens still intact.
Thank you.
Bones, I don't want to be lectured.
Spare me your notions of poetry, please. We all have our assigned duties and...
At the moment that question takes a back seat to preventing him from laying his hands on it. You said it yourself; we're talking about a bang that would re-arrange the universe...
This one looks like a Steward. They're not warm, but rigor hasn't set in. This didn't happen all that long ago, Jim.
Young. I feel young, Doctor.
I'm sorry you feel that way, Doctor. Admiral Kirk's orders are confirmed. Please prepare to deliver Genesis to us upon our arrival. Reliant out.
Why? Why didn't you tell me?
The matrix formed in a day. The life forms grew later -- at a wildly accelerated rate. Can I cook or can't I?
I don't think there's another piece of information we could squeeze into the memory banks. Next time, we'll design a bigger one.
This is just to give us something to do, isn't it?  Come on.
Captain, this is the garden spot of Ceti Alpha VI --
What's the matter -- ?
Never mind! Hurry!
Marooned on Ceti Alpha V. He's completely mad, Admiral. He blames you for the death of his wife...
<u>This is Ceti Alpha V</u>! Ceti Alpha VI exploded six months after we were left here. The shock shifted the orbit of <u>this</u> planet and everything was laid waste. <u>Admiral</u> Kirk never bothered to check on our progress. It was only the fact of my genetically engineered intellect that enabled us to survive! On earth, two hundred years ago, I was a prince, with power over millions -- now, like Prometheus I have been left by Admiral Kirk to digest my own entrails.
I see. Helmsman?
She's making it up! My father was Professor --
How soon --
We'll beam aboard and stop it --
No. I -- I guess I'm not what you expected.
That makes two of us.  Lieutenant Saavik was right: you never have faced death --
So am I. My friends were killed, too.
Is that what you came here to say?
Only half of you would get there.
Oh, I believe it.
Khan, listen to me -- if its me you want, I'll have myself beamed aboard. All I ask is that you spare my crew.
I give you sixty seconds, Admiral.
I've given you no word to keep, Admiral. In my judgment, you simply have no alternative.
All is well, sir. You have the coordinates to beam up Genesis...
My sister's youngest, Admiral. Crazy to get to space.
Give the word, Admiral.
Aye, sir.
He'll die -- !
Admiral, this is Spock.
Midshipman First Class Peter Preston, engineers mate, SIR.
The word is given: warp speed.
I am understandably curious.
She's half Romulan, Jim. The admixture makes her more volatile than -- me, for example.
'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...' Message, Spock?
I was going to remind you of nothing, least of all that which you know well.  Your mistake, if I may be so bold, was promotion. Commanding a Starship is your first best destiny. Anything else is a waste of material.
Yes.
The power of creation --
Raise shields! Energize phasers, stand by to --
Best we could do in two hours.
Uhura, patch me in --
Lieutenant, self-expression does not seem to be one of your problems.
There is no correct resolution. It is a test of character.
HURRY.
On the test, sir, will you tell me what you did? I'd really like to know.
Aye, sir.
Aye, sir --
Try again.
Battle stations.
Best guess, Mr. Sulu. Fire when ready.
I'm aware of my responsibilities, Mister.
Ready, sir.
What did you expect, Lieutenant?
By the book...
Where must you go?
... They do, indeed.
Fine. Just fine.
Not at all. You gave me things to think about. You always do. You do sound a little wrecked, why don't you go home and stare at the ceiling?
What do you mean?
Dammit, Jim, they've made him into a goddam green-blooded computer!
Let's hope so, Bones. Mr. Sulu, set us down in Golden Gate Park.
Uhura is busy. I am monitoring.
It would be impossible to discuss the subject without a common frame of reference.
A joke is a story with a humorous climax.
Really? You think this is its way of saying "Hi there" to the people of the Earth?
That's crazy! Who would send a probe hundreds of light years to talk to a whale?
"Guessing" is not in my nature...
Reading the patient's vital signs.
My God, man, drilling holes in his head is not the answer. The artery must be repaired without delay or he will die! So put away your butcher knives and let me save the patient!
It gives me a great sense of danger. We have to beam in next to the reactor room, not in it.
Like what?
Dr. McCoy, you, Mr. Scott and Commander Sulu will convert us a whale tank.
And Admiral, it's the Enterprise.
Whoever said the human race was logical?  Now if you'll follow me, I'll introduce you to the Institute's pride and joy.
I suppose they told you that...?
To put it mildly. Since the dawn of time, men have harvested whales for a variety of purposes, most of which can be achieved synthetically at this point. A hundred years ago, using hand-thrown harpoons, they did plenty of damage -- but that was nothing compared to what they've achieved in this century.
I buy that. What about him?
Go ahead.
What does that mean, exactly? Take their chances.
It's his way.
They'll be flown in a special 747 to Alaska and released there.
Who do you think I am?
That's what you think.  Okay...Truth... I'm from what, on your calendar, would be the late 23rd Century. I've been sent back in time to bring two Humpback Whales with me in an attempt to... repopulate the species.
Noon tomorrow...?!
But Kirk...
They were taken last night. I wasn't told. They're in Alaska by now.
What are you talking about? I'm coming with you.
... You have a point...
You're going to your ship, I'm going to mine. Science Vessel. I've got 300 years of catch-up learning to do.
Why does it have to be goodbye?
Jim, Spock, Jim. Remember...?
A distinct possibility, Admiral. The President did say the transmission was directed at the Earth's Oceans
The sounds, but not the language. We would be responding in gibberish.
That would be futile, Admiral. The probe would neutralize us easily.
Admiral, if I may: we're probably already visible to the tracking devices of the time.
And they will be again, Spock. That's the beauty of it.  How much?
Ah... The giants.
No word since beam-in. We can only wait for their call.
In that event, the probabilities are that our mission would fail.
... Aye sir...?
Nothing... I should never have left him...
Bearing 327, range 600 nautical.
Give me one more day, sir. The damage control is easy. Reading Klingon is hard.
Appreciated by all, Mr. Scott.  Prepare for departure.
I suppose I can, sir; are you planning to take a swim?
Two?
Mr. Sulu?
The beasties seem happy to see you, Doctor. I hope you like our little aquarium.
Admiral, you'll be trapped!
Thank you, Lt. Saavik.
Klingon justice is a unique point of view, Mr. President.
... Yes?
I will be returning to Vulcan within the hour... I wanted to take my leave of you.
Tell her I feel fine...
Arigato. Sayonara.  Thank you, honorable sir.
Why?
But not you.
You don't live up to your reputation as an offlander, Picard.
More questions. Always the explorer. If you stay long enough, that'll change.
I just... haven't gotten around to it yet.
There are caves in those mountains.
This way!
You're what?
I understand.
I play the violin... and my chess routines are quite advanced...
The artificial lifeform was right?
Is it safe to move her?
What you're seeing is a computer driven image created by photons and forcefields...
Our procedures were in place to protect the planet's population from unnecessary risk...
Another time.
I know what Data means to Starfleet, Jean-Luc... but our crew is at the mercy of those people on the planet...
He's right. Our shields have been upgraded to protect against the environmental anomalies...
Talk... we should send down an assault team and take them by force.
In six hours, every living thing in this system will be dead or dying.
Sir, Commander Worf and I have been working on several tactical plans to safely...
You've done a terrific job, Jean- Luc. Now, pack your bags and get the hell out of there. How's Data?
I'll need all your paperwork tomorrow. We're heading back your way. Set a course to rendezvous with us so you can transfer the crew and equipment on your way out.
Delay the procedure. Let my people look at the technology.
There's nothing further to be gained from this...
Do you know how to disable the injector?
If we could lure him away from the bridge...
The shields in that section won't protect them against the thermolytic reaction...
Why would they fire at him without provocation?
... had regenerated.
I think it's the universal greeting when you don't like someone.
Eject the core.
How long 'til they reach us?
... so they need us to put out one more brush fire.  Anyone remember when we used to be explorers?
We won't be able to go any faster than one-third impulse in that muck...
You Klingons never do anything small, do you...
Worf, what the hell are you doing here?
It's good to have you back, Worf.  Slow to one-third. Take us in.
Make it so.
No, sir. It is a gorch.
Picard to Crusher...
No. We'll be responsible for that, Mister Worf.
We have to find shelter...
You should feel right at home with them.
Hmm, I should feel right at home with them...
Was I doing something to your neck?
We're here to find Zephram Cochrane. He may be injured or dead.
Jean-Luc, this man needs medical attention, now.
I'm saying they might shoot us on sight. You have to remember... these people have watched their entire way of life collapse around them.
Yes. But until then, you'll have to make do with what you've got.
How did Doctor Almack react to that?
Vulcan?
Today is March second, 2063. The time in Montana is oh-eight-forty- five.
I am unlike any lifeform you have encountered before. As an android, I am in complete control of my neural net. The information contained there cannot be forcibly removed.
Understood. Keep me informed.
Probably from the nuclear warhead. Cochrane was planning to use it to ignite the warp drive.
There should be an access hatch nearby...
I have the password right here.
There should be some kind of manual release...
We need to launch this ship in under eighteen hours...  There must be some design schematics... blueprints...
Get a tricorder. You're going to have to track my exact position in that room...
As they used to say... all systems are go.
Picard to Enterprise.  Picard to Enterprise -- do you read me?
Well, I feel a whole lot better with them out there. We may need some help.
We're crossing the threshold!
It'll be tight, but we should make it.
Active.
Great name. French?
You don't sound French.
There's a few of us left.
It wasn't a trick. I used to be an electrical engineer.
Yes, he is.
Yes... I wanted to ask you about some photographs I saw out at the silo. There were three of them... printed on some kind of fabric.
I can try.
Trade. Okay. The photographs... for a straight answer.  Who are you? And how do you know Zephram?
I'm sure it is. But it'll have to wait until tomorrow.
No. It's a lot further than that.
Aye, sir.
We have to follow them back... repair whatever damage they've done to that time-line.
Intercept course, full impulse.  Weapons status?
Incoming message from the Starship Intrepid. Admiral Hayes.
They appear to be modifying the deflector dish.
They're converting the deflector dish into an antennae...
Understood!
We've lost Bridge control!
Do we have any idea how many Borg we're dealing with?
Deflector dish... why the deflector dish...?
Any sign of Data, or the Borg themselves?
Captain, I've scanned the planet. The atmosphere contains a high concentration of methane, carbon monoxide and fluorine. The oceans have been chemically altered, as well.
There were no planetary defense systems in this era. Their weapons were designed to fight each other... not extraterrestrials.
At present I'm awaiting a full report from Enterprise. Pending that I am constrained to observe Interstellar Law.
The longer we wait, the less accessible the hostages will be, Mr. President.
I'm going too. They may need a doctor.
You may need assistance, doctor...
That's the question -
No more neutral zone. I was USED to hating Klingons... that's why I failed in our assignment.  It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word. Spock was right.
Uh uh. Somebody felt much worse. And I'm starting to understand why.
Don't remind me.
Now there's a poser.
In space, no one can hear you sweat.
I don't wonder. Stop me if I'm wrong but do we really have any way of knowing if this is the real you?
How can I trust --
That isn't true...!
I cannot confirm or deny actions which I did not witness.
Your honors, the State rests.
I know what you mean...
Torpedo bay! DID we fire those torpedoes?
Shields up, Captain --?
They'll be here...
Kill him! He's the one!!
There's a reward for your death.
Anything else you want to tell me?
Possibly.
WHO ELSE...?
Saavik, sir. We were told you'd need a helmsman -  ... so I volunteered.
Thank you. Lieutenant, one quarter impulse power...
Come on, Saavik, you COULD knock -
Sir?
I'm afraid we may need more than that. There's a Bird of Prey on the lookout for us. And she can fire while she's cloaked.
They're dying.
We've fired on the Chancellor's ship -
According to the data bank, we HAVE - twice...
Someone said the difference between comic and cosmic is the letter "S." You haven't outlived your usefulness - to me. And you are not responsible just because she is also Vulcan -
Spock, you want to know something?
Probably trying to figure out why we're reversing, wondering if we detect her.
Not from a distance. She won't show up on ANY type of scan.
Not as yet, sir.
Commander Uhura has been experiencing technical difficulties sir.
I don't want to.
You can't prove any of this...
You've betrayed the Federation - all of you.
Confirmed, Captain!
Negative. The subspace shockwave originated at bearing three-two- three, mark seven-five, the location is...  Praxis. A Klingon moon. Barren of indigenous life forms but -
What is it?
Mr. Scott, you forget yourself. Please accompany me.
I think  not.
This one can.
I believe I am.
Aye, aye, sir.
Maybe we should write them a letter?
But you didn't join a conspiracy.
Yes, please continue.
No. Can I move now?
It'll serve you right.
About twenty-five years ago. They probably used a hair follicle or skin cell.
Is he very much like you were?
Dying?
That was another time.
Yes. And, frankly, I envy them as well. They've made important choices; they're going to have great challenges ahead of them. New worlds to conquer...
Mister Worf, accompany Data please.
Sorry, sir.
Fire!
Of you?
He would deny a "human" connection is possible. He considers himself entirely Reman.
No, sir, it is not possible. The B-9 is physically identical to me, although his neural pathways are not as advanced. But even if they were, he would not be me.
I aspire, sir. To be better than I am. The B-9 does not. Nor does Shinzon.
Commander Riker, evasive maneuvers!
I can't believe the Captain went along with a memory download.
It seems to be a redundant memory port.  Maybe it's for provisional memory storage in case his neural pathways overload?
It's possible the extra memory port is interfering with the engram processing. Mind if I keep him here and run some diagnostics?
Don't give up hope, Data. I know, I know, you're not capable of hope.
Thank you.
Do you have a moment, sir?
You're speaking of emotional investment?
And I you.
I know how he thinks.
Make it so.
This isn't about me anymore.
When this is over, I owe you a drink.
This is Commander Donatra of the Valdore. We're dispatching shuttles with medical personnel and supplies.
What do we know about the planet?
Then how did a Reman get to be Praetor? I don't get it.
Set up a security program to detect any unusual data stream rerouting. If it happens again, we want to be ready.
Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. But he's got it, Captain.
He wants to look me in the eye.
The targeting sequence should take about four minutes.
Sir, we wont be able to bring you back. Its a one way trip. Captain, I don't know if the transporter...
I'll take care of it, sir.
There's more... as always. He's Reman.
Not with the Romulans.
Aye, sir
Your new chair, sir.
I appreciate your concern, Number One, but I've been itching to try out the Argo.
She's a predator.
Can anything be done for him?
Unless we can disable his cloak we're just going to be firing in the dark.
I promise you in time, she'll become your home ...If I could offer you one piece of advice?
No?
No. I was the first Picard to leave Earth.  It caused quite a stir, In fact. But I had spent my whole life...
I'm honored to think I might someday speak with such eloquence.
Think about what you're doing, Shinzon. Are you ready to plunge the entire quadrant into war to satisfy your own personal demons?
I'm incapable of such an act, and so are you.
We are.
And what of the Enterprise?
Childish dreams, Captain. Lost in the dilithium mines of Remus. I'm what you see now.
Two ships decloaking, sir! Romulan!
Should I raise shields?
Let's go.
Yes, Praetor.
Have the doctors prepare. I'll be on the bridge.'
They will obey, Praetor.
Silence, Romulan!
And mine is wearing thin, young man! We supported you because you promised action. And yet you delay and you waste your time playing games with Picard while--
Eh... yes.
Stay right there...
They must have picked it up in space.
There's no mistake? You're absolutely sure?
Get the body out of there. Load it on the Air Force chopper and get it to Wright Patterson. They'll take it from there... We didn't expect this, Shermin.
I'm going to the White House right now. I'll try and get you everything you need.
What do you mean by 'contain?'
We don't know what else to do. We need results.
George, listen to what you're saying. This thing's changed itself into a man. Disappearing may not be that big a deal.
You just do your job, Shermin. We'll make the policy.
What?
No. You'll want to ask a lot of questions I don't want to answer right now. I already have a ride.
Which way do you want to go?
No. I don't know what you are, but you're not Scott.
Yes.
A drink.
You better.
Yes.
I need you.
No.
No.
A baby is a new person?
Do you have a baby?
Why?
The car will stop?
Go?
Goodbye.
Yes?
We told our home, and the people who tell us what to do on my planet said to come and look but not to talk, not to land, not to shoot. Just to look from up there. We came and... the driver of my ship...
He will.
I am your friend.
Why?
I've noticed... Do you understand what they're saying?
Please understand. If you go this way, you'll never get to your ship. The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. I'll get you to your ship. I promise.
Come on.
I feel better if I move.
I used the last one to jump off the cliff...
Yes, they are.
You don't make money gambling. You lose it.
What for?
I understand.  Thank you.
I want to get money for you and the baby.
This is very interesting. We are born knowing our history. We have other books. But not a book like this.
Many, many days and nights...
You could have killed us both!!
Call the police!!
This is going to be a real drag. I thought you wanted to go fast.
What? No, of course not.
I wouldn't worry about it... There might not be any little league tomorrow.
Any reports about monsters, people in Halloween masks, anything like that?
Bell wants us to get down on our knees and bow.
Wait'll you see it.
It was a man though... right?
Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.
We will.  Something's wrong here. She's helping him now.
I must get to my ship, Mr. Shermin.
I don't want to hurt anybody. I just want to go home.
Hey, fuck you, man.
You're going down.
Oh my God.  I don't believe this is happening.
I know.  I don't always do exactly what I'm told.  So I said, 'Do you enjoy watching me?'  And you said -- come on Max.
'We might as well make the best of it.'
I just want to see what we're like together through your eyes.
Too bad about your guy Jeriko. Tough break.
No, Lenny.
I know you Faith.  You're afraid of something.  What's going on?
You understand?  Attorney!  Right? Am I right?
A virgin brain!  Well we're going to start you off right.  So what do you know about this?  Save us some time...
Exactly anything.  Whatever you want.  Whoever you want to be.  Fabri, get us another round, would you.
Okay.  It was funny.  But it cost me money.
Least you can do.
Thanks, Max.
Shutup a second!
I'm on her.
Yeah.  No, not really.
He stalks her.  He rapes her.  Then he does her...
He makes her see her own death, feeds off the reaction... killer and victim merging... orgasm and agony merging.  And he records it all.
Yup.  Hey, so I heard you dropped in on Tran last night.  Another slick Lenny move.
And who was, regrettably, also your best fucking friend.
I got ways, Lenny, I got ways.  Okay, okay... I got a deal with some a the paramedics.  My guy pages me and I pick it up at the morgue.  So whaddya think?  This clip's gotta be worth at least a grand.  Right?
Ha!  That's for fucking sure.
Skip the art criticism, Tick, what can you tell me about the wearer.
What clip?  What was it?
Faith, can I talk to you a second?
Sure.  Whatever.  See, since you shitcanned my career, I don't even have to call you sir.  One of life's small pleasures.
No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it.
Everybody needs to take a walk to the dark end of the street sometime, it's what we are.  But now the risks are outa line.  The streets are a war zone.  And sex can kill you.  So you slip on the trodes, you get what you need and it keeps you from jumping your tracks.
Define illegal.
Fumitsu.
Get it.
I've had it.  No more wirehead shit in my car.  You understand?  You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else.
Look, I gotta get some sleep.
She's my destiny.
Lenny.  Calm down.  This is what I do.
Fire's out, isn't it?
Yeah, right, blow it open.
Deputy Commissioner Palmer Strickland.  The sanctimonious prick who busted me out.  His ass is so tight when he farts only dogs can hear it.  I know this guy.  If there's one cop who's not dirty it's him.
Lenny... shutup.  Just park your mouth and listen.  It's a set-up. Think about it!  Why's he been sending you tapes?  To freak you, get you to rush in without thinking. Then they put one in you, put one in her, put the gun in your hand... crime of passion.  This guy's bent enough to think of that.
A cop?  You want me to trust a cop?!
Naw.  They just have to ask us a few questions... for about six hours.
Are you going to make me beg?
Sucks.  Hey, Bobby, turn that up.
Yup.  He was Jeriko's manager.  Bummer, Tran!  Lost your golden goose.  Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
Take the tape to the cops.
Um... he was older.
To be honest, when I'm working, I don't look at faces much. He knew the guy's name.
Pacific Northwest is a hotbed for serials.
Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all.
Well, the victim was killed at the turn-around over there, then his car was pushed over here...  ...right across the state line. That makes it Federal. This is Officer Wallace, he's out of Alamogordo.
Ten miles back on the Texas side.
I'd appreciate it if you kept this to yourself.
Winona.
I'm sorry. This won't take long.
I'm not in the mood for Native American wisdom.
Not as much as you'd think.
Sorry. I've seen you in here. Always lugging that case around.  Whatja sell?
Whole country or just hereabouts?
Fucking. I'm talking about fucking, Harold. You ever think of fucking other women?
Not bad, huh?
What do you want from me?
What kind?
What about his killer?
Just hospital talk. Nothing that connects to Speck.
What are you doing?
I had gotten their trust. We were sharing fantasies. I couldn't risk it.
Go ahead.
Had trouble sleeping last night, sir.
I don't believe this.
We need to put out an NCIC inquiry.
An oversight, sir, I apologize. I felt I needed to get away for a day. The pressure. Paid for my own ticket.
You're as crazy as he is! He's right! You don't give a damn about saving lives at all! Fuck you!
Thank you, Rangers.  Put this man in the unmarked.
Beats me. He just asked me to come along, double-check the forensics.  What did you do to piss him off?
This is no random killing, no one shot deal. The UNSUB has killed before; he's good at it. So what do we have?  We have someone who has killed before who kills someone who kills: a serial killer of a serial killer -- and who wants the FBI to know he exists.
"Gone live?"
You got a point there.
Sex.
Me too.  Make any headway with "Zorro"?
I was thinking, maybe we should ask Professor Daitz. Nobody knows this stuff better.
Don't be too harsh.
"Intra-Agency fraternizing."
I know.
No. Cut off while he was still alive, look at his wrists, damn near ripped his hands off trying to get free. Must have been screaming real loud when the killer chain-sawed his throat. Unfortunately, he'd soundproofed his van.
You found the body. She was one of Harold Speck's victims. In El Paso.  They're not just talking to each other, Mack, they're trading souvenirs.
You did.
What's up?
Suspect Zero.
It's too late for that. I've gone ahead of the curve on this one. There's no turning back. When this is over, Koessler is going to be right or Low is going to be right or I'm going to be right, but not all of us.
Yeah, of course.
Low calls him Suspect Zero.
I'm going to Amarillo.
Of course he does. Now get the key, get these things off me.  Unhook me.
I believe it is you, sir, who has us jumping through hoops.
He's moved on to TV.
You? You went by the book?
Lionheart here. I'm back. Sorry about the absence. I had to do some therapy at the crossbar hotel.
Lead the way, Murman.
[Not this way. Call it a little favor, call it a little thing I'm going to do for you. I'm going to make Chicago come alive for you. You'll owe me one.]
[The address is 147 South Rane. It's a lively address. You got a problem with dark meat?]
[Ask for Leslie. Eight days from tonight, exactly one a.m. Be there if you dare. You cannot fool the Murman.]
[Hello, Agent Mackelway. How's the watch? Maybe you can do one of those TV commercials, I found my watch under a serial killer's heart and it was still ticking.]
[I don't think so. We want the same thing. See ya.]
So you're the new meat?
Johnny, get this man's file. Mackelway, right?
Four hundred and sixty, sir.
Yes, sir.
The same.
MyDick. As in my dick. That was his screen name.
350 miles.
What is it exactly I don't understand, Agent Mackelway?
Perhaps you can explain it to him.  It's Agent Mackelway.
Brilliant? You think he caught any of them because he was brilliant? Hardboy? MyDick? Imelda? Ripper? Think about it, how did he locate them?  He found them as Murman. And how did Murder Man find them? With sweet talk and brains? No. He did it with souvenirs. He took them into private rooms, swapped goodies: pictures, panties, jewelry, body parts. Snuff downloads. As bait. That's why I never exchanged with him. He killed girls, oh yeah, harvested them. He had the best stuff. Richard Low is Murman and Murman is one of us.
It's over for you.
I'd say about two weeks.
You better pay the man.
Hi.
Hi, Mike. I'm Lorraine.
Yes. Like the quiche.
I thought real men don't like quiche.
Why? You're not a real man?
Just like that?
How was it hard?
What what? What advantages?
Yes. I mean, no. I mean, maybe he would find her, I mean you attractive. Maybe he doesn't like to dance. Maybe all he likes to do is just stand around and drink and smoke and look cool with his buddies who don't dance either...
Oh. You know.
I haven't heard an official "no" yet.
Did you get it?
Could you believe it?
I'm a comedian.
Six years.
Listen. I had a great time.
...The red piece of shit over there...
...Six months.
Fine... I guess. You?
...the Michelin commercial...
I heard you might be moving back...
I mean first you'll pretend not to care, not call -- whatever, and then, eventually, you really won't care.
Ah, see, that's the thing. Somehow they don't come back until you really don't care anymore.
No problem.
Look, there's not much of a call for Shakespeare in this town.
I didn't want to say anything.
I shouldn't, Mike, it's a weeknight.
It's kinda like a speakeasy kind of thing. It's kinda cool. It's like you're in on some kind of secret. You tell a chick you've been some place, it's like bragging that you know how to find it. The only way you could know where a place is is if someone who knows brought you there. You have to have someone come before. There is a direct line connecting you back to the original, unequivocally cool, club patrons. It's kinda like Judaism...
I've been around here six months and I still can't get over it.
Go for it, man.
I'll be your winger.
No. Just O.J.
She wasn't your type anyway.
Well, that's dumb.
Well, you're doing so well...
...for the same reason you miss her. You lived with it so long.
He's trying to be an actor.
I can't believe you.
What are they doing here?
She's really special, guys.
I just got out of a six-year relationship. Okay? That should help to explain why I'm acting so weird. It's not you. It's me. I just wanted to say that. Sorry.  This is Mike.
Wow, I guess you were home...
We're gonna spend half the night driving around the Hills looking for this party and then leaving cause it sucks, then we're gonna look for this other party you heard about. But, Trent, all the parties and bars, they all suck. I spend half the night trying to talk to some girl who's eyes are darting around to see if there's someone else she should be talking to. And it's like I'm supposed to be all happy cause she's wearing a backpack. Half of them are nasty skanks who wouldn't be shit if they weren't surrounded by a bunch of drunken horny assholes. I'm not gonna be one of those assholes. It's fucking depressing. Some skank who isn't half the woman my girlfriend is is gonna front me? It makes me want to puke.
When?
You're crazy.
Oh... Now Mikey wants to be a high roller.
Whu?
This is the hot new place, besides, you love pirates. Tell me Mikey doesn't love pirates.
Baby, there are beautiful babies here.
Did she, or did she not smile?
I'm telling you, they love that shit.
Who's fucking around? I'm not making fun. Let's do it, baby.
Don't give me that shit. You know exactly how much you lost. What'd you drop?
You gotta give Tee one thing. He's good with the ladies.
That's what I'm telling you, baby. The babies love that stuff. They don't want all that sensitive shit. You start talking to them about puppy dogs and ice cream. They know what you want. What do you think? You think they don't?
Respect, my ass. They respect honesty. You see how they dress when they go out? They want to be noticed. You're just showing them it's working. You gotta get off this respect kick, baby. There ain't nothing wrong with letting them now that you're money and that you want to party.
Yes!
No! Not the camera guy!
What?
How?
That's just plain silly. Your self- esteem is just low because she's with someone else. But thinking about it and talking about it all the time is bad. It's no good, man. You gotta get out there. The ladies want to love you, baby.
...Whatever. It's work. You're doing what you love. What's she doing?
See? And what does this guy she's with do?
What?!?
Please. And you're sweating him? You're "all that" and you're sweating some lawn jockey?
Baby, she's the one who should be thinking about you. Sounds to me like you cut loose some dead weight. Trust me, Mikey, you're better off.
...It looked money.
What?
That doesn't matter.
No...
You could make their heads bleed, though.
...It's on.
You're like this big bear with claws and fangs...
...and teeth... And she's like this little bunny cowering in the corner...
...Yeah. You're just gently batting it around... and the rabbit's all scared...
Now when you talk to her, I don't want you to be the guy in the PG-13 movie that everyone's pulling for. I want you to be the guy in the rated R movie who you're not sure if you like.
Listen. Just because I was the only one with the balls to stand up to them...
...it's on.
Six.
You owe the Don a service.  In one hour, not before, perhaps later, he will be at your funeral parlor to ask for your help.  Be there to greet him.  If you have any objections speak now, and I'll inform him.
Good.  From me you'll get Justice.
I want you to use all your powers, all your skill, as you love me.  I do not want his mother to see him as he is.
Go back to your house and wait for me...
Barzini.
Your girl friend.  She says she can't make it tonight.  You lousy bastard you have the nerve to give your whores my telephone number. I'll kill you, you bastard!
OK, OK.  You gonna make me something to eat at least?
Like hell I will.
OK, but be careful.
The gun will be there.
No, I don't want to give Barzini an excuse to start fighting.
Then in a six month time we're on our own; is that it?
Sure.
Drive while you thinking; I wanna get to the City this month!
OK, go to Arthur Avenue; I'm suppose to call when I found somethin'.
Why do you come to me?  Why do I deserve your generosity?
What percentages for my family?
So.  I receive 30 per cent just for finance and legal protection.  No worries about operations, is that what you tell me?
And with prison record.
Tattaglia is a pimp.  He could never have outfought Santino.  But I wasn't sure until this day.  No, it was Barzini all along.
Maybe I can help.
For killing a man.
No.
I want children, I want a family. But I don't know when.
I could accept everything that's happened; I could accept it, but that I never had a choice.  From the time I was born, you had laid this all out for me.
How?
Michael, why must you do this.  We have been lucky so far, all these months you've been here we've kept your name a secret.  It is from love for your father that I've asked you never to more than an hour from the Villa.
No...I would like to walk to Corleone.
Shhhhh.
He had business at the hotel, but he'll drop in for dinner.
Mike!
If Luca sold out we're in real trouble.
Without your father's political contacts and personal influence, the Corleone family loses half its strength.  Without your father, the other New York families might wind up supporting Sollozzo, and the Tattaglias just to make sure there isn't a long destructive war.  The old days are over, this is 1946; nobody wants bloodshed anymore.  If your father dies...make the deal, Sonny.
OK forget it, just stay on the phone.
McCluskey can't stay with the Turk forever.  We'll wait.
Sonny will come after you with everything he's got.
Even Sonny won't be able to call off Luca Brasi.
Did he give you his politicians?
I told you I had a lot of relatives.
Al Capone!
As long as I tell him beforehand he won't object.  He'll be hurt, but he won't object.
For dinner.  Unless I call and tell them we're still in New Hampshire.
I'm thinking about it.
Huh?
Please say it.
OK.
Don't you want dinner first?
Let me think about it, O.K.?
How's Mom?
Sollozzo is a dead man, I don't care what it costs.  I don't care if we have to fight all the five families in New York.  The Tattaglia family's going to eat dirt.  I don't care if we all go down together.
The kid's right.
I want to settle things tonight.  I want my father left alone.
Yes, I promise.
Your casino loses money.  Maybe we can do better.
You're unlucky.
You took Freddie in because the Corleone family bankrolled your casino.  You and the Corleone family are evened out.  This is for business; name your price.
Hell, he was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time.  Players couldn't get a drink.
Do you recognize my voice?
Right.  Don't say my name, just listen.  Somebody shot your father outside his place fifteen minutes ago.
I think so, but I can't get close enough.  There's a lot of blood. I'll try to find out more.
Well, we ate everything without you.
Yes, Tom Ripley's here.
Is that good?
I don't get it.
Did you speak to my father?
No, I like him.
It's the one task Dickie can do on his own -- make coffee.
Yes please!
Okay.
It's always the same whenever someone new comes into his life -- Freddie, Fausto, Peter Smith-Kingsley -- he's wonderful -- did you meet him, he's a musician? -- ...and especially you, of course... and that's only the boys.
It's Tom. Tom Ripley. We were at Princeton together.
Stop! It's too much! You're making all the hairs on my neck stand up!
Your parents met her.
Sure. I love Venice.
See Venice and die, isn't that right? Or is it Rome? You do something and die, don't you? Okay, Venice is on the list.
Copy out from here...
Pretty vile. See this: The S and the T, do you see? -- fine, vulnerable -- that's pain, that's secret pain.
No!
I can't. I can't keep spending your father's money.
You said I could pick out a jacket and I just... Sorry.
Is Freddie here?
I was just fooling around. Don't say anything. Sorry.
I don't know! Why are you asking me?  How can it take an hour to find an ambulance?
I'm not going to say anything -- to Marge, or anybody, the police -- It's a secret between us and I'll keep it.
Do you even like jazz -- or was that something for my benefit?
Oh God, I don't think so.
Tom, I don't love you.
You can be a leech -- you know this -- and it's boring. You can be quite boring.
What evening?
Ciao bello.  Don't you want to fuck every woman you see. Just once.
Hey, if I'm late, think what her husband's saying!
I don't think so. Come back with me to Rome. There's this great new club. Have some drinks, lotta ladies...
What are you doing?
I don't think he's at dinner at 6.30pm. If you said he was still at lunch I'd believe you. Incredible. The guy has disappeared off the face of the earth.
Have you done something to your hair?
Far cry from New York.
Hello, sir.  Marge, you should have waited, didn't Peter tell you I'd come by and pick you up?
Hello Tom. You're off? What are your plans?
Bird. That's jazz.
He's not a man, he's a god.
So I'm learning.
Tom, you startled me! You're back.
What does that mean?
Is that what he said -- he wanted to be alone?
Errand number one -- deliver Marge's perfume. Errand number two, pack some clothes and his precious saxophone.
Search me. I guess we're abandoned.
No.  Hello, I'm Tom Ripley.
Dickie did it.
Hello Marge!
Let me put on some clothes and then we can talk about this.
Marge, calm down, you're being hysterical.
Shut up! Shut up!
Why do I think there's never been a Ripley rainy day?
I hope so.
No, nothing. I'm just thinking about when Tom arrived in Mongi.  And now look at you.
Excuse me?
Randall.
How did you know that?
Just kidding. Are you alone?
Where have you been since then?
They found this in Dickie's place in Rome.
Ten thirty?
Not at all. Morning Tom.
A Roma, circa tre settimane fa.
No.  By the way, officially there are no Italian homosexuals. Makes Leonardo, Michelangelo very inconvenient.
He says so many fiancées.
Don't you put the past in a room, in the cellar, and lock the door and just never go in there? Because that's what I do.
You look ghastly, Tom. Are you okay?
You try. You try talking to her.
What do you want to change about this moment?
Well that would be even better gossip.
I know. I'm lost, too. I'm going to be stuck in the basement, aren't I, that's my, that's my -- terrible and alone and dark -- and I've lied about who I am, and where I am, and so nobody can ever find me.
I suppose I always thought -- better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.
You're such a liar...
Yes, if it's going to help, certainly.
May I ask... why would you speak to your friend and not your fiancée?
Good. The Goldoni. Yes -- you're right. A coincidence.  I look forward to our next meeting when I will be more careful with my English and persuade you to play me your saxophone. Alto.
I want a .32. Revolver. And a palm gun. That .22 there.
Sure, here, take this card, go to this place and give 'em the card. They'll charge you, but there won't be any hassle.
Huh?
Oh, uptown. You know. Some joint. It ain't much.
Just people people, you know. Just people.  Had a dead man once.
I shut the meter off, for one thing. I knew I wasn't going to get paid. Then I dropped him off at the cop shop. They took him.
Late one night. About three. At the plaza.
What?
I'm no pusher, Betsy. Honest. I never have pushed.
Oh. Who was that again?
I don't follow music much. I'd like to though.  Honest.
No.  I thought maybe you could play it for me on your player.
No, these are the kind that couples go to. They're not like the other movies. All kinds of couples go. Honest. I've seen them.
Keep it.
Thank you, Travis.
The senator's white paper is almost ready, Bets. Should we wait for that?
More people watch it.
Kidding around... you know, fun.
I don't know -- but it feels like a long time.
Ah, yes, the guy at the newsstand, Mr. Asbestos...
I know that guy. His hand looks like a paw. An old Black guy, the newsstand at --
Awh, come off it, Pal.
Ask Travis. He's the ladies man.
Yeah.
And what happened?
We call him Dough-Boy cause he likes the dollars. He'll chase a buck straight into Jersey.
Fuckin' Mau Mau land, that's what it is.
One-Ball McCall?
Yeah. Hey thanks. That's real nice, Travis.
I don't want to make it. I came here to get you out.
I musta been stoned.
Oh, come off it, man.
Don't you want to make it?  Can't you make it?
You can do it in my mouth.
I was stoned. That's why they stopped me. When I'm not stoned, I got no place else to go. They just protect me from myself.
I understand, mister. It means something, really.
That's not hard to do.
Didn't you ever hear of women's lib?
I... I don't get along with people like that.
Besides, I've got to stay here.
I've got something important to do. I can't leave.
Do I look like a narc?
Cops don't do nothin.
The Empire State in fog means something, don't it? Do you know, or don't you? What is your number, cabbie?
I'll tell you, Travis, I've learned more about this country sitting in taxi cabs than in the board room of General Motors.
No Sir.
You want to work uptown nights?
How's your driving record?
Physical? Criminal?
Well then check back tomorrow.
Why?
Oh?
Shit.
Hey Wizard.
Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up. Just heard it on the radio.
It happens.
You want to talk about it?
That record company.in Nashville wants to hear my demo tape.
You think I'm too...  ethnic for country music?
Shit, shit, shit what time is it.  Hello.  I'll be downstairs in ten minutes.
Archbishop of Canterbury.  Imprisoned and executed by Henry the Second ...
What do you have, a FUCKING WATER PISTOL?  Get him back!
I'm a field agent.
Where is he sir?  RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.  What's he doing?  HE'S ON THE= PHONE.  I DON'T FUCKING KNOW, HIS STOCKBROKER! Oh shit.  Gotta go.
Womack ripped it up, right?
You know, it's going to take me a while to get used to calling you Pete.  Pete.  Pete.  It's a nice name.
Delly... thanks, thank you.  I'll take good care of this.
Mr. Chairman, as I understand it, the Fifth Amendment pertains to self-incrimination, and I can't incriminate myself because I've done nothing wrong.  Besides, incrimination is why you have Mr. Clyde working for you.
Well...
No, I... I just wondering where you've been all this time.
Yeah, a little.  I think you grew an inch or so.  And you've lost weight.
Why me?
And why not?
You... don't remember, but yes, ever since I was a little girl.
Actually, I was married.  For four years.  But... well, we didn't fit together.  I'm divorced now.
Nope.  Just filling in the blanks.
Well, I'm sure we're all glad to see you came through it all right.
Yes sir.  But I didn't go to Lawson to run The Bijou, that was... that was something that just happened. You see, I was involved in an accident in Lawson, and I spent some time recovering there.
Referring to line thirty-seven of the document, does your printed name and signature appear there?
We see it.  For the record, it reads "Lucille Angstrom."  What's the point of this?
I... I need a drink of water.
Or the Bijou.  Either one.
Harry, son.  Harry.
Albert Lucas Trumbo.  But you've been "Luke" since you were a baby.
Can't wait.
Ah.
Hmmmm... after you left, it was difficult, and then Lily -- that's your mother -- she took ill and died... we haven't shown a picture since forty-eight.
You know, I hate to bring this up, but screens and uniforms and paint and repairs are going to take money, which I'm willing to bet none of us has.
Oh, hi Cue... Carl.  Sorry.
Goodnight, son.  'Night, Delly.
They're...
You're not going anywhere, Harry.
The G-man?
Pete, if J. Edgar Hoover walked in here wearing a dress, I wouldn't know him.
Then I'll call you a cab.
I guess I did.
It's possible.  I just don't remember.
Wouldn't blame him if he was.
Who the hell is this "they?"
Leo, I was trying to impress a skirt.  You know me, I'm non- political.  Republican, Democrat, Communist, there's not a dime's worth of difference between 'em anyway.
Leo, you're my agent.  Tell "them" to take a flyin' piss.  I didn't do anything wrong.  I fought in the war, for crissakes!
"Ashes To Ashes?"
Yes.  Leo, goddammit... this isn't fair!
And I won't be a communist anymore.
So it doesn't make any difference that I'm not one now, and have never been one.
Besides, I don't even know if I want to write anymore.
What do you mean?
Well, that's not what they think.
Climb down off your cross.  They already knew about her.  She was subpoenaed six months ago! Who the hell do you think named you?
When was that?
Oh dear, yes.  You were an excellent student, before all that clarinet nonsense.  You loved Chopin.  You used to call it "heaven music."  "Teach me some heaven music," you used to say.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh...
'Course they all know me.  And I know all them.  Town's got my name, don't it?
The war...
Thank you, Mr. Lawson.
I already have.
The one who lives in the white house across the bay?
They seemed sure it was either Alice or Lois.
It's a lovely garden.
Lovebirds.
Yes.
Where are you from originally, Annie?
Afraid of any woman who'd give Mitch the only thing Lydia can give him -- love.
She already has a daughter.
No, that's all right, I don't mind. I came up here for two reasons. To begin with, I was bored with my job in San Francisco. I was teaching at a private school there... well, you know, you probably went to one yourself.
Then go.
They're birds!
Oh, I suppose so.
Take it into the living room, would you, hon?
Yep.
Right across the bay there.
Yes?
Yep. Mitch and the little girl.
Nope. That's the road. Straight through town, stay on your left, right around the bay to the front door.
Mmmm.
Mmmm.
Near the top of the hill, you'll see the school and right behind it, the church. You head for the school. Now just past the school, you'll see a little house with a red mail box. That's where Annie Hayworth lives, she's the school teacher. You ask her about the little Brenner girl.
They're back!
Let me have some apple pie, Helen.  Who said anything about war? All I said was that some gulls...
No. Here's fine.
Yes, lovebirds. We couldn't let you...
I'll pick you up, Miss Daniels. Where are you staying?
I suppose so. Her father owns a big newspaper in San Francisco.
Yes, Mother.
That's a chance we have to take.
Shhh. Shhh.
But they'll be back.
Where can we go, Mitch? There's no place to go.
Oh, thank you.
I don't mind, really.
Did you close the door?
Yes, but the curtains were drawn.
Didn't know how he got in there. Had a broken leg, turned out. Just fluttering all around there.
No, you got quite a mess here, I'll admit that.  Maybe you oughta put some screening on top of your chimney  Seems a little pointless, though. Freak accident like this wouldn't happen again in a million years.  You want some help cleaning up?
I'd hold the birds for him, but I'm going away myself. Someone's got to feed them, I suppose.
What?
Yes. I understand there are different varieties, it that true?
These are for my sister... her birthday you see. As she'll be eleven and... well, frankly, I wouldn't want a pair of birds that were too demonstrative.
Aren't these lovebirds?
I suppose not. Is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages?
Are you sure you wouldn't like to see a canary instead? We have some very nice canaries this week.
That's true. I'll rephrase it. I saw you in court.
Do you remember one of your practical jokes that resulted in the smashing of a plate glass window?
Ahhh, but I really do want those birds.
Right. I recognized you when I came in. I thought you might like to know what it felt like to be on the other end of a gag. What do you think of that, Miss Daniels?
Not everyone, Miss Daniels.
What for?
I'm sorry.  Who's your friend?
Yes?
Well, well, small world. Annie Hayworth.
I was! And all I get for my pains is a... a... a hole in the head!
I'm sorry. I couldn't possibly...
Then it's settled. What time is dinner, Mother?
He was watching a ball game on television.
With all my clothes on!  The newspaper that ran the story happens to be a rival of my father's paper.  Anything they said...
No.
It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner, I think you need those lovebirds, after all. They may help your personality." That's what it said.
With my little sparrow leading team.
It was like that yesterday.
After the gulls attacked.
It makes you feel as if they're... they're waiting or... resting... or....
...everything I know.
Don't let's take any chances.
The past fifteen minutes.  It seems to be a pattern, doesn't it? They strike and disappear, and then they start massing again.
It may not be last week again for a long long time.
Maybe.
Well, this one won't be a chick, will he?
Yes.
I have no idea.
There is very definitely a difference, Miss.
Thank you.  Do you know Dan Fawcett's number?
I hardly think a few birds are going to bring about the end of the world.
No one called it a war!
Do you believe it's true, Sebastian?
Then help me, Sebastian. You're an important man in this town. If you'll help, the rest will.
I'm not sure, but...
They made some mess, too, smashing into houses and everything.  They always make a mess. We're better off without them.
Then let's go. Now!
Put on your coats! Do you want to get trapped here?
Good.
Did he tell you about Georgina?
Good morning, Mr. Fettes.
I can't do that -- you heard MacFarlane.
Where can I find him?
But I must tell him -- he must know of it. Please -- tell me where he is.
At Pennycuik.  I know the inn.  I can be there in an hour.
Come in, boy -- come in.
You're made for a doctor, young man!
You're too good a man, Fettes -- I'll not let you quit.  I'll make an assistant of you -- that'll pay your keep and your tuition, too --
I'm sorry for the woman, Fettes. But her son might be alive today had more doctors been given the opportunity to work on more human specimens.  As for me, Fettes, I let no man stop me when I know I'm right -- when I know that I need those lifeless subjects for my student's enlightenment and for my own knowledge.  And if you're a real man and want to be a good doctor, you'll see it as I see it.
You're a man of the world, Fettes, you wouldn't hold me to promise given in drink.
Look here, Fettes.  Not I nor anyone else knows enough about the spinal column and its intricacies to insure success in such an operation.  I would have to study the matter.  Have we any "subjects"?
I'll have no more to do with it. I'll not put my neck into the noose, not even for your sake, Dr. MacFarlane.
I am not at the school anymore. I left last night.
A doctor?
You will not have it?
That's a good boy, Toddy.
That has nothing to do with it. We've decided to do more lecturing and less dissection -- it's better for the students -- that's all there is to it.
In the brain, I tell you. I know.
I've ordered nothing from you.
Would you bribe me to leave you be?
Give me money or I'll tell the police you murder the "subjects."
Burke them?
No, Doctor.  She seemed to get better, then about six months later she began to complain of pain in her back --
There's nothing I can say for one small child?
You're wrong.
We're getting there. Because in his so-called construction job, Tommy makes a daily delivery to a place called "The Hole."
Who are you?
A job. Construction. Twelve an hour.
I know her friends.
My dad was right! He said you'd ruin her life.
When Lauren was missing the police came to our house. They said they were looking for her, right?  But I know now they had her, and the reason they brought her here and knew the could blame it on you...
Yes I do, I really do.
So you're going to kill him?
It's what Lauren would do.
I don't know. I found him lying there.
No matter what happens... you're innocent... I promise...
Erin. I'll always be with you.
Could say that.
Look, I'll tell you the truth. Jannie drove us and was supposed to drive us back, she has a license, but I mean... look at her.
What did I say?
Erin. I know you think she's been talking to you.
Watch out!
The cop who found the knife in Corvis's car.
That guy in the cemetery today said he knew everything about Lauren.
He said he'd prove it.
I talked to most of them this morning... They were all very curious about the meeting.
It isn't faith that makes good science, Mr. Klaatu. Its curiosity.  Sit down, please. I have several thousand questions to ask you.
That was my first question.
If you mean that you are afraid of us--
I'm sure I'll be quite safe until the meeting.
I'm afraid you have no alternative. In such, a case the planet Earth would have to be--  --eliminated.
Professor Barnhardt.
Sure we did! He wasn't there but we went to see him. And Mr. Carpenter showed him how to do his arithmetic.
What do you mean, dear?
I couldn't go to sleep, Mom. I had to tell you!
Yes, I have!
Gee -- I don't know... The space man, I guess.
He lives here in Washington, doesn't he?
I shouldn't be at all surprised.
Well, sure I would, but --  Aw, I'll bet you'd be scared.
He doesn't know the answer. And he'll never get it that way.
Is it different where you've been?  Don't they have places like this?
No -- I want to take you to the movies.  Do you think they'd accept these?
Why -- the light in my room went out.  Thank you, Bobby. Goodnight.
And the lungs are the same as ours. Must mean a similar atmosphere -- similar pressure.  How old do you think he is?
Their life expectancy is a hundred and thirty.
Sit down, Mr. Harley.
From another planet. Let's just say that we're neighbors.
I'm afraid, in the present situation you'll have to learn to think that way.
This is not a personal matter, Mr. Harley. It concerns all the people on your planet.
I traveled 250 million miles. What about your United Nations?
The first two years of television we were convinced that all you did was wrestle.
Apparently I'm not as cynical about Earth's people as you are.
I can judge only by what I see.
A good insurance salesman wouldn't give you time to think.
Is it real?
All right, Tom -- it's true. I know it's true.
That's what I'm trying to tell you. We mustn't do anything about it. Believe me, Tom, I know what I'm talking about.
I'm not going to marry anybody.
Jittery is the word.
He has his homework to keep him occupied.
Oh -- they just wanted to ask me a few questions. Bobby and I tried to see Professor Barnhardt in the afternoon, but he wasn't in. Apparently they thought I was looking for secrets of some kind.
Goodnight, my dear.
May I walk out with you?
You see -- the electricity's been neutralized -- all over the world.
I can see no other hope for your planet. If the meeting should fail, then I'm afraid there is no hope.
Back to the boardinghouse. I'll be safe there for the afternoon -- and I can keep an eye on Bobby. He's the only other person who knows anything about--
Where is the meeting going to be?
I -- I thought you were--
You mean he has the power of life and death?
We came to see Professor Barnhardt.
There are no diamonds like this -- any place in the world.
I'd give you a very good price.
I was only trying to be helpful. He was having difficulty with a problem.
No -- I'm afraid not.
They would have killed this man?
Get going, will you, Brady -- before I get mad!
This one could save your life.
You better get some fresh air.
Yeah.
You gotta drive!
I've only got one question for you, and I want an honest answer.  Have you taken any human victims yet?
That's just the way we like it.
Those two we brought back with us. The girl and the kid.  I don't trust 'em.  I say we terminate 'em while we can.
Maximum body-count.
You don't have to beat me, Michael.  Just try to keep up.
Good idea.  Marko.  We're hungry.
Hey, take it easy.
For a ride.
To free you, we must destroy the leader of the vampires.
Your dog knows flesh-eaters when he smells 'em!
A big legal war wasn't going to improve anybody's situation.  We've all been through enough.  Besides I was raised better than that. Thanks for having us, Dad.
Whatcha doin' over here?
No.  Just you.
No.  I'm up.
Okay.
Gotta go, Mom.
We can't talk about it on the phone.
Ah... I didn't know you were having guests...
Vampires, Mom!  Everywhere! You've got to tell the police! The newspapers!  The TV stations! They'll listen to you.  They'll believe you...  you're a <u>mom</u>!
Mom!
I'm not looking for a tape.  What I need is --
You're thinking of the groom not seeing the bride before the wedding.
Boy!  <u>Somebody</u> areound here sure has bad breath!
Our batting average isn't very good is it?  So far we're zero for two.
Boys Sam's age need a good deal of discipline, or they walk all over you.
I thought you said they needed discipline?
Don't be a baby.  That didn't hurt and you know it.
Have to sleep.  Have to sleep, Michael.
Not yet... You're like Laddie and me... Half-vampires... You're not a full vampire until you've made your first kill... You were supposed to be mine... but I couldn't, Michael.
Save Laddie first.
What would that make Mom?
No.  Why?
Wanna go to the comic book store?
Piss off.
I don't know, Michael.  This is not like breaking a lamp or getting a 'D'.
The Marines.
Dogs don't eat each other.
It was a life form that was able to imitate and reproduce, whatever it ate or absorbed, cell for cell.
Well, after I worked on him -- thought I'd let him rest.  Left the room for a bit.  When I came back, he was gone.
Don't know.  Looked for him for a bit... couldn't find him.
Nothing.  Nothing at all.
Maybe.
Finish what?
... You think this Thing wants to become an animal?  Dogs can't make it 1000 miles to the sea.  No skua gulls to imitate this time of year... No penguins this far inland... Don't you understand?!  It wanted to become us!
Look Blair, maybe you're right about this.  But we've got to be rational. We've got to talk this over.  I'm unarmed and I'm coming in.
I don't know who to trust.
What's it going to do, being a plant?
Childs, you got the torch?  You get your ass in here!!
Look, I'm just guessing...
Now how's this motherfucker wake up after thousands of years in the ice, huh?
That's good enough.
What?
... Where is everybody?!  I'm half frostbit!
Then I'll have to kill you.
Now Copper, you tie Palmer up.
I think so.
Damn you, MacReady!
In this weather?
What's that?
Well, stick with it.  I want you at it round the clock.  We got to get help in here...
What are you talking?!  He's had two months training in those choppers!
Move it, Palmer.
Mac, where the hell is that pump!!
Why?
What are you going to do?  Drink it?
You crazy?  He might be inside already?
Calm down and get in your position.
Who else could have used that key?
Right.  Half of us awake at all times.
What else can they do?
What kind of stories?
This is it?
Who doesn't know the Morlocks?
It was meant to.
This is the way in?
Imagine that... seems that little devil got my power relays...
What can I do?  Tell me what to do.
I don't understand.
Because the past is immutable. Frozen.  Dead... And you are the past.
When a creature shows too much independent thought we remove them from the gene pool.  We're breeding them for submission.  Soon they will be fully domesticated.
A man can change his history.
Because...
Ahhh... I'm afraid I've got a prior commitment.
You know I can't.
And what do you propose, Professor? Shall we hold a seminar to study the problem?
I need... to talk to you.
Shhh.  Let's just hurry on here. We don't have to talk, all right?
Alex, it's just the zoo.
Tonight's the night?
You may not like it, but this is the world we live in, Alex.  Little grey men with little grey hats.
What?
That's how I knew we were destined to be together.  When I met her parents for the first time I came right from class and I was covered in chalk.  They sniffed and snorted, but she just smiled.  At that moment -- I just knew.  How did you know with Molly?
Do you have a romantic bone in your body?
Perseverance.
That's because I'm working.  You remember that?  You used to care about your work.
You don't know that.  You couldn't possibly.  If I'd only done this, or that, if I'd arrived ten minutes earlier, or later.  If we'd taken a different path or I hadn't fought the man for the ring.  You have no idea what it is to relive every moment of that night -- consider every action you made -- and every one of them wrong.
Why don't you come to our house instead?
You're dying here.  Don't you see that?!
In a week... we will never have had this conversation.
Thank you...
All right, all right -- here -- everything --
Thank you.
Mm.
I know it's hard to believe, but it's true.
Thank you...
You can see so many here.
Not like this... They don't seem so bright with all the city lights.  I never really noticed them much...
We all have that dream.
Thank you.
What's it all for?
Most things.  We're very high on purpose.
What are you?
You know this?
So you can use it now?
Mara...?
Then if Emma turns me down will you marry me?
Exactly correct, sir.
What are your people called?
No...
No, I mean someone considerably older.  Your father perhaps?
Then it's time to change that --
Young man, we have a way of doing things here.  Radical theorizing is not acceptable.  Have I made myself understood?
You supported his application, Dr. Philby.  You are his senior, advisor.  I depend upon you to restrain his... excesses.  Any repetition of the behavior I witnessed in his classroom today and there will be consequences for you both.
Now you are upsetting my fowl. Please go.
Then don't.
I wasn't pausing to see if you did. [Beat] But, incidentally, you should, because you're birds of a feather.
How?
No, we were patients.
You just told me. The last time I was with you was when I was in the Jacket. I'm in it right now, Dr. Becker.
That's too bad.
Sure.
[Beat] What do you need me to do?
What about Dr. Becker and Mr. Gries?
Mom, this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway. The guy you yelled at for no good reason...
Yeah, I'll hitch a ride or something. [Beat] Let her throw it all up before she gets back behind the wheel.
Well, you belong in one.
I'm sorry for upsetting you, [beat] but I'm not lying to you.
[Beat] What?
I'll leave. But look at me. Look at my face, Jackie. I'm not lying. I met you and your mother. I told you then that I'd lost my memory. [Beat] There was no one for miles around so I know you know there's no way I could have known that from a pair of dog tags you had lying around.
Yes.
It's not a prison, it's a hospital. There's got to be some way out of there and you've got to find it...
They're not.
There're no cars on this street.
[Beat] I don't know.
William, you're not making sense.
You're bleeding pretty bad there.
I fell down. [Beat] But I'm alive.
He just said...that I'd shock Eugene and then things would change for him.
I still don't either, even after all these years.
You're not crazy.
That conviction doesn't convince me of anything. Until I know that I did it, I'm not going to accept that I did.
I could try to...make it stop.
So it's helping?
[Beat] I don't know.
Come on. Tell me what you do know.
Well, what time is it?
I didn't see that much of it -- same as now. I only saw it as part of my own life.
Maybe.
How...how do you know?
You have nothing to fear, William.
What for?
No. Listen to me...the kid, Eugene...
Who told you this?
Don't you go to jail for that?
No.
[Beat] Thanks.
I'm not sure. [Beat] I don't really know.
[Beat] I was dropped off.
Nothing. [Getting up] Thanks for bringing me this far.
Yup. That's me.
Shit happens, and your life changes. 'Bout the best explanation of a lot of things that happen. [Beat] So how come you don't know where you're coming from?
[Beat] Why?
Never knew my father. I grew up with my mother. Actually, I grew up around my mother. She was great though. I mean, the way she was with her friends... She was this woman who had so much life in her, she had to find ways to kill some of it just to be like the rest of us. [Beat] She died young.
She fucked herself up day after day and then, one day, she fell asleep with a burning cigarette. [Beat] I came home from work and she was gone.
I'm sorry, Doll, I just didn't want you to be late.
Uh-huh.
Well then, it's a good thing you're not regional manager and I am.
No you won't.  You'll be back today. Now!  You get your ass back here, Thelma, now, Goddamnit.  Thelma, do you understand me?
What?
Yes, baby?
Well, maybe if they were trying to hurt you or one of the kids.  I'm sure I could shoot someone if they tried to hurt one of the children.
Honey.  Nothing's impossible.  You just don't shoot someone like that for no reason.  Maybe he was askin' for it.  Anyway, somebody's husband probably got ol' Harlan.
That's Thelma Dickinson's husband.
You might say we had a meeting of the minds, yes.
Hal, I've told you about twenty times, yes, I could identify 'em, but neither one of them was the type to pull something like this.
Is there any reason to believe they've left the state?
Why don't we go ahead and let the bureau in on this.
Tell us about him.
I know!  I'd tell you if I knew! Goddamn!  I know something happened, or she wouldn't have left.  I'm trying to remember everything!  Find that fucking kid.  He probably knows something.
The important thing is not to let on that you know anything.  We want to try and find out where they are. Now I don't want to get too personal, but do you have a good relationship with your wife?  Are you close with her?
What's wrong?
What for?
Well, first you pick your place, see, then I'd just sit back and watch it for awhile.  Ya gotta wait for just the right moment, which is something you know instinctively, that can't be taught.  Then I'd waltz on in...
Who's your friend?
Don't mind me, Jimmy, I'm just a wild woman.
Hi.  I'm okay.  How are you?  Long time no see.
I know.  Call me back.  Louise, I love you, okay?
Peaches.
That's the code word.  I miss you, peaches.
Damn, Jimmy, did you take a pill that makes you say all the right stuff?
You mean you haven't asked him yet? For Christ sake, Thelma, is he your husband or your father?  It's just two days.  For God's sake, Thelma. Don't be a child.  Just tell him you're goin' with me, for cryin' out loud.  Tell him I'm havin' a nervous breakdown.
Okay.  I will, too.
In case there's some escaped psycho killer on the loose, who cuts the electricity off and tries to come in and kill us.
We'd have to.  That thing barely makes it down the driveway.
Isn't this fun?
Tell me somethin'.  Is this my vacation or isn't it?  I mean, God, you're as bad as Darryl.
Tell them what?!  What, Thelma? What do you think we should tell them?
Just what is that supposed to mean?
Hmmm.  We gotta get some money.
Well, when you figure it out, wake me up.
No, I didn't tell him.  And that's something we gotta get straight. Darryl's been callin', mad as a hornet, makin' all kinds of noise. When you talk to him, you cannot say anything about this.  You gotta make sure everything sounds normal.
You know how I feel about Texas... We're not going that way.
Taking a shower.
Don't worry about it.  You want anything?
Maybe.  Maybe.  The call of the wild!
Yes!  I believe I am!
Try to.
What.
You're right.
Oklahoma, Thelma.  We're crossing into New Mexico.
Oh, I don't know, Thelma.  I guess maybe we could turn ourselves in and spend our lives trading cigarettes for mascara so we can look nice when our families come to visit us on Saturdays.  Maybe we could have children with the prison guards.
I guess I always thought the worst thing that could happen would be to end up old and alone in some crummy apartment with one of those little dogs.
Gosh.  It sure is.
Just ignore him.
Okay, Louise... It's okay.
Shoot the radio!
No, Louise, you said the first part. I said all the rest.
No, Thelma.  I'm not gonna make any deals.
Eeuww.
About two hundred and fifty miles.
Louise... no matter what happens, I'm glad I came with you.
You too, sweetie, the best.
How do you stay so positive?
What?!
Go?
So you admit it?
Hitchhikers? I don't know -- fifty... a hundred maybe -- Who keeps track?
Woogie, I caught you red-handed.
Oh, Mary, honey, you're taking this all wrong.  I'm not leaving...
Good-looking?
Yeah, right.
I also called Unsolved Mysteries.
What? On your day off? Do you even know the guy?
Remember our friend Healy? Well, I didn't know where to mail his last paycheck so I sent my assistant by his mother's apartment. Turns out there is no diabetic mom. Landlord said she's been dead for ten years.
Don't you see? -- Healy lied to us about everything! The landlord said when he got back from Miami he kept talking about falling for some doctor named Mary!
No! You've gone through way too much to back down now. Get over there and do something -- I can't stand watching this.
Car clean? Plenty of gas?
Mints?
Hm?
Pipes? What are you talking about?
I'm usually too tired to be.
Huh.
You stole her from me. Now I want her back.
But but you're married. You have kids a great wife.
Who?
Oh come on, why would I lie?
Truth is I usually get along better with animals than with people. In Nepal the villagers call me 'Kin-tan- tee', which means 'man who is loved by many animals...  ...who love him a lot, too... and so on.'
Thanks.
I'm doing okay.  I gotta get ready for work.
Not for me, buddy. I don't drink anymore.
Is that right? Well good for you, Sull, I'm proud of you.
Healy, what I just tell you?
You found my car?!
It's right there on your golf bag.
Some buildings I'm working on.
No, I mean
That sounds like fun.
Here you go.  What's that smell?
That...? Vestibule.
Sadly, no. Well except for the lint.
Why bounce when you have your own condo in Nepal to go to?
A fucking moron.
Come on, what were you going to say?
Warren!
Not to worry. So... see you tonight, right? Right?
Uh, hey buddy. Oh boy, am I pissed. You're not going to believe this -- well, you'll believe it, there's no reason not to -- but I just got beeped for emergency surgery. Well, um, sorry, but I'm going to have to bail on you.
Well, I know you're busy...
Ted? Don't you want the name of the housing project?
Yeah, this insurance business is too slow for me. I'm going to go down and try my hand at jai alai.
I said buttplug. She's heinous.
Do what?
Same here.
Harvard?
You mean him.
Nice smokescreen, isn't it?
Did you build the Estadio Olympico?
I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with it. What style?
What do you mean?
But... but you knew people at Harvard.
Four.
Nah. I'm... I'm nothing.
Think about it. You walk into a video store and you see Eight-Minute Abs and right next to it you see Seven- Minute Abs -- which one you gonna spring for?
Ugh, not pecs. Sounds like one of those guys with a fish-net shirt and a banana hammock.
All right for awhile? The guy's good- looking, rich, witty. He was a god.
Is that old crab still with you? Mary, you said you were putting her up for a month -- it's been a year and a half.
Bet your ass I have. It's an important job, Neighborhood Watch is.
These ain't strangers, they're neighbors. This only picks up signals in a half-mile radius.
That's because there's a lot of bad people out there. Hey, Puffy tried to warn you about that Steve guy you was seeing -- he was a fucking asswipe -- but you had to find out for yourself, didn't you?
Why?
The little shit lied to me about that guy!
Where would I have seen your work?
Thanks, but I've got to be going. Unfortunately, Doc, this isn't a social visit.
Well... I've got a little more news about your friend Healy.
I've got a friend in the Boston police department. He faxed me this this morning. I'll just give you the highlights.  After a short stint as a petty thief, Patrick R. Healy graduated to armed robbery by the age of fourteen. At sixteen he committed his first murder -- a pretty teacher's aid named Molly Pettygrove. He was incarcerated until age twenty-two when, despite a grim psychological profile, the state was forced to release him. In his mid- twenties and again in his early thirties he was suspected of homicides in the states of Utah and Washington. Unfortunately, the bodies were so badly decomposed that there wasn't enough evidence to hold him, and on and on and so forth and so on.
No, a couple of the players and me were joking around and, uh, I fell off the school.
Just a minute.
Yup, that's right. Junior prom... kinda.
Really? I never got a message.
Well, lucky for me I found out. Thank God I have friends like Tucker.  Look, I'm sick of talking about stalkers.  Let's talk about you.
Well... to be honest... I'm really crazy about you and it's making me nervous and when I get nervous I'm not myself and I'm afraid I'm going to doing something really dumb before we get started so I think I should just lay back until I regain my composure.
Yeah, sure.
Wait, hold on, Mary -- it's not as bad as it sounds. I certainly didn't know --
Oh yeah, that'd make golf real fun -- the guy doesn't even drink beer or gamble.
Really?
What do you mean?
Teddy, be brave.
Yeah, I'll bet you all were. Come on, in the truck.
What are you doing?
What --
With all due respect, Mr. Secretary, we were not firing on the ship. Firing on a ship means attacking the ship. We were not attacking the ship. We were firing over it.
Of course. Our pledge can be relayed to any government official Secretary Khruschev sees fit to satisfy.
Tomorrow...
That's all well and good, but what do we say to 'em?
...I know. CIA and the military fucked us on the Bay of Pigs.
Rescind the order. Can all the Chiefs. Put Nitze, Gilpatric and the Undersecretaries in charge.
He better. Because nobody thinks he's up to this. Nobody.
What does the letter say?
So now you've got to talk him out of it. And then we've got to figure out an acceptable political solution.
Yes it is.
Yeah.
Says what, Kenny?
So I understand you correctly. If the missiles in Cuba were dismantled, returned to the Soviet Union, and a guarantee was made not to reintroduce them, the United States would be prepared to guarantee that it would never invade Cuba?
And, of course, the U.N. must be allowed to observe the redeployment of forces from the American Southeast.
Yes, sir. Our best option is to commence the strikes before the missiles are operational. The invasion happens eight days later.
I don't know, Helen. I want you to keep the kids close tomorrow. Leave the T.V. on, sleep with it on in the bedroom until I tell you you can turn it off.
Nothing. Nothing you don't know about. Tomorrow's the big day. Just have the car ready to go if I call or if the Civil Defense Warning comes on.
I'll be evacuated with the President.
I said his heart, not his attention.
Well, you know how Bobby has it in for the State of Mississippi.
Not as far as the election goes.
Good.
Have to hope it's a signal that he'll back down on the real issue too.
Okay, Ken. We're going.
Of course it is. But the President needs to realize we're going to have to stop a ship eventually.
Listen to me, goddamn it. We're talking about a possible nuclear war. You dropped the ball on Bay of Pigs --
That may be what they want us to think.
You're my hero, Carl.
Don't have one, Carl. I have a number, man. Just like the numbers on those treasury checks. You stole from your own country, Carl. Shame on you.
Our police are afraid of them. Please get them out of here.
Hey, Brooks, come over here. I want you to meet a coupla fellas from Denver.
James Looks Twice?
Your good friend Leo Fast Elk.
-- don't "man" me, Jimmy. Where's the key?
Leo's been out here too long, man. I'm taking him to ceremonial burial.
It ain't Geronimo.
No. No, that's Ray, here. Ray, uh...  Ray... Little Weasel.
Good. Thank you.
You ain't gonna cut his hands off and send 'em to Washinton, are ya? They done that to one of our girls once. Leo did quillwork, he's gonna need his hands.
-- did you understand me when I said that --
His mother needs a piece of his hair. It's for the Keeping of the Souls Ceremony.  Has to be kept for four days.
You crashed my file?
Cooch. You're my hero.
One of the leaders of the Warriors of All Red Nations. Militant organization.
Let's see it.
Cooch. What's the Fort Laramie Treaty?
I just wanna make sure no one else gets done in that way because we were in bed with the wrong doer.
All I could think of was... not here. I don't wanna eat it on an Indian Reservation, three thousand miles from home.
Well, she's running now, too. These fucking people like to run, don't --
Yes.
The Little Walking River. You're right. This is part of it. So whoever sunk this car didn't compensate for drought. Goddamn.
Why?
You didn't tell me about Red Deer Table --
Let the press through.
-- Leo wasn't killed here. He was dumped here. Out of a vehicle. Bald tread. Muffler held on with baling wire.
Thank God. Now listen to me, asshole. I'm giving you a break. But if my partner finds out you're here, you're gonna be reading rat tracks in Sioux Falls Maximum Security.
Let's go.
Why should I tell you.
The owl is a messenger. When one shows itself to a Sioux... it means someone's gonna die. The owl told him about Leo.
I don't see the connection.
Ray --
Likewise.
What are you talking about?
Crow Horse, listen --
Nowhere. I'm trying to find her.
Ain't prayer flags, that's for sure.
He's looking at a few hundred years in Leavenworth. He's not gonna come out without a fight.
You're not gonna catch him. He can shape-shift into different animals. Bear. Elk. Porcupine.
You're the FBI. That's your job, isn't it? Ya know how many of our Warrior brothers got killed out here? I never saw any investigating then. Why now? What's going down here?
I'm from Minneapolis. Fifth Street. I did four years at Dartmouth before I ever set foot on this res. So I know about the other world, Ray.
Okay, Ray. I'm coming in. If he starts to leave the area, move in. And hold him. Over.
Come back?
-- yes, Teton Sioux. Father's side.
They sent me here, Richard because they said you didn't hold up your end of the arrangement, and I have to transport you back to Leavenworth.
All I know... is I did what I did... and I ain't in solitary, gettin' pumped up with downer, gettin' beat to shit. But I tell you what, Suit. Take me back. Cuz I can't take this shit no more.
I'm with someone.
How did you know this was my car?
I saw one.
No.
Apology acknowledged.
Uh hum.

Winston Churchill.
All you've got is one life. I guess it's worth about the same to every body. You ever see an old woman after her husband has died? And the meaningless years of decline stretch ahead...  When you're in the air and doing something really dangerous, you can look ahead... maybe ten seconds. That's your whole future. That's as far as it goes. But imagine what those seconds are worth.
Thanks very much.  Care for some suchi?.
I don't know. I don't like being out of control.
And now?
. Yeah!
Why, what's gonna happen?
Where'd you get it.
I'm fine.
He was a friend of mine. A good guy...great guy. It was my fault.
What do you want?
What?
I like to play "reality".
It's like strip poker, only, without the bluffing.  One person says something and if the other one accepts that it's true, the one who says it, gets to take one item of clothing off.
I was, later.
I didn't want to see you. I mean, I did...but I didn't..
I hope you find him.
Sir. You are going to give me a warning, Sir!
Remember one thing.
These guys are getting on my nerves.
What?  What is it?
No! Now we're inverted!
DIDN'T ... AHHH...LOOK GOOD.
Not anymore.
Roger, I've got it.
Yawing right.
Just relax.
Why Goose, whose butt did you kiss to get here?
I think, yeah, we'll show you a thing or two.
Could use a dash more jet fuel.
Is there anybody in the Navy you don't know?
What, been drunk? Sure! Plenty!
Yeah, he's married--but then again, he,s not dead.
Look, Ma, top of the world!
I've had enough...for now.
Don't chew it, you won't have it that long. Easier to clean the cockpit if it comes up in big chunks.
I'm gonna take him, Goose.
I want him!
Come on. I died enough for one night.
They should have warned you about that one.
What'd you do?
Was.
Skipper, you can't do this!
Well, you'll just have to make do with him .
Thirty seconds. That's all it took to blow us out of the sky.
GOT 'EM.
SHIT!!
FIRE, OR CLEAR OUT, ICE.
NO, I GOT HIM. I CAN TAKE HIM.
No. You can be mine!
I think I can work it out on my own.
Didn't everybody?
Yes sir.
Ahhh... Runs in the family, sir.
Then why are you here?
No bother.
I don't know...
You think I should quit?!
I know.
I'm nothing like him.
I never heard that.
He ain't got five kids to feed.
Yeah...Well, actually no...Sort of.
Whatcha doin' to me, man?!  I got six kids to feed!
But maybe you can change all that.
Who are you?
May I use your pen?
Fuck you.
He's lying.  Hauser turned against you.
Get your story straight.  This idiot's been trying to kill me since I went to Rekall.  --You don't kill somebody you're trying to plant.
My friend, five minutes from now, you won't give a shit about the people.  Fire it up, Doc.
Yes, sir.
What is it?
It's not my fault.  We hit a memory cap.
I'll do what I can.  It's getting messy in there.
It's a symbol.  Of your desire to return to reality. --Inside your dream, you'll fall asleep.
This is Richter sir...I've got them pinned down.
We don't have much choice then, do we?
Cohaagen found something weird inside, and it's got him scared shitless.
You tell me.
Yes, you do.  That's why we brought you here.  --  Cohaagen's big secret is buried in that black hole you call a brain.  And Kuato's  gonna dig it out.
Yeah, you did.  I told you not to but you did anyway.
What the hell is this?
How did I get in this taxi?!
The brunette.  The one you told me about.
But I'm always home by morning.
Do what?
Just think about it.
Cohaagen says it's just a few extremists.
I'm late.
Bye.
Some men just tried to kill me!
Oh God, Doug.
I swear to God!...I never saw you before six weeks ago!  Our marriage is just a memory implant -- agghh!
Doug...You wouldn't shoot me, would you?  After all we've been through?
Right.  That's why you tried to kill me.
What are you talking about?
I didn't lose it.  Cohaagen stole it. He found out that Hauser switched sides,-so he turned him into somebody else.  Me.
Then he dumped me on Earth with a wife and a lousy job and ...
Kuato wants to see you.  Come on!
Jump!
I saw them.
All sorts of things.  You might even remember you loved me.
Of course not.  If Mars had an atmosphere, he's lose control.
I just has a terrible thought...What is this is all a dream?
Damn, you know, those kids turn up oil or uranium or something out there...next thing the Feds will be at our door.  "Sorry, time to move. Eminent domain."
Ready as we'll ever be.
You can't fight'em that way...
Cannon fuse.
I think I scared it!
I'd go for penetration.  The 458 shooting solids -- less ammo to carry anyway.
Damn it!  They'll sink this rig just like a boat!
Well, who put you two in charge?
Well, I'm scared, but I'm not sorry.
VAL, STOP!  THEY'RE COMING!  DON'T MOVE!
You bet.  You gonna be staying up here?
I was in one.  A bolt of lightning blew up cottonwood tree.  Three hundred head going hell-bent for the horizon.  Wasn't so damn funny, I can  tell you.
What the hell do we know about seismographs?
We could.  We could.  But we'd have to get <u>really</u> serious.  It's gonna cost twice as much to rent a place.
Car wash?!  That's got no future. If we're gonna take the plunge we oughta have a better plan than that.
Adios, bridge!
Fifteen lousy bucks.
Great.  Thank you.
You got <u>that</u> right!
Okay, now, how far's your truck?
Me, too.
First let's see if Stumpy's still out there.
Well, that's why Edgar never got down off that tower.
Right.  We need to be talking about what we're gonna do.
I'm gonna help you.
Not yet, not yet...
She wants to lay down.  I'm a little worried.
Yeah, Val.
Yeah, Heather, we got you.
God, what a stink!
I didn't do it!  What's going on?
Yeah.  One, two, three...
Why do you all keep asking me?
Yeah, good!  Something to keep them busy.  We need a decoy.
He was your snitch.
Correct.
Absolutely.
No it is not, Mr. Dowd.
-- With objection!
-- I don't care who you are. You could've been killed. Every man and woman in here has done hard prison time. And we look out for each other.
No further questions.
We had a description of the suspect.
Of course.
-- The Nazi he knifed?
I feel much better now.
1530 Rivington Street.
That's why I hate experts.
Hey -- you believe what you want. Shu Kai Kim is innocent.
I've got a meeting in Chinatown.
What's Art Esparza?
You phoned up Art Esparza's wife?
Everyone else was wrong and the one fucking lunatic was right!
And I call your testimony hearsay. I have no more questions for you.
Beats getting paid in twenties by slimedogs selling angel dust to high school seniors.
I don't know. The truth, maybe.
When I joined up I took an oath of secrecy. I told you what you needed to know.
See-cil.
Don Reynard.
Your client is guilty. Don't dick around with me.
I'd have that checked, Mr. Reynard.
What am I looking for? You're the one talking deal.
That's right.
You know you're very tense, Mr. Reynard. Y'oughta take a week off, fly the wife and kids to Oahu.
Didn't this investigation, with its attendant publicity, catapult you into the office you now hold?
-- Eddie told you?
-- What trial?
-- Roger --
Mr. Ortega... What is "La Compania"?
That's right.
Chinatown. Sounded pretty cold...
Mr. Stipe. A young man named Jimmy Chin was shot to death eight years ago, in Chinatown. Do you remember talking to the police?
Albert.
A woman.
I'm glad you let me talk to you. You used to not let me talk to you.
I want you.
I want you to kill for me.
I want you to kill for me.
Bobby... ssshhhh... you killed Mike.
Baby laxative? We can't snort baby laxative.
I'm not... Bobby I'm gonna need some more stuff. I mean it. I'm out.
Sure, but I can't get it till after school tomorrow.
You're lucky I am not wasting you.
I am going over here.
More popular than Uncle's Day at a whorehouse.  GOD DAMN, THAT MORNING SUN IS BRIGHT! BLUE BRIGHT.
That's right. That's the best coffee you're gonna get around here.
Smell something fishy, huh?
No, sir, we did not.
Sorry to hear it.
I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks
Did she ever mention any friends?
What do you mean?
Code. If you work with Gordon you learn that right away.
Shorthand. Really?
How do you figure?
What do you mean?
Right, which is probably why Lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation. Let me ask you something, Stanley, did you notice anything about the dress?
He talks loud. And he loves his code.
Gordon would not have sent us to Deer Meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation.
That's good.
I don't know, Sam.
Sure, but let's finish up with this first.
We're not. You and I are going to get some food.
In that case, we should go to the Canyon Trailer Park.
Thanks, Sam, for the good work. You have a good eye for detail.
Okay, this test is going to be about the theorems I told you about last week. You remember the...
When?
Donna, are you my best friend?
Yes, that's what I want. Thanks D.
No, I want to smoke.
Donna, you are a muffin.
Nothing.
YES YOU DO, DONNA. What a downer you are!!!
I can't help you there.
Brother, I hear you talkin'.
But Bob isn't real.
What does Bob say?
Laura, no, I'm not. I'm not Bob.  Poor Laura. I wish I could help you.
But you're strong Laura... so much stronger than I... How can I help you? I can't. I can't even go outside.
I already made you two tapes.
I'm dealing with it, Doc. Big time. Maybe I'll make you a tape tomorrow. Goodnight.
What? She asked about my father?
No, it doesn't... just kiss me.
Not now.
I just can't, James. I can't do it.
You know it and I know it.
I do love you.  Let's get lost together.
Eating?
Sex?
You know, I did come home, come to think of it, on Thursday. I had a severe headache and I was driving in the neighborhood so I just darted in and out of the house.  Where were you, Laura? I didn't see you?
Who am I?
Come off it, Leo. I'm late for work...
There's no one here.
Yes.
...yes. Get her on the phone...
Gruber...
It's a crime.
No.
I... yes.
After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in. He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form.  And he told me to change the form. He told me to change the one to a nine.  Or else, or else, he said...  He said he'd fire me. He said I'd never work again... Who were these men...? Who were these men...? I wanted to be a nurse...
Just as you are, Sir...
I'm on the staff of...
Yes.
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
...We did everything we could...
I doubt we'll have to go to trial...
It's completely done on a contingency basis. That means whatever the settlement is I retain one-third... that is, of course, the usual arrangement...
Hold on a second.
What you thought!? What you thought... I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred...
I understand.  I went to the Bar Association. They tell me you're going to be disbarred.
...I made a reservation at...
The Doctors were not negligent.
...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
Is that what a good doctor would do? How old are you, please?
Yes? Galvin, right?
Why?
What are they going to do? Not invite me to their Birthday party...?  Look, I gotta go. I have to be in Cambridge...
To do right. Isn't that why you're doing it?
You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
Why is that?
Thank you for seeing me.
No, no, you listen to me. All I wanted in this case is an even shake. You rushed me into court in five days... my star witness disappears, I can't get a continuance, and I don't give a damn. I'm going up there and I'm going to try it. Let the Jury decide. They told me Sweeney he's a hard- ass, he's a defendant's judge. I don't care. I said, the hell with it. The hell with it. I'll take my chances he'll be fair.
Noted. Thank you.  Miss Costello was a rebuttal witness. Her sole rebuttal was the document, which has been disallowed...
Still looking.
The TV didn't work.
Laura.
And is that what you're going to do?  Is that what you're going to do...?
They, uh, they got to my witness.
If I don't 'grow up...'
From the magazine?
Missus...
...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me?
And ask me what?
Who says that I'm protecting anyone?
...fifty thousand dollars?
...I understand...
Yes.
Don't touch anything.
...I'm going to need your help...
They killed her. And they're trying to buy it...
What?
...he's a good man...? He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness... he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis... don't fuck with this case.
We've got her sister. Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point.
Oh shit, what's today?
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
I'm swell.
Yeah. I'm awake.
The 'History'...?
Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...
I don't want a mistrial.
I, what are you talking about? I talked to her this morning, and she said...
You saw Kat in New York...  ...or is she in town? Is she in town...?
Yes, that's correct.
We, we were rather busy...
As I've said we had some more...
The Big Boy did...?
That won't start no more fires.  We might's well go home.
Wait a minute - wait a minute!.... Bombs don't unscrew.
We could show 'em we're friendly, huh?  Walk out there with a white flag!  Here - I got an old sugar sack in my car!
Madrid has just blacked out!! Nothing more coming through.
All right - I've seen enough!
There was a girl with them...If I could find her....
Didn't you have something to do with this?  I know you sent word to the Sixth Army Command!
You never know where you're going to wind up when you go to a square dance!
Can you handle one of these?
No.  The air's going to be full of Jets in a minute...And there they are!
I bought it for the square dance. I thought I ought to wear some- thing Western.
But they seem to murder everything that moves...!
But you're not going to.  You're not the kind.  You're tired, anyway.  You've been up all night.  You cracked up in a plane.  Slept in a ditch.  But you want to know something?  It doesn't show on you at all.
I could wear it longer -- but it's less trouble this way.
That's the kind of a kid brother you'd have!
How could it happen to everybody's watch together?
Not all.  Radio is out.  But our field phones are okay so far.
They'll probably move at dawn.
It was nearer than that.
There's a square dance at the social hall this evening.
I've done about all I can do here. You go back in.  Sylvia - I like that Doctor Forrester.  He's a good man.
Well, there's some fellows fishing at Pine Summit might be interested.  They probably saw it come down.  I'll let 'em know...What's it look like?
We sell the tamales, enchiladas - hot dogs!
He's very excited about it.
He's not showing it until it's down.  But it sounds hot, and we wanted to get all our stars lined up in case it is.  You and Robert got great ratings today. Which is the first thing we needed to know.
What?
I don't know.  A couple months.  Why?
No biggie, really.
Five earthquakes in three weeks is enough.
Maybe you should tell me your dream.
I should survive two days in Palmdale supplying soap bubbles for a detergent commercial, don't you think?
48 hours.  Back before you know it.
Like what?
Rex?  Who's Rex?
Say how they find their way back home.
You've got to sleep, Dylan, you...
Coming for you...
Just because it's a love story doesn't mean it can't have a decapitation or two.
Holding my own.  You know that guy who was calling me all the time?  He's started again.  He's been putting stuff in my mail.
Yeah...how'd you know?
When it is denial.  I don't think that's the case here, but if you're really worried, have a doctor check him out. You'll see, everything's fine.
Yes?
Yes.
Hi.  This is Heather Langenkamp.
Big truck went right by before you opened the door.  Life on the Fault Line.
Exactly.  The problem comes when the story dies. It happens a lot of different ways, the story gets too familiar, or too watered down by people trying to make it easier to sell, or ti's labeled a threat to society and just plain banned.  However it happens, when the story dies, the evil is set free.
Heather, it's just a movie, a dream, really...
Coffee'd be nice.
Your father?
I am about this.
He never would have believed a woman like you existed.
Yes, Sir.
Watch the tell-tales Chuck.  If we jibe now we'll have a lot of people in the water.
I didn't know sir.
No, I can't.
Whatever.
Well, Romeo here was on harbor watch and managed to sweet talk one of the local girls to have a go in the bowsprit.
What do you mean?
Listen, you don't cheat, and we'll make sure you get the grades.  We'll start a private study group.  Nobody knows.  You'll ace that test.
Believe what?
Yeah.  How'd you do.
Congratulations.
Yes you could.  You did.  This is all you.  Nobody else.
I was just thinking that I never had a new pair of shoes till I was twelve.
It's not a vacation, it's private school.
Nobody says you have to be like me.
You don't give him enough credit Chas.
Like this!
I guess.
They don't know that.  We were the only one's on deck. Look, there's nothing they can do to me right?  I'm a kid.
Maybe it's an air raid.
Fine.
How do you know?  They might.
Swear to God.  Only good advice he ever gave me.  Now, go back to sleep.
Jesus, you never told them?
The fact is... We'd like you to give Phil another chance.
He killed the dolphin.
Your cannons made a compelling argument.
No.
I know.
He's a big boy.
Why are you here?
I can take care of myself.
Look, you put me on this boat in the first place.  I didn't want to come but I did.  Why do you have to embarrass me.  Why can't you just leave me alone?
You do?
We're short one long boat too.  Come on.
They're in a hurry to grow up.  They don't know about consequences or responsibility.  That's being sixteen too.  I promise you one thing...
Not a chance.  Remind them that according to the Geneva Convention, firing on a civilian vessel on the high sea is an act of war.
I can show you how to use a slide rule.
I couldn't do it.
Trust me donut.  I know.
I've seen 'em.  I've seen 'em.
You will if you wanna eat.  Right George?
Then he shouldn't have written such a long poem, Mr. Lawford.
Outer.
No.  Bring him on deck with the others.
What?
Sir.
The first thing is I don't like people talking when I'm talking so the two of you, shut up.
You already have.  Now go on.  Do it.
I don't know...
I can't.
Yes, I was.
Do you think this is funny?  Some kind of joke?  You lost six people out there.
How ya feelin', Artie? I heard you wasn't doin' too well recent.
I didn't hate me so much, I'd feel better wishin' you luck.
No, he's out changin' the oil in the car.
You used the toilet, now you can go - what I do around here ain't any of your business, that's for sure.
Get out.
Fuck me.
Thanks, Bobby, 'bout done.
Well... I mean like Lula bein' in a family way.
Panty hose. Work better'n stockin's. Pull one of the legs down over your face and let the other leg trail behind your head. You get the pistol.  Remember, soon as we get inside, you keep that bad boy up where those hicks can see it. Once they notice the Ithaca and the Smith, they'll know we ain't foolin' with 'em.
Told ya I would. You still riled?
Wish I'd fuckin' cut you up good.
Used to.
You say it's straight ahead a mile?
Set one up.
Muchas gracias.
We were. Now Mr. San Pedro Sula and I are on our way back to Utila, in the morning.
I'm sorry.
In many capacities.
Certainly not. We are here only briefly, in fact, until this evening, when we fly to Austin, Texas to visit a friend of mine who is an agent for the CIA.
Darlin', you ain't seein' Santos again, are ya?
Somethin' was upsettin' you bad last night, and you wanted to tell me and I figured you wanted to tell me so's I could help...
Yeah... The one that introduced Santos to you and Clyde.
How'll he know what we look like? He seen our photo?
And?
Wrong, baby. Your daddy never committed no murder. Musta been you didn't hear grandmama proper. He made some mistakes, is all. Your daddy ain't always been so lucky... We're almost at the depot, honey. Sit back a minute.
'Bout fifty thousand times. I got us a room at the Cape Fear, and guess what?... I hear Powermad's at "The Hurricane."
Hell, peanut, you stuck with me after I planted Bob Ray Lemon. A man can't ask for more than that.
Hell, why should the Datin' Game be different from real life? At least them boys is gonna get somethin' to eat.
She got me an abortion...
Well, like mama told me, Aunt Rootie, Dell's mama? She found cockroaches in Dell's underwear.
Maybe my mama cares for me just a little too much...
You up for that?
Those toenails dry yet? We got some dancin' to do.
Yeah, I had my first taste on that trip to Juarez. At that age you still got a lot of energy.
Maybe two, three months after Juarez. I was visitin' my cousin, Junior Train, in Savannah, and we were at some kid's house whose parents were out of town. A girl comes up to me that was real tall, taller than me.
What do you mean by necessary? She's prob'ly already called the cops, my parole officer, her p.i. boyfriend Johnnie Farragut.
Thank the Lord. Well, you ain't let me down yet, Sailor. That's more'n I can say for the rest of the world?
What kinda trash talk is that?
Come look at this.
There ain't no water in the swimmin' pool. Just a dead tree fell in, prob'ly from bein' struck by lightnin'.
Yeah, it's a real problem for me, Sailor, you know? When I went in that drugstore by the restaurant in Biloxi? I saw 'em by the register and the girl throw 'em in. I'm not big on resistin'. So what about a leech?
I was hopin' you would. I know that night by heart. Sometimes, honey? I think it's the best night of my life.
Oh, baby, what an idea. I'd always be happy to see you, no matter what.
Where?
Uh huh.
I want to call her and tell her I'm okay. That we're okay.
That'd be good, Lula.
I can't take no more of this radio...  I ain't never heard so much concentrated weirdness in my life, Sailor Ripley, you find me some dancin' music right this minute... I MEAN IT!!
Not exactly, sugar... One reason we're in all the trouble we're in right now is cause of what I was doin'... I tried to tell you this before...
Yes I did... I sure did... The bad side of it is I did some drivin' for a man named Marcello Santos...
I know, sugar... But while the place was burnin'... Before Santos came out - I pitched some rocks at the second floor windows case anyone was upstairs sleepin'... Afterwards... When I met you, I always liked to think I mighta saved your life.
I take that as a sign that we were destined by fate to be together.
Let's get outta here, honey.
Not quite as bad as the weather though... It must be a hundred and ten and it ain't even noon yet.
Okay, honey, I'll see you later.
The only one.
You sick?
Love you, too.
I know this ain't easy, Lula, but I ain't gonna let things get no worse, I promise.
What could I be up to, Lula?
I killed Bob Ray Lemon, didn't I?
Lula, he mighta did, I don't know. But it don't matter now. Lotta guys go outta control in a war and it ain't their fault.
Thanks, darlin', I know you got my best interest in mind, and I 'preciate it sincerely. I love you, but I gotta sleep now.
Shake hands with your daddy.
Lead the way.
Why, how could I not worry? Not knowin' what's happenin' to you or where you are? Are you with that boy?
Argentina! Lula, you're outta your mind. Now you just tell me where you are and I'll come for you. I won't say nothin' to the police about Sailor, I promise. He can do what he wants, I don't care.
I am all right, mama. That's why I called, to let you know. I gotta go.
Don't be crazy, mama. Take care of yourself.
Got any plans?
What if I asked you not to?
I don't understand this... I don't understand this one bit. He was supposed to meet me right her in this lobby. Somethin' bad has happened - I jus know it.
That's not why I called.
I want you to take care of Sailor, so he won't ever be able to bother my baby again.
All right... I want you... to... kill... Sailor... As simple as that.
Yes.
Yes.
See! I knew you had it all under control.
Maybe I did... Try New Orleans first... Lula can't ever stop talkin' 'bout that town.
No...
Hey... Stop the nervous cry-baby routine... You're my girl now... Santos is gonna wipe away those tears and make you happy... Come on, let's get outta here.
There's no way in hell you can speak to her and...
It's a prob'lm I don't think's gonna go away too soon though... Peanut, I'm thinkin' of breakin' parole and takin' you out to sunny California.
We're going to the men's room. Only we might not make it in time.
Hhhuh. So we decoy her. Stick a couple pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she won't know the difference.
He's right, you look horrible.
Ah, right. Well, I gave you my opinion.
Come on. Crabs. Don't do this. He's one of my students, for Christ sake. I'm not even sure if he's --
Because... because...
Tripp.
Gee, I don't know, Crabs. I don't seem to remember you actually asking me if you could invite 200 people over to trash my living room.
Nothing, he's just been sort of, I don't know... kidnapped.
Good idea, Crabs. Only one problem. I don't know where they live.
It's a little late to call Admissions.
Only in your bones?
First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her car.
Only now I'm starting to think the car wasn't exactly Jerry's to give.
Call it a hunch.
Do you know he won't expel him?
Hey, Jeff. If you're really interested in discussing that business with the tango, try the guy at the end of the hall.
You did.
So I hear. You've also been smoking a lot of marijuana, I understand.
How long have you been smoking marijuana?
That's probably not the problem, then. What about your lifestyle. Any major changes recently?
They're anxiety attacks? That's a little disappointing.
So is my friend... is Sara still here?
Bullshit. I know a gun when I see one. And that's a gun.
As long as it looks like her, I don't care. You know what I'm saying?
No sweat. Only do me a favor?
No. Sara, you don't understand...
Yea?
They really hated it. I think they hated it more than any of the other ones.
I have trouble sleeping. While I'm lying in bed I figure them out. The stories.
I guess. Walter never tells Sara the truth about how much he pays for these things.
Maybe. I'm feeling a little sad myself tonight.
Yea, James.
Does she want to hear it was one of her professors?
Is he all right?
I thought you might -- I don't know -- swallow your tongue or something.  I guess you really miss her, huh?
What'd he say?
Good, James. If the Zodiac killer calls, be sure to mention the back door pops open with a couple hard shakes to the right.
Nothing, it's just that, well, it's been awhile since Arsonist's Daughter, and some people -- some of the kids in workshop -- thought maybe you were...
Blocked.
Your father worked in a mannequin factory?
Didn't you say your Mom went to Catholic school?
That's right. That one.
Jealous? Of me?
I never said that.
Who cares what I said last night, James I -- I was drunk, I was stoned. I'd been bitten by a dog. My wife had left me. How 'bout cutting me some slack?
In a minute. Get us a table.
Spells? Jesus, James, you make it sound like we're in a Tennessee Williams play. I don't have spells.
When nobody's looking.
Six. Their plane went down right outside Scranton.
I'm sorry about all that. I just -- I don't like to talk about my family. They treat me like a freak.  She makes me sleep in the basement of my own house. It's mine. My parents left it to me.
James'll know about George Sanders.
I thank you.
I hope that isn't true. We need all the downy innocents we can get.
Do?
I would if I knew where I was taking him.
James is odd. I know he has an aunt in Sewickley Heights. I dropped him there once, but...  Come to think of it, it wasn't even his Aunt's house. He said she worked there. Or something. I don't remember.
The one in your office? It's the best one for naps.
He shot the Chancellor's dog, didn't he? The blind one.
At first the police thought he just ran away, but this afternoon Dr. Gaskell found some blood spots on the carpet --
Crabtree said it sounded like something James would be messed up in.
Who does?
I told you, Sewickly Heights.
I'm sorry. It's these goddamned shoes. I don't know how anyone actually walks in these things.
Walter just got it back from the framer today.
All right. This morning --
She's left before...
If she's not now, Terry will make sure she is by the end of the evening.
Yes.
No you don't. And fuck you for saying you do. And fuck you for "saying...  ...for saying there's just no way. Because there could be a way, Grady.
Really? That was fast.
Inside.
Over there. In the backseat of the...
I think I might've said I was in love with you.
Terry told me about Wonder Boys. Is it true? Did you lose it all?
In the hospital. I was kind of excited about it at the time, but then I was on pretty heavy painkillers.
James is... I don't know...
That sounds like a fancy excuse for being a shit.
It's a bathtub. What she's standing under.
This is important.
I'm in love with your wife.
Oh... yeah.
Christ, Traxler. How the hell should I know?
Sick.
As a heart attack.
Oh, I don't think there's any danger of you aging prematurely, Grady.
I don't know if she'd want me to tell you that, Grady.
Why did you come here, Grady?
I might have his number on campus.
You want to keep him happy.
Seems like the whole world's gotten younger.
No shit.
She's got all this new furniture now. She said it didn't fit anymore, so I kept it in the attic. I thought you might like it.
Fucking Tigers. They got no pitching except for a bunch of green kids straight out of Double A or Southern Cal.  How was the party?
What's that?
When?
Tell Annette I'm busy in July.
You should see my appointment book. It got crazy.
Maybe I'm not a good man. Maybe inside I'm bad, and I'll always be bad.
You don't have to tell me this.
Carlos, I never raped a woman.
Maybe because you're looking her in the face.
Birds.
It's my bird book.
You can't talk to me like --
They grow outside, don't they?
Yes.
What?
Know what?
No.
I could take you downtown.
I have a passionate girlfriend.
Yes.
What?
Birds are my friends. That sounds egotistical, but they are. Birds know I watch them, but they don't mind because they like being watched... if they know you won't hurt them.
I know because... it's just something I know.
The job's okay.
Diaries have sent too many guys to prison.
Of course.
Reflect.
I'm still thinking about it.
Honest? No.
Honest? Your cheery personality makes my skin itch.
Rosen? I don't have a problem with that.
I don't feel anything.
I'm not that crazy.
You know why. It's part of the parole deal.
Then go see a therapist who will tell you you're normal!
You mean my problem?
I'm relaxed.
I don't see --
I see my sister.
In my bed, Rosen. Where do you think?
In my bed too.
Did you and your sister often take naps together?
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have been there.
Nothing.
That's all. I just liked smelling her hair.
What picture?
Most women wouldn't choose it.
I thought you were a dyke.
K through sixth.
What about them?
Yeah, they could.
What?
You're still here.
What for?
Hi.
Twelve years in prison?
Hey, I'm not --
You don't really --
Nothing. It's over.
I know.
What?
I'm not scared.
Fine.
Everyone needs a plant. This ivy is one tough baby. It's a cutting from one of mine.
Nothing.
Not when they fly.
Well, you know Lindsey, too damn aggressive-- Son of a--!!
I don't know.  Divorce ain't final.  Forgot to take it off.
His mixture got screwed up.  He panicked and pranged his regulator.
I saw something!  I'm not going to go back there and say I didn't see it when I did.  I'm sorry.
Look, the guy's operating on his own, cut off from chain of command.  He's exhibiting symptoms of pressure-induced psychosis.  And he's got a nuclear weapon.  So, as a personal favor to me... will you put your tongue in neutral for a while?
Yeah.  So sue me.
Wonderful.  There's some light from somewhere...
Calm down, Bud.
Check.  Then I just hang with these guys, right?
Hippy, you think everything's a conspiracy.
That's it then.  Finler, McWhirter, Dietz, and Perry.  Jesus.
Yeah, for now.  Our first priority's to get something to breathe.
Got it. Over.
It's his mixture!  Too much oxygen!
You watch yourself.
Happy as hogs in a waller down there, prob'ly.
Now we get to hear about how he used to be a contender.
Just checking is out, huh?  How come?
Just hold your water, okay?  So Kirkhill, we gonna do this or we gonna talk about it?
What's you depth, Cab Three?
I gotta tell you, that guy scares me a lot more than whatever's down there.  A.J. Squared Away goddamn jarhead robot.  Okay, gimme a couple hours on this.
That guy's crazier'n a shithouse rat!
Check this out.
Perry, stand by on the ROV.  Sorry about this, little buddy.  Better you than me, know what I mean?
She'll wait.
I don't know... It depends on Ettore... He's now in the process of negotiating for a contract here in Sicily...
What could be more restful than this?...  Excuse me, what is it that you want to try?
But why rattle your brains by arguing and talking... Believe me, Anna, words never help at all. They only serve to confuse. I love you, Anna. Isn't I that enough?
To the fact of my retirement, not only as a diplomat but also as a father.
Without any doubt, sir. If anything belonging to the girl who has run away is still here on this island...
I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to put it that way. But, you must understand, sir, that I...
Look... I'd like to get back to Lisca Bianca.
But even here we were supposed to find who knows what... And all we bring back with us is a crate of cigarettes.
Then why don't we go up and see the ruins?
But Anna wouldn't be staying with the kind of people who live here.
How should I be ... arrogant?
And why haven't they left each other?
Could be. They're the kind of people who are capable of anything.
No.
Yes.
I'm sorry. I didn't want to sound cynical. But isn't it better to look things squarely in the eye?
Who knows why they all left...
Oh no... It doesn't please me at all...
Because what I'm doing is so ugly ... Because if you told me right now: "Claudia, I love you," I would believe you...
Yes, she started to but I didn't feel like staying to listen to what she had to say. If we had to listen to everybody...
Good night. Tell me that you love me.
Better dead.
I would say he's pretty depraved.
One would have to be in love with somebody to know that.
To do what?
Quieter? Oh, yes, of course.
You shouldn't always take me seriously. Actually, I'm used to it by now. First my mother and now my husband; both of them are like dynamos.
What do you mean by sensible?
I think all you have to do, Giulia, is to close the door.
Do you know why? Because if you saw those ruins I'm sure you would have said they were very, very beautiful. You always say "how beautiful" to everything -- whether it's the sea, or a baby, or a cat! You have such a sensitive little heart that it throbs for anything.
Please, Giulia; must you always emphasize the obvious? I can see for myself that the weather is changing.
We'll try again.
Here I am.
From Panarea. Why?
What do you want us to do? I don't know myself... But we'll do something.
Yes, even I had a mother. She was part Austrian, but she was still my mother. My childhood was like a tennis match; they bounced me back and forth, here and there...
Is that far from here?
Yes... of course... But you should also print that in your paper... But right away, tomorrow morning... It's the local Palermo paper, isn't it?... I mean, it's widely read...
Oh, for Heaven's sake.
He loves you the way you are.
Who told you this?
Who tells you these things?
Oh my dear child.
Nonsense, I'm your mother now and I want you to eat.
You've got to eat something Agnes.
Yes, of God.
No.
It's not that... it's not that...
It's not my time of month.
Hasn't anyone ever told you that before?
Love.
Yes.
Right now?
Oh, there are so many.
In the confessional.
Where?
Would you like to ask them?
Not at the moment, no.
No.
I get headaches. Mommy did too... oh, but she wasn't stupid. She knew things that nobody else knew.
A mistake...
I can't help it if I'm stupid.
I'm always bad.
I can't.
... take off my clothes and then... she makes fun of me.
Yes.
Her headaches.
No I'm not.
No I'm not.
To help me.
Because I'm in trouble.
But it's easy. It's just a breath with sound. Say it. What kind of trouble?
It came out of me.
I can't tell you that.
I ate.
Fish...  ... brussel sprouts.
What else?
Are you ill?
What do you feel?
Who?
Of course you do. Who was it?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
She... left me alone with that little thing, and I looked at it, and I thought this is a mistake. But it's my mistake, not Mommy's. God's mistake.
I tied the cord around her neck... wrapped her in the bloody sheets... and stuffed her in the trash can.
Martha, all we're saying is, no-one wants this to come to trial, not the Church, not the Crown... least of all me.
Thanks...
Marty, what are you doing here?
You got to be crazy.
What's the matter with you, you've seen the reports. It's a cut and dried case.
You're too involved Marty.  Jesus look at you. Why don't you turn this case over to someone else?
If I find anything I'll call you.
I can get you new evidence next week.
Tomorrow... tomorrow, I'll get it by tomorrow. I will.
Who are you?
I remember when you was a little girl Marie. You come back from the movies and you'd say - Mama that ending was so sad... and I'd tell you they had all the happy endings locked away in a vault in Hollywood.  And you believed me.
Well that's a lot of land. You must have help. Do you have field hands that help you?
Sister Anne, which was Agnes' room?
Your mother was a resident of Saint Catherines home before you moved her.
I don't understand. Are you expecting me to..?
Yes... I...
Father Martineau, but I don't see him as a candidate.
Why do you think that?
That's ridiculous...
That she was unconscious, yes!  So someone easily could have come in the room and killed the...
That possibility never occurred to you?
Well, it's been known to happen in the day too. Maybe Agnes went to him.
I saw it. Clean through the palm of her hand. Do you think hysteria could do that?
How dare you tell me to run my affairs!
... or bullied or what ever you're doing. Who the hell do you think you are?  You go around here expecting applause for the way you treated this child.
There's another choice.
Nothing.
The twenty third of January. On that night one of our elder nuns passed away.
I don't think I care to know.
Oh God, if only I'd known.
She's happy with us and she could go on being happy if she was left alone.
Bullshit!
You just said...
Yes I do.
Would it stop you if I did?
Of course.
You're what?
One that will ask the questions you want asked.
She is an innocent.
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
I wanted her to have it when no-one else was around, they would have taken the baby to a hospital and left it with them, but it was such a difficult birth, there was so much blood and I panicked.
Then she's a liar.
Wasn't it!
Yes, they were playing the queues outside the picture palaces of Liverpool. Scruffy young lads, lacking even the price of a jam roll. Orphans, every Paddy's son of 'em. I saw their potential at once although I had me doubts about the little fella, a savage primitive, that Ringo, but it was him what gave in first. He picked up a brick and heaved it at me and I quelled him wid one fierce flash of me eyes. "Mister, can you spare us a copper?" he said. I was disarmed by the grubby little outstretched mauler ... So, I took them under me managerial banner.
Oh, not at all, I let them have twenty-five; sure aren't there four of them?
They are?
Well! A boy of your age bowling <U>"hoop"</U> at people. How old are you anyway?
Well that's lovely talk, that is. And another thing, why aren't you at school?
Just you?
Yeah? And they're your mates are they?
What they like?
I'm a deserter, too.
I'll murder that Lennon.
Aren't you supposed to be in that box?
Aren't you being rather arbitrary?
Spoil sport!
Well, that's the wrong line for a start.
Ah ... a shamus, eh?
Bag-snatcher.
You do - repeatedly.
No. I don't.
But I won't.
Have I said something amiss?
You crawler.
We do.
Sorry.
If I let you have your own way, you little rascal, will you respect me?
I'll look in here again.
Well, it must be catching. He's given it to the champ here.
Is it ... is it, really?
No.  I'm a walk-on in a fancy dress scene. I just felt like doing those lines.
Aye well, actresses aren't like real people, are they?
I'm in a group ... well ... there are four of us, we play and sing.
Quite right, invites to gambling dens full of easy money and fast women, chicken sandwiches and cornets of caviar, disgusting!
Out where?
Yeah ... that's right.
I'm not wrong.
What?
Have they?
Get Lloyd George over there with that mechanic in the cloth cap while I sort this lot out.
You see, sly villains.
We've just finished, Pauly. Hey George, write us your John Henry on this picture.
Oh, that one. That's me Grandfather.
Oh yeah, he's very clean, y'know.
Don't be callous.
Like what?
Please, can I have one to surge with?
Now, look here, Norm ...
No, not me.
Oh yes.
Well, yes your nose is. Very.
Is it? Is it really?
I knew I could rely on you.
Don't exaggerate.
Ah well, there you go. Look, I'm going down the diner for a cup of coffee, are you coming?
Sorry.
Good lad, Ringo.
I don't need you to defend me, y'know, Norm.
But...
Oh, all right. Come here, Grandad.
It's not my fault.
Well, give a couple of minutes ...
Shurrup, cheerful.
I've got a little list here. Wandering abroad. Malicious intent. Acting in a suspicious manner. Conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace. You name it, he's done it.
Is that you, Roby?
Hell, we're equipped --
Nine hundred meters and dropping. 800.  700.  Hang on gentlemen.
Or something will be able to see us.
Dell, plot our location.
Yeah.  Two hours.
Point eight six.  We can walk on it.
Receiving.
Looks like a derelict.
No, you'll follow me.
Chaz, this is Dell.  Can you come topside for a minute?
Well, the sun just came up again, and it seems the wind's died down. It's as clear as a bell outside. There's something I think you ought to see.
Don't remember nothing.  Can't hardly remember my name.
I have a temporary sequence on the monitor --
Right.  Talk to you.
It couldn't translate the whole thing, only three phrases.  I'll just read it to you the way I got it:  "... HOSTILE... SURVIVAL... ADVISE DO NOT LAND... "  And that's all it could translate.
Shit...
We have to avoid injuring it.  What we really need is some electric animal prods.
Dead.
The water will still recycle.
Oh -- I'm not near ready yet.
Just hold us together till we're in space, that's all!
Meet us on the bridge.  Be careful -- it's <u>huge</u> now.
It's eating a hole in the floor!
You can't tell -- that kind of stuff could represent printed circuits...
We'd be sitting ducks in the freezers.
How could anything be indigenous to this asteroid?  It's dead.
That's right -- we can't kill it on the ship, but we can at least keep it at bay -- and maybe drive it into the air lock.
We can't spare the personnel.  We've got minimum takeoff capability right now.  That's why Chaz left us on board.
I think it's fizzled out.
The same thing must've happened to the creatures on the other ship... except they took one of those jars on board, and opened it there.
Listen, hadn't somebody better check on Broussard?
In symbolic form... very stylized... but if you stare at it, you can see some of the different creatures we've been dealing with.
You will notice, though, that there are no more phases.  Only four forms are shown.  After that the pattern repeats.
I should hope so!  And we'd better make sure it's pretty far from the ship when we blow it.
Thanks for the thought.
Sandy, can you home in on that beam?
Sorry.  Nothing but that same damn transmission, every 32 seconds.  I've tried every frequency on the spectrum.
Who knows?
I couldn't make it out -- too much interference.
We'll have to trap it somehow.  If we had a really strong piece of net, we could bag it.
Are they close?
And you and I will bag it, and then we'll take it to the ventral air lock, got it?
Nontoxic... but unbreathable. Pressure?
Oh well... you know me.
We're coming up now, open the outer lock door.
It's some kind of organism, it's attached itself to him.  Let us in.
Good.
Up one kilometer, Jay.
Food-storage room!
Well... yes... there's a pattern... but it's meaningless to me.
Doesn't matter -- we're already at light speed.  And when we get back to the Colonies, they'll pick us up in the network.
Now.  If we can get it into the boat, we won't have to blow it up -- we can just eject it into space.
What did it do to you?
Yeah...
Wait a minute.
Thanks.
A three-second burn to port, on my mark.
Sounds like a couple of escape shuttles.
Nooooo!
Has anybody talked to them?
Alright, let's keep calm.  We've got to have an option of some sort... there's got to be a way out of this.
Hey!  I was in shape before we started doing this.
Goldsmith's gonna be plenty pissed at losing one of her babies.
C'mon De Vries.  Think of the bonus.
Hey, fair enough.  If you won't come, I'll handle it myself.
What?
It's moving slow.  About... eleven metres. On the left.
Where does that lead to?
Uh-huh.
What's the problem?
And, nothing.  They checked out just fine.
How many... how many people are missing?
Forget it.  I wouldn't ask somebody to do something I wouldn't do myself.  Where's the disk?
Let's just run through it one more time so I know you've got it straight.
Right.  When you've done that, don't waste any time getting out of there.  Once that crane starts moving...well, it's bound to provoke some kind of response.
Check out the tent.
Hold on...
Detour.  Other way's blocked...
I... I can't!
Camped out by the navi-beacon out on Linson's Range.  They're making their own way back tomorrow.
Give me a yell is something happens.
Certainly, Mr. deWitt...
You're more than kind. But it's still Miss Channing's performance. I'm just a carbon copy you read when you can't find the original...
Please do.
I'd love to! Or should I pretend I'm busy?
Yes. I do.
Just some coffee.
Just like that.
Almost four.
She's always been so fantastically devoted to Lloyd. I would imagine that only death or destruction could keep her-
You have no right to say such things!
More plainly and more distinctly? I Have not come to New Haven to see the play, discuss your dreams, or to pull the ivy from the walls of Yale! I have come to tell you that you will not marry Lloyd - or anyone else - because I will not permit it.
So does the history of the world for the past twenty years. I don't enjoy putting it as bluntly as this, frankly I had hoped that you would, somehow, have known - have taken it for granted that you and I...
She did like you, she helped and trusted you! You paid her back by trying to take Bill away!
Why not?
It's the same thing, isn't it?
That's how you met me. In passing.
Why do they always look like unhappy rabbits?
And too many of them are produced.
Hear, hear...
You were there? At the play - last night?
Dear Margo. You were an unforgettable Peter Pan - you must play it again, soon. You remember Miss Caswell?
I take it she read well.
How nice.
Everything... everything's so funny...
Show me a human and I might have!
Real diamonds in a wig. The world we live in...
Like a nylon lemon peel-
Did she tell you about the Theater and what it meant?
I'll try.
Everybody can't be Gregory Peck.
Sing it?
It won't play.
To put me to bed? Take my clothes off, hold my head, tuck me in, turn off the lights, tiptoe out...? eve would. Wouldn't you, Eve?
You've heard it. About when I looked through the wrong end of a camera finder.
Nothing, really...
Eve?  How enchanting...  Wherever did you get the idea of having Eve read with Miss Caswell?
You wouldn't understand.  How was Miss Caswell?
So full of meaning, fire and music!
Don't mix your metaphors.
I'm trying terribly hard.
That word again! I don't even know what it means...
Come on, get up. I'll buy you a drink.
Margo, let's make peace.
I'll marry you if it turns out you have no blood at all.
What would you like? Texas?
You know what I'm going to be?
A married lady.
I just wondered.
It means concentration of ambition, desire, and sacrifice such as no other profession demands... And I'll agree that the man or woman who accepts those terms can't be ordinary, can't be - just someone. To give so much for almost always so little...
You're quite a girl.
But she just got here...
They can always grab oranges off trees. This you can't do in Times Square...
Oh, brother.
Imagine. All this admiration in just one room.
Something maybe grew a size bigger.
Like an agent with one client.
My back's open.  Did the extra help get here?
You're not being funny, I could get actors for less. What about the food?
That French ventriloquist taught you a lot, didn't he?
I - I guess I fell asleep.
You were just looking around...
I've heard of them.
You rest. I'll get it...
Why should you think I wouldn't be?
I hope you don't mind my speaking to you...
Oh, no...
But if I'd known... maybe some other time... I mean, looking like this.
My husband...
I'll be at the old stand, tomorrow matinee-
Karen.
Do you think Miss Channing would approve?
But Mr. Richards and Mr. Sampson-
There can't be very much-
- and easy or not, I won't believe a word.
Do you expect me to believe that you didn't say any of those things - that they were all Addison?
Some vague promises of a test, that's all - if a particular part should come along, one of those things-
- an understudy's performance.
I'll never get over it.
If you told him so, he'd give me the part. He said he would.
Of course it is.
Yes, it is! You're talented, famous, wealthy - people waiting around night after night just to see you, even in the wind and rain...
You've what?
Please don't play governess, Karen, I haven't your unyielding good taste, I wish I'd gone to Radcliffe too but father wouldn't hear of it - he needed help at the notions counter...  I'm being rude now, aren't I? OR should I say "ain't I"?
Be brave. He'll come back - with or without gas.
It doesn't matter.
Bill's in love with Margo Channing. He's fought with her, worked with her, loved her... but ten years from now - Margo Channing will have ceased to exist. And what's left will be... what?
Isn't that what they always say?
About what?
With tears.
It's about time we did! It's about time Margo realized that what's attractive on stage need not necessarily be attractive off.
Up to here! That's where I've got it - up to here! Of all the star ridden, presumptuous, hysterical-
And again and again! Two hours late for the audition, to begin with-
Of course she knew! For one thing, Addison told her how superbly Eve had read the part-!  Karen, let me tell you about Eve. She's got everything - a born actress. Sensitive, understanding, young, exciting, vibrant-
What is?
Five-fifty-five. We'll be at the station in plenty of time...
I wonder why.
Now just a minute!
Margo!
What are you going to wear?
I have no possible interest in anything she'd have to say.
Nothing...
And you pose as a playwright. A situation pregnant with possibilities - and all you can think of is everybody to go to sleep...
Not exactly. Sometimes, though, I wish I understood you better.
I will.
It seems almost inconceivable that I haven't seen her backstage, but with so many people loitering around... well, well. So Eve is not working for Max after all-  - Max you sly puss.
She was a revelation...
That's beside the point.
- in this case, apparently, as trustworthy as the World Almanac!
Not mouse, never mouse! If anything - rat!
Perfectly innocent! Man have been hanged for less! I'm lied to, attacked behind my back, accused of reading your silly dialogue inaccurately - as if it were Holy Gospel!
Look, Miss Channing... it's kind of depressing. If you don't mind my saying so, everybody's kind of dying on the vine...
How about me what?
Poor Max. Heartburn?  It's that Miss Caswell. I don't know why she doesn't give Addison heartburn.
I feel right now like there's one burning in me.
--Hunt doesn't seem like your ordinary consultant.
I met a Presidential aide once at a social occasion.
--see?--
For the paper, no; for us, plenty.  I waited a long time and finally this big guy--I guess a bodyguard-- he left and I knocked and she remembered me, we talked awhile.
--she was panicked, Carl--every time I mentioned Watergate, you could tell.
Alphabetically, on the CREEP phone list, Miss Helen Abbott of South George Street.
You're not a kid anymore.
And I'm a Republican.
Sure.
Nixon.
--we will--
You mean, who's going to play the mean M.P. and who's going to be the nice one?  Whichever.
--Colson.
--shit, who do we know?--
--has he got an ax?--
The burglary was done by Cubans or Democrats or Republicans.
You asking would I have been one of the President's men?  I would have been.
It makes a crazy kind of sense-- remember that initiation rite they have at the White House? Each new member of the President's staff has to prove his guts by getting an enemy of Nixon.
What if I went up and introduced myself--think he'd slug me?
--he said John Haldeman, not Bob Haldeman--
John N. Mitchell, while serving as US Attorney General, personally controlled a secret cash fund that--
The telephone calls... we know about that.
Any idea what he did?
Chapin did contact you then?
--yes--
We've just been talking to Young--
--Deep Throat?--
--what?--
Absolutely--
Give me your checkbook then.
There's always a later plane.
This girlfriend of mine at the Committee, the other day she went back to the D.A. to tell the things the FBI didn't ask her. That night, her boss, he knew what she'd done. They control everything; that's how they know it all.
I'm relaxed--light your cigarette.
--it was all in hundreds, wasn't it?
Sloan knew which five, didn't he?
'Cause I'm not calling out from the phone company anymore--  --I think the place is bugged.
I will not talk about the other two.
--it's gotta be Haldeman--someone from the White House had to be involved--
--let me put it this way: I'd have no problem if you did.
--you double-checked both sources?--
My non-denial denial.
--his dialing finger must be falling off--
There is no reason to assume other people were involved.
...you're definitely doing a story...?
John Mitchell resigned as head of CREEP to spend more time with his family. That doesn't exactly have the ring of truth.  Howard Hunt's been found--there was talk that his lawyer had 25 thousand in cash in a paper bag.
This man Gordon Liddy--he's going to be tried along with Hunt and the five burglars--we know he knows a lot, we just don't know what.
Do Justice and the FBI know what we know, and why the hell haven't they done anything about it?
Haldeman too?
Nationwide--my God, they were frightened of Muskie and look who got destroyed--they wanted to run against McGovern, and look who they're running against. They bugged, they followed people, false press leaks, fake letters, they canceled Democratic campaign rallies, they investigated Democratic private lives, they planted spies, stole documents, on and on-- don't tell me you think this was all the work of little Don Segretti.
--you've done worse than let Haldeman slip away, you've got people feeling sorry for him--I didn't think that was possible. A conspiracy like this-- the rope has to tighten slowly around everyone's neck. You build from the outer edges and you go step by step. If you shoot too high and miss, then everybody feels more secure. You've put the investigation back months.
James McCord.
The C.I.A.
--this White House guy, a good one, a pro, came up and asked what is this Watergate compulsion with you guys and I said, well, we think it's important and he said, if it's so goddamn important, who the hell are Woodward and Bernstein?
--well, I've got some pretty experienced fellas sitting around, wouldn't you say so?--
That's everything Bachinski had, I think it's worth following up.
You can't believe that.
Could develop.
I don't get it--you were the one who wanted to fire him.
Maybe to fire you--since you two started on this story, the Post stock has dropped, what, 50 percent?  And the word is some Nixon people are challenging her TV licenses. I'm not saying she's going on relief, but I don't think it's unreasonable for her to want to meet you.
No. It was closer to seven hundred thousand.
Haldeman.  Right?
One thing I'm not completely clear on--when you gave out the money to Liddy, how did that work?
I'm not Miss Abbott.
Sorry.
Okay then.  The rest of you okay with that?
Sorry, coach.
Suck me...beautiful?
...okay...
I'm so happy for you.  Takes the edge off, doesn't it?  And where might your date be?
You?  You think I don't get that? God, it's like just because I don't get drunk and barf every weekend, people say "Oh, here's this goody-two- shoes choir-girl priss."
Neither will I.
How did you know I was here?
Oh thank God, I thought I was the only one.
You can't sing at the competition.
No, that's not what I mean.  I mean -- look.  You know what made me leave that game?  Coach was giving this speech, about not slacking off when you see the opportunity to score.
No, see Heather, what I realized is that...with you, it's not like I'm running towards the goal, trying to figure out the best way to score.  And this may sound corny, but --
Sure.
Well of course I'd want to give her that.  I mean, what do you think, I don't care about her?
Well it's up to you.  The Big L, or the Big O.
Did you guys hook up or something?
Nothing, I just hugged her back.
Finch, you got the Latin homework?
But --
Pontificated.
Right.  That gives us...
Holy shit!
Dad, come in.
That's great.  Now remember, it's <u>okay</u> to play with yourself.  Or, as I always called it --  "Stroke the salami!"  Ho-ho, Jim.  There's nothing to be ashamed of.  Hell, I'm fifty-two, and I still enjoy masturbating.  Uncle Mort masturbates.  We <u>all</u> masturbate.
Oh, no, not too much of a bookworm. He's a good little kid.  Er, guy. Man.
Is it because we have a test tomorrow? Sometimes I get cranky when I know I have a big test to study for.
I thought so.  Because, one time?  I was at this --
Michelle.
It reminds me of this one time --  Hey, can I ask you a question?  How come you don't have any stories?  I've got lots of stories, and you don't have any.
I told you.
Oh!  And then this one time?  At band camp?  I stuck a flute in my pussy.
"Fun loving" -- insane.
Oh that's really reassuring.  And don't call me Nova anymore.  I'm a fraud.
Yeah, I think you sounded pretty good.
Perhaps you can help me with my studies?
Do you mind?  This fabric is so uncomfortable.
God dammit, Stifler!
This just got a hell of a lot better.
You think so?
I don't know.  How do you?
I want to hear you say it.
Don't say that, we can do it somehow. It might not be perfect, but --
I know.  Let's go.  Don't you have something to tell your friends?
Oh shit dude, the L-word!
This is different.  This is better. Think of when you're working out, Oz. You need a partner, someone to spot you.  Someone to keep you motivated.
Dude, prom sucks.
Attitude?  Me?  I think that <u>you</u> guys should be more enthusiastic.  Shit, we've been trying to get laid forever, and tonight's the night we've been waiting for.  We're in this together. Don't back out on me now!
I don't care.
Yeah.  So you want double condiments on that?
Depends if my date wants to stop by.
Dude, it's gotta happen -- she's a college chick!
This place is an untapped resource. Check it out, dude, these vocal jazz girls are <u>hot</u>.
I'll bet you do, you little horndog, she's givin' you fuckin' stiffies, right?
Uh huh.
No way.
Yeah. Apparently.
No it isn't! You're dead!
A-duh... You're a werewolf. And we, as your victims, have to walk the earth until your curse is lifted.
Yeah, that's the word. And you are?
It's a fucking nightmare, isn't it?
What?
Fine. My mistake. You know, I'm gonna be a writer myself some day.
Maybe I didn't know him like you did. But he's my uncle. And I owe it to him to get some answers. It's a quest like, uh, Hemingway, the Old Man and The Sea. Except instead of an old man I'm a young man, and instead of the sea, it's a bunch of tunnels under Paris. And instead of a big fish it's... who knows? That's what I'm going to find out. Au revoir.
So's Woody Allen.  No, your uncle really helped me. I was sort of messed up for a while. Wasting my time just partying and... just stupid shit. He kind of woke me up, gave me a job, got me taking classes.  You know, he and Claude, their work is controversial, but they're serious about it. Totally dedicated.
Ahh, Rodin. Mmm! He's the fuc-  I mean, he's the best. You must go to the Rodin sculpture garden, in the huitieme, it's so beautiful.
Shit. What have I done?  Stall them! I'll meet you out back.
Before Hemingway, there was Starsky and Hutch.
What was I? Your idea of a fuckin' hors d'oeuvre? Huh?
Where?
"Stop! Beyond this passage lie the catacombs of Paris: the exclusive domain of the dead."
Let's go from both ends. We'll cut him off.
You on drugs? Huh?
Shhh! Be quiet, man! We're not alone -
Hey, I'm new here, what do you want?
Sure. Don't you?
Why isn't it doing anything!?
Oh shit... No...
Oh no... no....
He's on a new drug called ZBH, or "Daydream". It allows the user to be fully alert and mobile while he's dreaming. He is literally conscious and unconscious at the same time.
Yeah?
Why the fuck would I do that?
It's chemistry, Andy. Nothing more. Mutated antigens concentrated in the heart of the infector unlock a vaccine- like chain reaction in the infectee. There were not many bio-chemists working in the twelfth century, but with today's technology it's possible to synthesize any chemical imaginable. When I discovered this ancient cure I knew who to go to.
Great, but listen, I need to know where you hid the ADM?
How well did, er, do you know him?
No. The doctors say the machines should keep him going a long time. But basically he is, how you say, a legume.
I can't believe this. Why don't you go down in the tunnels and find the goddamn... animals that attacked my uncle?
Just the name of this hospital, St. Severin. He repeated it a few times then he lost consciousness.
Allo?
Just a crazy call from a girl, probably fucked up on drugs. I wouldn't bother you but you said call with anything unusual.
Yes sir.
He says -
Your uncle was carrying this. The keys to his apartment are in there. I talked to his assistant, Madame Flocquet. You'll be staying there a while?
I know, but I had to because . . .
I'm not sure but look. . .
Well, I don't have any money . . .
She's quite right, Dmitri, a man of my stature should not have to
Look - there isn't an orphan in the world who doesn't dream she's a princess but, come on. . .  Look at me!
It's not you - it's the dress!
Well, the only thing you've got when you've got a home is a fear of losing it! You're lucky you don't remember the revolution -- I never had much, but what I did have -- I lost.
Tell me it isn't true?! Tell me you didn't do this for the money!
Anya... where are we?
I don't know! I don't want to hurt you...
No, it wasn't a bat! I saw this horrible man - I remember him, I think...
Oh, yes, Grandmama - I wait until I hear...
No, he just wanted to know you were happy.
You'll have to become used to it, child, if you accept the crown...
Is it? Is this what you want?
Yes, you do. You do.
No, I really like my tongue... we're very attached.  Oyyyy... Okay, now... promise you won't get angry.
Get to the point sometime tonight.. I'm late for a wenching.
How do you know?
Bartok... a question.
She leads a charmed life, that little one ... Someone is always there to save her. In the palace as a child, on the train and now ... it's him.
Yes. And I hate that in a woman.
What do you mean?
What I <U>found</U>your was your granddaughter!
And tell me that she's happy.
Oh, heavens - I must say, yes.
This guy's on television.
You don't want my autograph.
M'mm.
Well, you only give me books with the word "death" in the title.
Who are you?
It's okay.
Will you relax, please? They're gonna love you, I know.
Tsch.
You're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me.
No, I'm sorry, I can't do it. We- we've blown it already. I-you know, uh, I-I can't go in in the middle.
I don't know now. You-you wanna go to another movie?  So let's go see The Sorrow and the Pity.
Well, stop listening to him.
M'm, I don't know, sometimes I ask myself how I'd stand up under torture.
M'm.
I can't! I can't put him in the pot. I can't put a live thing in hot water.
Yeah. I'm gonna get my... I'm gonna get my camera.
Oh, well, let's see, there was Dennis, from Chippewa Falls High School.
Yeah, I-I think you're pretty lucky I came along.
Well, no... not just, not only.
You-you play... very well.
Me? Oh, downtown!
Oh, well, I'm goin' uptown, too.
Well, where is it? I-
Do I drive? Uh, no, I gotta-I gotta problem with driving.
Oh, really? Oh, well... uh, uh, maybe, uh, maybe, we, uh...
You know, I don't like to show my body to a man of my gender-
think that's, uh-
What?
Yeah.
Oh.
"There goes another novel."  Jesus, you were great.
Yeah.
Really. I mean it. I-I'll never play the piano again.
I tried to take my pants off over my head...  ...my ear.
You are extremely sexy.
That place is four hundred dollars a month?
Just don't take any course where they make you read Beowulf.
I don't know. You- It's like you're- you're removed.
Oh, stop it. But you were having an affair with your college professor. That jerk that teaches that incredible crap course "Contemporary Crisis in Western Man"!
We're not having an affair. He's married. He just happens to think I'm neat.
Who cares? Who cares?
M'm.
Me? I'm-I'm one of the few males who suffers from that, so, so... you know.
I whine. I-I-I sit and I whine.
Yeah?
Sinatra had gl- You never said Sinatra had glasses. So whatta you saying that I-I'm suffocating you?
There's a spider in the bathroom.
I know, I know, and a first-aid kit and a fire extinguisher.
I don't know.
That'd be fun for yuh. Don't you think-
What... huh?
Oh, yeah? What is this, anyway?  Let me see. Okay, let's... oooh, God!  Oh, you knew I wanted this...  God, it's terrific, God!
Thing?
Yeah, I know it's sick, but it's new. You know, you didn't say it couldn't be sick.
Really? And what is the kick of it? Because I never...
Nothing at all?
Well, let's see now... If it has my name on it, then I guess it's mine.
Yeah.
That's right, that's right.  You only gave me books with the word "death" in the titles.
I'm late.
Oh, yeah?  Terrific.
Step up here!
No jokes-these are friends, okay?
I'm too tense. I need a Valium. My analyst says I should live in the country and not in New York.
The only word for this is trans- plendid. It's trans-plendid.
He's God! I mean, this man is God! He's got millions of followers who would crawl all the way across the world just to touch the hem of his garment.
I'm a Rosicrucian myself.
Oh, tsch, thank you. H'm.
He's screaming his opinions in my ear.
Key word here is "indulgent."
It's the influence of television. Yeah, now Marshall McLuhan deals with it in terms of it being a-a high, uh, high intensity, you understand?  A hot medium... as opposed to a...
Pick up the license. You have to ask nicely 'cause I've had an extremely rough day. You know, my girl friend-
Alvy, you're a total paranoid.
Don't you see? The rest of the country looks upon New York like we're-we're left-wing Communist, Jewish, homosexual, pornographers. I think of us that way, sometimes, and I-I live here.
Sun is bad for yuh. Everything our parents said was good is bad. Sun, milk, red meat, college...
We can show her the schoolyard.
Yes, I remember.  He was all schoolyard. They threw him a football once, he tried to dribble it.
While you're out here, Max, I want you to see some of my TV show. And we're invited to a big Christmas party.
Great, but nobody laughs at it 'cause your jokes aren't funny.
Oh, Jesus.
You're an actor, Max. You should be doing Shakespeare in the Park.
She was stealing.
No.
You think so? Do you really?
Uh, we just wanted to stop by and say that we really enjoyed your sets.
No, I don't-I don't know, but I-I know your work. I'm a big fan of yours.
I don't know, this is strange to me, you know.
Yeah.
I was a great beauty.
I was very charming.
Oh, I was quite a lively dancer.
A triumph.  When did you get here?
Absolutely not.
Why last?
Oh, she's really enjoying it.  I think. Is Mac okay?
Leo?  It was out to Jude Law.  Jude passed.
Five years ago, I was at the party, remember?
Of course.
I'd say it was down.
Why would she care?
With a sitter.  We have a sensational sitter.  Jonah's really comfortable with her.  You know, a second mom sort of. Like part of the family.  Amazing with kids.
Dander.  He's allergic.  Otis.
He's not going tonight.
Damn straight.
Count on it.
I'm not so sure.  Look again in three months.
Lucy overdosed.
Forget it, Judy.
Oh yeah... I'm gonna save you.
A perfect night.
We've only been over this how many times?
Before I forget.  Put it on the bookshelf.
Just do what I say, alright?
Hardly...
You didn't kiss anyone else's knees, did you?
They can't find a sitter...  Hello?  Excuse me?  Yes, uh, hold on.  Just a moment.  It's Skye Davidson.  She needs directions to the house.  You invited Skye fucking Davidson to our anniversary party?
You invited her to our anniversary party? I didn't even invite my mother.
Really?
It's alright.  Be our guests.
It's ecstasy, Sal.
He'll find his way back.
Otis!!!!
Otis!
Sally, I have never considered you for this part because you are too old to play it.  And you are out of touch with reality if you think differently.
Okay.  If we could've, by some miracle, stripped ten years off your face, still couldn't have got the thing made. Because I don't mean anything as a director, and your name doesn't mean fuck all anymore.  And the people that can hire you are afraid to, because they think you're phoning it in.  That you don't have... Oh Christ, Sally.
Your director and your co-star of your current movie.  Don't dish if you can't take it, Sally.
Sally, for Christ's sake.
Don't push me away.
You changed your mind.
I wasn't part of that picture at all, was I?  I wasn't part of that decision.  Did I occur to you at all?  It's a fucking farce.  It's a fucking farce.  How long did you think you could keep it going. You're amazing.  Do you have any idea what you've done to us?
I'll never forgive you.
Okay.
Ah...
Is your script much like the novel? Jerry says it's very good.  But you know, you read the novel, and then you see the movie - and most of the time you say, "what's this?" You know?  I sometimes think we're better off not reading the novel at all.  Because, we come with expectations... and of course, we know where we're going.  Don't you find?
Yes I know.  I started to say... I started to say Joe that --
Ah there's our snookums now.
What?  Oh yeah, the camera man?  They gave me a list.
Uh-huh.
Oh.
Hm.
And your phone calls are nasty and abusive.  And I've come this close to suing you for harassment.  And you're only here because we're supposed to be sucking up to you.
We're way past inappropriate.
Lemon.
I'm sorry.
That's a lot of those.
Yeah, it was.  For a writer nothing's sacred.  No, nothing at all.
Oh, I love that.  I'm just great.  I'm so happy to be here. And I apologize for invading you.  And I'm so happy you asked me to.  I'm so touched.  I know how private you and Sally are.
This is an amazing present.  What a sweetheart you are.
Time!
Well...wow...
I'm not going to leave you alone.
There's only you, Ryan.  You know what, Ryan?  You're beautiful.  I love you so much... You need...
Let's just go home, okay?
Sally?
Oh?
Are you asking me to marry you?
Very.
Oh great.
Oh, okay, forgive me.  Your neighbors are here, for fuck's sake.
"How are you really doing, Panes?" "Lousy, thank you, I'm falling apart."
No.  No, not like the last time.  She was the rest of my life.
Nothing's wrong.  It's great, okay? Having the time of my life.  Mac's a fantastic director.  And what can anyone say about Cal that hasn't been said.  And it's great working with friends, blah blah blah.
From Jewish Folk Poetry, a song cycle...
It's just very distracting when you're trying to work.
I'll be right out.
I don't mind...
Would you like to meet my husband?
She took our wedding photos, for chrissakes.  You don't trust anyone.
Well, are you sure about this baby thing? It's not the ticking clock shit, is it?
He wants playmates.  Oh he's a sweetheart, Sal, you know I love him. But he's not going to be a good father. He's just not parenting material.
This colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground.  Why are we even digging this thing?
Z?  <u>Our</u> Z?  The little guy made it!
Right...because every ant's important!
Well...  I declared war!
<u>What</u>?
You -- you think I'm right?
No...as a matter of fact...
I CAN'T DANCE WITH A WORKER!
How should <u>I know</u>?
Climb up that tree and get a better view!
Who's the bigger idiot -- the idiot who gets kidnapped, or the idiot who lets herself get kidnapped by the idiot?
Yeah, well I have it on a reliable source...  that it exists.  Now you follow the yellow egg...  <u>That</u> direction.
Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap.
Hlllllllp!
Five thousand three hundred and ninety -- no.  About five thousand four hundred by now.
Come on...tell me there wasn't just a little...something between us that first night at the bar.  The night we danced.
Yes?
Forget it.  You go ahead, I give up. I...I don't know what I was thinking. "Insectopia".
I wonder...what...was it all...for...
Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?
Scattered reports, sir.  Rumors. Nothing reliable.
I...I have no idea, sir.
Oh, of course --
Look, General!  A darling baby soldier!  Don't try to be a hero!  Just make sure you come back in one piece!  Next!
YES!!!  You know, people ask me, "Doctor, why are you always happy?" And I tell them it's mind over matter.  I don't <u>mind</u> that I don't <u>matter</u>!  Do you get it?  Do you get it?
Why are we so successful?
Will you introduce me to some worker girls?
You're a real buddy.
Big shot! For you, I wouldn't lift a finger -- but for her, I'll fix a little something to eat.
Yes, Mrs. Dreyfuss. He starts out with a worried backward glance toward the two. Fran is just sitting there, the spoon in her hand, not touching the soup.
Sheldrake?
Really?  I was looking at some figures from the Sickness and Accident Claims Division -- do you know that the average New Yorker between the ages of twenty and fifty has two and a half colds a year?
I should have stayed in bed last night.
Really?
Meet you in the lobby. Okay?
You shouldn't.
Don't be too sure. Just because I wear a uniform -- that doesn't make me a Girl Scout.
I shouldn't drink when I'm driving.
Nothing.  There are just too many people here.
This is a bad day for me.
Why?
The mirror -- it's broken.
Oh.  Yes?  Just a minute.  If you don't mind -- this is sort of personal
Oh, yes -- office party -- Miss Olsen --
Let me help you.
I just want to go brush my teeth --
Well, I haven't figured it out, exactly.
He doesn't give a damn about me.
Oh, I don't mind. As a matter of fact, I'm sort of flattered -- that anybody should think a girl like you -- would do a thing like this -- over a guy like me.
You don't have to entertain me.
Pick a card.
Three. The last one was manager of a finance company, back home in Pittsburgh -- they found a little shortage in his accounts, but he asked me to wait for him -- he'll be out in 1965.
Oh. I can type up a storm, but I can't spell. So they gave me a pair of white gloves and stuck me in an elevator -- that's how I met Jeff --  Oh, God, I'm so fouled up. What am I going to do now?
I'm going to write a letter to Mrs. Sheldrake.
Pick up your cards and let's go.
I don't want to talk to him.
Sure.  What's that funny smell?
It's very curious -- I could only find three and a half pair.
It's just that I'm the kind of guy who can't say no -- I don't mean to girls -- I mean --
Where?
Are you just making that up to make me feel better?
No -- just come as you are.
You ought to see my backhand.  And wait till I serve the meatballs.
It's a must -- gracious-living-wise.
The dishes?
Oh.
No, thank you.  I -- well, to tell you the truth --  -- I have this heavy date for tonight --
I'm fine all over.
Seven --  -- queen.
Yes, sir.
That's very flattering.
Look, Baxter, I'm not stupid. I know everything that goes on in this building -- in every department -- on every floor -- every day of the year.
Are you going to deny it?
Well, usually I slip it to them in the office and they leave it under the mat -- but never again -- I can promise you that --
You mean -- you and me? I thought you were taking the branch manager from Kansas City --
Relax, Baxter.
Yes, of course.
Oh, you don't have to worry --
No, you don't understand. She's a busybody -- always poking her nose into things -- and with that key passing back and forth -- why take chances?
Oh.  Well, if there's anything I can do for you --
And I've got good news for you, Baxter. All your troubles are over.
I know how worried you were about Miss Kubelik -- well, stop worrying -- I'm going to take her off your hands.
Swell. And don't think I've forgotten what you did for me.  This way, Baxter.
You know that other key to your apartment -- well, when we had that little scare about Miss Kubelik, I thought I'd better get rid of it quick -- so I threw it out the window of the commuter train.
Baxter, I picked you for my team because I thought you were a bright young man. You realize what you're doing? Not to me -- but to yourself. Normally it takes years to work your way up to the twenty-seventh floor -- but it takes only thirty seconds to be out on the street again. You dig?
No I didn't.
That's right, Mr. Sheldrake. I won't be needing it -- because I'm all washed up around here.
Save it. The old payola won't work any more. Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.
I know, Buddy-boy, I know.  But those things don't always run on schedule -- like a Greyhound bus.
Sure, sure.  Look, kid -- I put in a good word for you with Sheldrake, in Personnel.
Oh, yes.  She's the best operator in the building.
Oh, I'm very grateful.
Well, that's very nice of you -- but who is this?
Oh, yes, Mr. Dobisch.  I didn't recognize your voice --
I'm sorry, Mr. Dobisch.  You know I like to help you guys out -- but it's sort of late -- so why don't we make it some other time?
I hate to disappoint you -- I mean, many happy returns -- but not tonight --
Hi, Doc.  Had a late call?
Oh, that's not me.  It's just that once in a while, I have some people in for a drink.
Yeah.  Well -- see you, Doc.
Me?
Let me get my bag.
How many pills were in that bottle?
I don't know -- I mean -- I wasn't here -- you see -- we had some words earlier -- nothing serious, really -- what you might call a lovers' quarrel --
Something like that.
Sure.
Yeah -- I'm giving up the apartment.
Me? Oh, you mean my body. Don't worry, Doc -- it'll go to the University -- I'll put it in writing --
Forget it -- I didn't do it as a doctor -- I did it as a neighbor.  By the way, whatever happened to her?
Happy New Year.
All I wanted him to do was let Mickey out for Christmas.
Well, they haven't got me yet, baby. Dig up some ice from the kitchen and let's not waste any time -- preliminary-wise.
Good night.
The party's over.
It's an emergency -- see you some other time.
Why not? We don't owe Buddy-boy anything.
No.
Like old times. Same booth, same song --
Look, Jeff -- we had two wonderful months this summer -- and that was it. Happens all the time -- the wife and kids go away to the country, and the boss has a fling with the secretary or the manicurist -- or the elevator girl. Comes September, the picnic is over -- goodbye. The kids go back to school, the boss goes back to the wife, and the girl --  They don't make these shrimp like they used to.
Not here, Fran. Can't we go some place else?
Important?
Do I. That leaky little boat you rented -- and me in a black negligee and a life preserver --
Just trust me, baby -- we'll work it out somehow --
Let's get something straight, Jeff -- I never asked you to leave your wife.
Yeah, we better.
Of course I'm not here -- because the whole thing never happened -- I never took those pills -- I never loved you -- we never even met -- isn't that the way you want it?
Ring out the old year, ring in the new. Ring-a-ding-ding.
First you can't wait to get me up here, and now -- rush, rush, rush! Makes a person feel cheap.
Okay, okay. Look, Sylvia -- instead of Friday - could we make it Thursday night?
I'm sorry, Jeff. You know I could never hold my liquor --
Yeah.
I'm not that fond of blondes -- maybe I like brunettes --
I like all of them --
That's what there is to talk about -- my man -- I take a good care of my men --
Get out --
We can use some fifty caliber and a 16 too --
I will -- I assure you that -- You got a fifty on that H-34 -- leave the ammo in boxes -- I'll get my men to bring the first drum with 'em --
Moonby. Got any Winstons?
None.
Sort of.
We do.
I go up on missions. Listen Captain, buy me all the beer you want, but you better tell that asshole over there you're not going to find out anymore about me.
Call me what, sir?
They lined us all up in front of a hundred yards of prime rib -- magnificent meat, beautifully marbled.. Then they started throwing it in these big cauldrons, all of it -- boiling. I looked in, an' it was turning gray. I couldn't stand it. I went into radio school.
No shit.
Still got a lot of that stuff from Nha Trang. But we're running low on the other.
Looks that way.
God knows.
No -- most of 'em are still standing -- might've been disease.
First Air Cavalry. They're the ones gonna get us into the River.
I'll go with him --
You'll see soon enough -- get going, sailor --
This is my crew and my fucking boat, and I'm the responsible party.
We're Americans.
What is it?
Yeah -- he really dug his Playboy mag, man -- I mean like he was there when it arrived -- He just knew.
I wonder if that was the same copter.
Exactly -- you'll go up the Nung River in a Navy P.B.R. -- appear at Nu Mung Ba as if by accident, re-establish your acquintance with Colonel Kurtz, find out what's happened -- and why. Then terminate his command.
Charlie?
I've worked with them on occasions and I saw the movie , sir.
A lame ?
About what ?
We took them from the dead.  Now -- I assume you want to rest, to shower. We'll attend to your repairs after dinner.
A man of war is never bothered to aid an ally -- you will follow me, Captain.
I always thought the French came here to get the rubber.
What about an American named Kurtz?
Your daughter.
What?
Six to eight feet.
Affirmative, Big Duke Six -- We're even got some rockets left.
I met him.
So? I heard you had a good bunch of killers here.
I met him.
Who?
Yeah.
No. My thinking is clear.  But my soul has gone mad.
You can't have water after morphine.
I can handle it.
What Truth?
No water.
Because of all the things we do, the thing we do best -- is lie.
I'm taking you back. You can still live.
Yes I was... He said his last words to me.
Sure.
I wasn't looking.. I was running.
What is this bridge?
Where's Kurtz? I want to talk to him.
You're Australian?
Why didn't he shoot you?
I do.
Big show in the parade grounds this noon -- some boss stuff --
Wait 'til I'm across!
It'll be interesting, trying to build a fire without any wood.
I just want this over with.
I'd sure like that favor you offered a while back.
26   CONTINUED:
Knew you had no native blood, even with your dark hair.  Blue eyes give you away.  My wife had blue eyes.
That's why I left, moved to Washington.  When I met Eric I was doing day shoots -- products and fashion, mostly.  Pretty dull.  Eric was teaching college, and then he got the job with Northland Oil.  We wanted to stay together, so we talked them into funding some wilderness photography... and here I am.
I have not, but I very much want to.  What do you know about the trouble in Devil's Cauldron?
-- Corbett's a killer.
Why?
He still might be around.  I saw fresh tire tracks coming in.
He was sitting in a hot tub with a hooker.
-- Permanently?
Wait a second.
Nothing broken.  C'mon, we have to hurry.
My home is here.  With you.
Okay by me.  You're the one likes these hot springs so much.
No big deal.  We just got off on the wrong foot.  What's your name?
New to the country, kid?
Hunting and trapping was a damn fine life.  Me and Mitchell, Bob and LeMalle, we were teams.  I'd always go with Mitchell.  Good man, Mitchell.  I'd let Bob worry about goddamn LeMalle.  We'd hire a plane in October.  On the way to a dirt airstrip somewhere, we'd drop supplies.  We'd land, tell the pilot to come back for us a few days before Christmas.
I took the odds on getting down in one piece, and I made it.  Now we're in my territory.
We've got another two hours of daylight.
I'm here to do my job.
Too bad we're heading west.
How many do you see?
An appetite.  Maybe you won't die after all.
Told that's what our old man was. Planned on going to sea, me and Bob, 'til I read Jack London. Started trapping when I was ten. Mailed the furs to Sears.  Eight bucks for a skunk, three for a muskrat.  That was fine money.
You got a knack for seeing things the way you want to see them.
You broke the radio, remember?
Lets us watch each other's backs over a wide area.  Only thing messed me up this time was getting arrested in the baths. ELT was in my duffel bag, not around my neck where it should've been.
Why offer a buyoff with your gunmen waiting outside?
Like I said, I'd still be up on that mountain, frozen solid, it wasn't for you.
You left a footprint at the Sportsmen's camp.  Only pretty sight there, Ben, 'cause the two men you didn't shoot and mutilate died of exposure.
Good idea.  Flying over mountains can give you some nasty surprises.  Go too low, one of the clouds might have a big rock inside it.
I don't want to hurt you, Sam.
-- Forget it.  And try not to bleed on my throw rugs.  Why do this?
Corbett ruined my two-way.  Go to my place on the Haul Road, tell Anne Marie I'm okay and to sit tight.
You're an outsider, Mr. Desmond. Step aside; stay out of it.
What does this matter to you?
I should release Corbett because you want some votes?
Fuck you.
-- We appreciate the company. Anne Marie's getting cabin fever already.
Bet I could make some money turning Ben Corbett in.  Maybe more for lettin' him loose.  I was up in my cache.  Saw the Northland man come talk to you.
Dixie's waiting at the infirmary. She'll put a splint on that injured leg.
Aw, Jesus.  Told you this was trouble.  What about you, big shot?  Do something.  Who's side are you on, anyway?
Cool out.  I ain't about to get blasted.
Quit fucking around.  Get in.
Ease off.  We do this my way.
Closest planes for hire are here in Cache.
Musta wanted to keep him from the bears.  If Ben killed him, he sure as hell wouldn't hang him up like this.
They'll have to come right past us.
Huh?
Do you really want to go back to the runt doctors in Emergency who keep telling us they can't help?
Come on. Why fight when we know how it will come out. This isn't like stocking or a string of pearls. You don't send this one back.
Stop treating this like I'm going away with a man. He's just going to say those crappy, sick, complaining, angry things to me. I hate this, Mom -- I hate this. He's a freak show -- the worst person I ever met.
Everybody wants that, dear -- it doesn't exit...  Sorry... didn't mean to interrupt.
No, I didn't.  So why are you h...
I'm a waitress.
No.
His home number.
I've got Jews at my table.
I see the help -- judgement call.
It's okay -- I'll sit here.
What's with the dark?
What subject? That I wasn't there to take crap from you and bring you eggs? Do you have any control over how creepy you allow yourself to get?
Okay!!!! Anything else?!?
A thank-you note for what you did for me.
Are you still coming?
Thanks for being on time... Carol, the waitress, this is Simon, the fag.
Let me go in back. You look like you need all the room you can manage.
Go ahead, Simon. Your father walked in on you and was yelling and... really, come on.
Dancing?
Just him and that's it. Okay, you can answer -- we've worked it out.
You promised a nice place -- can't you just...  You have these dry cleaned all the time, don't you?
Then I've really overshot here 'cause I was aiming at just enough to keep you from walking out.
Tell me even if you're scared. Tell me why you wanted me here. It's okay.
It was a mistake.
This one has a special meaning.
Go ahead.
Okay. Good-bye.
'Cause if you were asleep -- I'm sorry. And you could be grouchy.
What a break...
Oh, come on in and try not to ruin everything by being you.
Our room. I don't want to see him and he's not going to come knocking on your door.
I don't think so. You need help with the pants?
You think you're kidding.
Don't want to. I love you.
Hey, elephant girl, call her or something...  just let her do my one meal here. I'll pay whatever. I'll wait.  Do it!!!
Your neighbor -- Udall -- is taking care of him.
Shhhh now. I like Simon. I like him enough to batter you unrecognizable if you verbally abuse him or so much as touch his dog again. Meanwhile, I'll try and think how you can make this up to him.  I hate doing this. I'm an art dealer.  Have a nice day. Party!
You don't want to mess with me today. I'll figure something else out tomorrow.
He's a pain in the ass.
Okay by me.
Do it.
Think white and get serious.
I haven't looked at myself yet. I figured I could tell from your reaction.
You little stinker. He's given you everything.
Frank's idea. He thought I should have notes so I did this right... maintained focus, didn't get emotional and tried not to terrify you.
Well, I can't reach them.
What's he look like?
Like thick molasses, with one of those wide noses perfect for smelling trouble and prison food...
Maybe this can wait.
Well, that's a load off.
That cleaning woman doesn't...
This stuff is pointless.
Not at all, huh?!... Let's go to the hotel. And if you're lucky tomorrow Dad will give you another wad of sweaty money.
I'm coming.
I don't know... Let me sleep on it and figure it out.  Because I'm stuck! Can't go back to what I had... She's evicted me from my life.
Well, if that's true then I'm really in trouble.
How about that pose?  This is not fun...  Give me some direction.
No. No. No. Hey, that painting in there...  I just want to tell you...
What restaurant?
But they caught the guy.  I heard it all.  Sounded like he just went berserk, fucking loco.  Shooting anybody.  Drugs, probably.
After those cops, you'll never be able to come back to Cleveland.
We go around once.
There's a sand barricade up ahead; I'm going to ram this cab into it. The cab has an airbag, odds are good I'll survive.  But with this steel casing and bullet proof glass, odds for you are not so good.
I know you're going to jump.
It means that I'm going to tell you things, even though I already know that you're not going to listen to a God damned thing I say.
Oh, yeah.
Why don't you tell me.
Now I'll tell you something.  It wouldn't fucking matter if I offered you one hundred million dollars. You'd still be thinking the same thing, that you're going to take me. And here I am, sitting through this, knowing it's bullshit, looking at you and the only thing going on in my mind, the only thing I can think is that, in just a few minutes I'm going to take you.
Do you want Rath or not?
Tomorrow.  The buyer is Japanese. His retirement a condition of the bonus.
Robert?  Robert?
He has to clean up.  How many bodies were there?
One hour per man.
I'm part of the game, just like you.
Yes.
No.  It's the truth.  I know what you are.  Like me, like Bain, you're a ghost, you're not part of the real world.  You don't have a social security number.  You don't pay taxes.  You've probably used ten different names over the last ten years.  A long time ago something probably happened, something illegal and you ran, you disappeared and it was easy.  You think you can do it again.  But I'm telling you, fading from the law is nothing.  No matter what you do, where you go, I swear to you that Bain will find you.
He was Russian.  Nicholai Tachlinkov.  A legend in the business when I was just starting. I admired him.  When I heard he loved chess I became obsessed with the game.
We played with a code using <u>The New</u> <u>York Times</u> obituaries.  Over three years we played twelve matches.  I never won.
He was killed.
They didn't give you a choice, did they?
But you knew what they were training you for?
Why did you leave the Agency?
Are they usually like that?
Did it ever bother you?
You said you didn't trust it.
What?
Yes.
No.
I don't know... maybe I'll live on a boat, sail to all the places I've never been.
Here?
Okay.
Sorry.
Thank you.
Why won't he wait until the bank closes?
That means you won't have a gun.
And with the mikes, I'll tell you when he leaves the hotel and you'll tell me when he leaves the bank.
Sounds pretty well figured out.
Except, if he doesn't come out of the hotel.
I don't know.  It just happened.  I was here ten years ago, I'm here now.  That's it.
He said I couldn't win.  That no one wins at this game.
No.
So?
Why in the hell would you take that chance?
Thank you.
It's always been that way.  The world has always functioned on two levels.
I'm sure you will.
Yes.
Why?
Shit.
Right.
Electra --
How can a beautiful man like you be shy?
I called because I just want... I need to talk.
Yes.
Just a little ways.  Up to those trees.
Sure.
Why not?
A dime.
Average.
Taken.
American currency.
I have all day.
A coke, if they have it?
No you don't get it. Every cabby in town knows this joint. So where's the mystery, the danger?
We're only joking.....It is your round though!
You're outnumbered Kat two to one, got to go with the majority, that's democracy.
No, just crap. I want some picture frames.
Give'em a break Doug, all it takes is a little work.
This place is getting expensive too, used to be twelve.
No thanks, I think we ought to get going though.
Yeah, that could be job number two. I think it's a sewer.
That makes you an expert I guess.
I'll settle for a pardon. You gotta drill?
And if the police stop by - what do I tell them?
Thought of everything haven't you.
You're nuts man, Katka's right!
'cause you stink of booze.
Yes, but it suddenly clicked, this is going to be a crazy place and, since the Commies are used to seeking asylum, we can use that in the marketing.
I don't know Doug, we haven't even got the place together and already you want to extend it.
Yeah, I'll take some.
See if she can donate some paintings or something to hang on these walls, give it a bit of atmosphere.
Could you handle it if it was in a good cause?
Jesus Doug, they'll execute us!
We don't speak Czech!
Am I late?
Who put a bee up your butt?
Forget it Doug, it's no good.
No, the boyfriend.
What?
He's lying! I am.
No, but I ran into Jahn, seems him and his friends are in big trouble with the University, they might even be expelled.
What happened?
No point, it'll be in Czech and God knows what format. But if I'm right, they could be my ticket out of here.
You're in the clear, keep it that way, I'll be okay.
No!
Good we'll take Josh's Jeep, come on!
So am I.
We should go to the Metro it's quicker.
Fernet and tonic.
I'm not a bloody teenager okay, I told you I can't do that shit.
There's nothing there for me.
But I love you!
And, since it's only two streets away, I suggest we go take a look. Now!
Don't worry, I've got lots of friends.
Well, I want them to put down a floor and a walkway.
It's not so much.
Don't go making it too simple, we're on the cutting edge here.
Cool....So, if we say eight o'clock.
Yo, dobree!
Yeah, great....Dobchay! It will dry, yes?
Good, great....Dobchay!
Of course, you can see that lady over there, she is recording everything.
Am I invited?
Thanks.
Well, I've failed at everything else I've done and I can't hack it as a journalist, even for the Bugler.
Yeah seems okay.
No, just a coffee.
I'll be okay, just get me home.
Yeah, but it was okay.
Hmm, I still owe him.
It's Josh's.
Yes, they had nothing to do with it.
Fuck you!
I lied to you, I didn't destroy the floppy disks.
The choice is yours, it's not negotiable.
Yeah!
Good, wait here, it will not take long and then you may go.
Working....Under cover.
Yeah.
Just yesterday.
Oh that's it? Everything I do is crap!
Later.
Leave me, just leave me alone Josh.
Josh, I have to speak you, it's urgent.
Yes, if you can get him free.
This press we cannot control. Americans, I think.
In a building belonging to the University in the Old Town.
Yes, I think so, it is still barred, but it is not the University who are in the building.
Because she doesn't know what a hint is.
Kelly wouldn't do that.
About a job.
No. I won't be long.
I meant he's a doctor.
Mom, great. But what I want is for me to be proud of me.
I didn't know either.
I'm just wondering --
York Ave.
Later.
No. Hey. We're sorry, man!
Me.
Like what? The moons of Jupiter?
I don't want to have any conversation.
Like me.
Kinda. Yeah.
Are you asking to mock me or do you really want to know?
I do know.  Be two places at once... learn to hit a baseball or turn a cartwheel... eat breakfast with chopsticks...
Don't bother!
That's it! Exactly! You're reading my mind --
Healthy as can be.
That sounds like horseshit.
And why would that scare me?
You're sometimes not sure?
Twice a year.
Where?
The truth. I just left you out of it.
Me.
I will.
Anything you want.
I was going to fake it.
Because you have hope that you'll get better?
Dad --
I was wrong. Nobody could have wanted or loved your mother more than we did. Not even God.
She did. It was you.
I'm no dummy.
That's right.  The world is your oyster.
I want to come back.
I didn't say you did.
Uh, yes, sir...
I don't know. National Cash Register?
Oh yeah.
Poly-what?
Oh, I'm feeling much better now.
Nine o' clock.  Oh, I'm late! Maybe I'll see you later.
But he didn't ask me.
You mean like how you're supposed to act with someone on a first date?
How are you?
Learn anything?
Good.
Say what you were supposed to say in the cafeteria.
Nothing. Look, I'll write it down for you, okay?
Bic... It's a Bic pen.
You're not gonna hurt me. Just hit me in the stomach.
I'm going to be at the dance.
Unfortunately, the way things are going, you may get your wish. You may see the entire annhiliation of the world. If not, you'll certainly see the destruction of all out natural resources. We can already see the air we breathe, not to mention the pollution in our rivers and lakes. We'll  see all of our oil reserves depleted, in fact, all of our energy sources. Yes, you people have a lot to look forward to -- a lot to see.
What year?
No, no, not beyond an acceptable level. Have you been X-rayed recently, Martin?
Home, school, here...
Pro! Release the rope!
Get behind the shield! I'm about to release radiation!
Then where the hell is he?
Precisely!
Professor, can this thing send Shemp back in time?
Must have been? Used to live? I do live here.
Oh. That expression probably hasn't been invented yet... I can get behind -- I agree with you.
That's just great!
You were ringing the doorbell!
Okay, Professor, I get where you're coming from. The way I look, the way I'm dressed...  I'd stick out like a sore thumb.
You're talking crazy! An atomic blast would melt me and the time machine in a matter of seconds!
Oh -- that -- I found it in the closet.
Well, it was there.
You better make sure your old man asks her out, because if he doesn't, they may never have a first date. And if they don't have a first date, they won't have a second date. If they don't have a second date, they won't fall in love. If they don't fall in love, they won't get married, and if they don't get married, you'll never be born!
Are you trying to tell me that my mother's got the hots for me?
We're at one and a half miles, so you're just a little over a mile from where you want to be,  Wait until minus 3 minutes before you go -- that should give you plenty of time, and it should be close enough to zero hour that they can't do anything to stop you. Park the truck at 800 and get in the refri-- the time chamber. Just be sure the nose of the truck is pointed at the bomb....the power converter will do the rest.
Professor -- there are some doors that shouldn't be opened, Marty said softly, without turning around.
87 states? Time travel bans? What the hell?
Dick Wilson? Dickie Wilson? Dickie Wilson runs this place? That's a laugh!
He said not to tell.
Running this place for a fella in town. Nothing much to speak of.
Okay.
Yeah.
Wouldn't be here if I hadn't.
Mmmmm.
Sure thing. Come on.
Tom...
Is that right?
No.
What for?
Well, I don't mind getting up early, so I got a job throwing garbage... I'm not in love with the stuff, okay.
He'll say that?
Well, stop the world.
Yeah, but I don't like it.
Okay.
Yeah.
We better call the doctor... Listen. I'll say how it happened, part I saw.
How's he doing?
Just looking.
I don't know.
Yeah.
Guess there's no way I'll ever know. For sure.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, I'd like to leave a message, if that's okay.
Yes.
Stay as long as you like.
Maybe.
Wanta sue me?
Arachtoids.  From Planet Ten.
And try the President's private number at the hospital.  Make sure this is on the level. We're busy people here.
Just 'grazed' you, huh?
Arachtoid.
It?  Who does?
Where's the professor?
Don't look at me, Buckaroo Banzai.  I failed flight school.
Now, Buckaroo Banzai?
Figures.  Anybody seen my scope?
Stole his body?  When Doctor Lizardo's hair turned red and his mind snapped?  Of course!  What else?
Penny.  I'd rather not reveal my last name or my age.
Who were you really trying to kill last night?
Pretty terrible shot.
Who?
You're quite serious about this, aren't you, Buckaroo.  We know each other pretty well, I think.
A black thermopod here?  On Earth?!  Why, John Gomez?  Why?
I have a radio fix...
Possible atmospheric condition, sir...solar.  It's unusual, but no cause for alarm.  Intelligence reports the Soviets are having the same problem.
Nigh on ten years.  Been through a lotta scrapes together.
Perfect Tommy's just threatened by smart women.  Can you play that thing?
Hell they don't. I met my first wife that way.
You're thinking of Mr. Wizard.  This guy's an eccentric genius.
No!  Ditto the professor-
He will be... When he can't write, he drinks.
Yes I am. I'm working on a wres  please call me Barton.
That son of a bitch... Don't get me wrong, he's a fine writer.
What?! He's a son of a bitch!
Hello.
...Who is this?
What do you mean so to speak?! Audrey, how long have you been his... secretary?
Hah!
That's hamburger grease, Bill.
That doesn't help anything, Bill.
Not anything, Bill. Don't test me.
What!?  Ted Okum doesn't know shit. They've assigned me enough pictures for a goddamn year. What Ted Okum doesn't know you could almost squeeze into the Hollywood Bowl.
But Lipnik said he wanted to look at the script, see something by the end of the week.
Nothing. It's just a mosquito bite.
Well, I've talked to Bill Mayhew-
Are you deaf, he LIKES you! He's taken an interest! What the hell did you say to him?
Well he's taken an interest!  That means he'll make your life hell, which I could care less about, but since I drew the short straw to supervise this turkey, he's gonna be all over me too! Fat-assed sonofabitch called me yesterday to ask how it's going  don't worry, I covered for you. Told him you were making progress and we were all very excited. I told him it was great, so now MY ass is on the line.  He wants you to tell him all about it tomorrow.
Don't panic, I'll join you in a minute.  What's you think of Richard and Poppy?
I'm not sure anymore. I guess I try to make a difference.
Yes... Isn't it?
That's all right, really, thank you.
Well, I'm a writer, actually.
Hell, why not? Everyone wants quality. What kind of venue, that is to say, thematically, uh...
Well, that's a good question. Strange as it may seem, Charlie, I guess I write about people like you. The average working stiff. The common man.
Yeah, I guess it is. But in a way, that's exactly the point. There's a few people in New York  hopefully our numbers are growing  who feel we have an opportunity now to forge something real out of everyday experience, create a theater for the masses that's based on a few simple truths  not on some shopworn abstractions about drama that doesn't hold true today, if they ever did...
Seen a doctor?
Okay, but hell, you should know what it is. I can show you in about thirty seconds.
Well it's... it's a defense mechanism.
Know about it? I can practically see how they're doin' it. Brother, I wish I had a piece of that.
Well...
Charlie, I'm in trouble. You've gotta help me.
But I didn't do it  don't you believe me?
Everything's okay, believe me. I know it's rough mentally, but everything's taken care of.
Don't worry about that, compadre. I'll be back.
Lou.
KISS THIS MAN'S FEET!!
I apologize, Barton.
Mr. Lipnik.
Congratulations.
The others are being sent.
Uh-huh.
What do you do, Fink?
Female caucasian, thirty years old. Nice tits. No head. You ever see Mundt with anyone meets that description?
You didn't tell us you knew the dame.
...Fred...
Excellent picture.
No, not yet Jack. We just bought the story. Saturday Evening Post.
Mr. Lipnik, please 
Yeah.
When did you start drinking again?
Going after him before gets you off the hook for killing him that's your alibi.
Bring 1976 up.
I'm fine.  Come on, Beth!  You know I'm fine!  How the hell long do I have to keep doing this?
It's been three months.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Nilsen.
Yes.  I care about you.  I did it for you.
I don't need any help.
I know the type.  I'm a psychologist.
She's evil.  She's brilliant.  Be careful, Nick.
I got a message on my machine to meet Gus here.  Where is he?
What?
It won't last.
I have nothing to hide.
That's right.
You still get the pleasure.  Didn't you ever fuck anybody else while you were married, Nick?
You know I don't like to wear any underwear, don't you, Nick?
No.  Come in.
I don't know.  But you do.
Four shootings in five years.  All accidents.
There's a name from the past.
Didn't you study it in school?
You can make a mistake.
Isn't he the policeman that you shot, Shooter?
There's Pepsi in the fridge.
What do you want from me, Catherine?
You mean did I write it before my parents died?
No.  I wrote it years afterwards.
I told her it was the fuck of the century.
Try me.
I don't know.
Honey, why don't you go in the car?  I'll be right there.
Of course I knew.
I found Lisa Henderson.
Did you miss me?
Somebody has to die.
Exactly what do you have in mind, Mr. Corrigan.
What was the weapon?
The usual -- a girlfriend.
I didn't know you knew who Picasso was, Gus.
Somethin', though.
I feel fine!
You think I'd let you drive my Cadillac car?  I ain't lettin' no hear-up-his-ass person drive my Cadillac car.
She's right.  You got an icepick in you yet?
Which one you talkin' about now, son?  We know ole Hazel did it; we know young Roxy did it -- and the other one Well, hell, she's got that magna come lawdy pussy on her that done fried up your brain.
Is he dead?
Formerly engaged to Roberto Vasquez, deceased --
She didn't ask me for the ride. She asked anybody.
How the fuck do you know?  What is it with you and this broad anyway?
Her parents died in an accident. I don't care what else she's written.  What are you -- a book critic?
What about me?
No.
I don't think she meant to go off the hill, do you?
Maybe that's what you're counting on to get you off the hook.
Are you vice?
Fourteen.  We seal juvenile records until they're deceased.  That's why you didn't find it in your computer.
Can you check again?
Can there be some mistake?
Rene's been telling me about your work.
I like the one with the dragon's heads a lot. But the black one's filled up with too many heads...  I'd take some of them out.  I think you're painting too fast. I wouldn't put in so many heads. Let it breathe a bit.
You're right. It's your version. You should come over to the studio sometime.
No, I wanted to make a painting of you.
The whole thing  painting.
I think it's in New Jersey.
That's good. At least they're interested.
We can do better. It needed more white.
When I was poor, everybody doubted I could make it. When I got rich, everyone said, `yeah, but he'll never keep it up.' Now everyone says `he's killing himself.' So I clean up, and then they say `Look. His art's dead.' I don't take drugs, anyway. I'm healthy now.
Annina Nosei.
You should talk to him about this.
You haven't been by lately.
You name it, I paint there.
I know.
Decipher?
Well, you said that.  You've got a lot of references from Leonardo da Vinci, don't you?
Not black.
Who said that?
Chateau Latour '64, please.
Very well.
Yeah..
Use your fucking instinct.
We're getting married. She said she could tell I was a great artist  she could see it in my eyes. She said she wanted to be by my side and have inter-racial babies with me.
Ummm... Four years. Six to get rich.
He's the best painter in the world. I'm gonna give him one of these.
Yeah... I'll paint on it.
What's your fuckin' problem, anyway?
Hey fuck you! I deserve this shit. You're just jealous 'cause it ain't happening to you!
Just come to the Mudd Club on Friday.
C'mon, baby, I painted them for you. They're beautiful now.
You don't have any fucking money..
What who's saying?
You're blaming me? I had to go see my family.
I hadn't thought about it.
A present I picked up for you.
Sure. I'd be glad to.
Stand still.
Haitian. I'm going to kill myself. I'm taking pills. Reds, blues, greens.
No! I have a boyfriend. He loves me.
No, I don't. I'm alone. We all are. Especially here. The world's unjust. The respect fools get. The disrespect I get.
You don't even know me. I want real respect.
So what?
Thanks... I'll take it tonight.
That's impossible. I've got, like, five of 'em!
I just don't think you're being fair.
It's vichyssoise, sir.
"Affair" ... yes, maybe ... if she ...
Things change.  Hey, good to meet you.  We'll be working hand in glove in Gotham's glorious future.
Maybe you're right.
Have we?
Well, I could ... free up some time...
I'm tempted.
Yes and no...
Y'mean take off our costumes?
I don't know.  Till we figure it out, let's ... let's keep dancing.
Damn those Carny bolsheviks the other night, throwing bricks at my windows --
Wayne, I'll not stand for mud- slinging in this office.  If my assistant were here, she'd already have escorted you out, to --
Yes, did -- did you injure yourself on that ski slope?  Is that why you cut short your vacation and came back?
It does to me.
Your blood, Max.
He <u>is</u> Batman, you moron.
One way to find out?
Down, Oswald.  We have to talk.  You see we've got something in common.
I have but one pet cause, today: Ban The Bat.
PMS.
Silent night, violent night...
But who could've ... no, don't say it.
What about the documents that prove you own half the firetraps in Gotham?
A big bag of fan mail?  Filthy lucre?  Wait don't tell me ... Is it a broad?
Yes, adulation is a cross to bear. God knows <u>I</u> know.  But someone's got to supplant our standing-in- the-way-of-progress Mayor and don't deny it, Mr. Cobblepot, you've got the magic!
Oswald:  We need one more thing.
Point is, listen to them.  They've lost faith in old symbols. They're ready to bond with you, the icon of the future.  If it works, don't fix it...
I'm the one you want!  Penguin, please!  Ask yourself:  Isn't it Max Shreck who manipulated and betrayed you?  Isn't it Max, not Chip, whom you want to see immersed up to his eyeballs in raw sewage?
No, I am.  Yes, I'm boning up for your Bruce Wayne meeting in the morning.  I pulled all the files on the proposed power plant, and Mr. Wayne's hoped-for investment... I've studied up on all of it ... I even opened the protected files and --
Well I figured that your password was "Finster."  Your Pomeranian. And it was.  And it's all very interesting, though a bit on the technical side, I mean about how the power plant is a power plant in name only since in fact it's gonna be one big giant...
I'm no cat.  I'm just an assistant. A <u>secretary</u> --
As I've missed you.  Sleep well, child.
What is it?
In spirit only, I'm afraid.
There's a lovely inn just down --
Alfred, I know you're sick -- I can get you the best doctors.
Everyone dies, Master Bruce.  There's no defeat in that.  Victory comes in fighting for what we know is right while we still live.
What seems to be the problem?
It appears, sir, that someone has stolen the batsignal.
I recognized the accent.
I'm so sorry to trouble you, but-
Whatever you say, lady.  It's all in a day's work for me.
Keep it.
Alfred's happy here.
Batgirl, Baatgirl, Baatgirl.
I hate being lectured.
Surf's up.
Me too.  Great stems, though.
Can he save her?
Kill her later.  We've got work to do.
From the other side of the equator-
Actually, I already work for you. Or did.  Your arboreal preservation project in South America.
Although the Wayne Foundation is hosting the event, sadly I will be unable to attend.  Thank you all.  Good day, Doctor.
Somehow he survived.  But the cryoslution mutated his body.
We gonna trap ourselves a snowman?
Yes.  But Alfred's condition is less severe.  Freeze's research says he cured a case like Alfred's.  It just doesn't say how.
Yes!  Yes, I want her so badly I can taste it.  That's the whole point. Look at us.  Orphans.  Isolated. Obsessed to the exclusion of life, love, family.  We're perfect targets. She's done something to us, got us fighting over her somehow.
I always go a size smaller.  Makes me look slimmer.
You are looking unseasonably hot. Let's go inside and grab your rocks.
OK, OK.  Ms. Ivy to the rescue.  Now where do I find your brittle bride?
Kill them.  Of course.  But why stop there?  Why should only Batman and Robin die while the society that created them goes unpunished?
Just what I had in mind.  Everything dead on Earth except us.  A chance for mother nature to start again.  Plants and flowers are the oldest species on the planet yet they are defenseless against man.  Sorry hon, this is for science.  Behold the dawn of a new age.
I'm hungry.  I think I'll have poultry.
Not good.
I want us to be together.  But I need to know you're serious about turning over a new leaf.  I need a sign.
Then you never loved me?
Our work?
I think they're getting worse.
Then you'd have nothing to complain about.
I don't know, sir. Your dear parents.  Suddenly gone. So much loss...
He boosted the Jag?  Is that all?
Why, indeed?
Dr. Meridian...
What?
Of course. 13 is M....MRE.
Enigma.
How ya doin', Al?
I'm flattered. Not every girl makes a super-hero's night table.  You might have some interesting insights into Two-Face.
Let's just say I could write a hell of a paper on a grown man who dresses like a flying rodent.
I didn't know that. See? You _are_ interesting. And call me Chase. By the way, do you have a first name? Or do I just call you bats?
Try a fireman. Less to take off.
Maybe you just haven't met the right woman...
Did Two-Face call him Bruce?
No more tricks, Edward. Release Chase and Dick. This is between you and me.
For _me_? Really? Tell me.
Oh please. You're blind as a bat.
Wait. You can't go.
Slanta.
Somebody's been sending me love letters. Commissioner Gordon thought you might give me your expert opinion.
Wacko? That a technical term?
So what you're saying, this guy's a total wacko, right?
Would you? I'm not so sure.
I don't get you Bruce Wayne.
The glib, cavalier routine, it really is an act, isn't it?
What?
Rage. Anger. Passion. Pain.
So how goes your `scholarly' pursuit of Batman?
Excuse me, boys. I'd hate to stop this testosterone flood on my account-
Okay, tiger, take it slow. You going to give me your pin or something?
I don't want to remember!
What?
Dick, let go. Revenge will eat you alive. Trust me. I know.
Of course you are. And what a grand pursuit you must be.  What do you think of my new invention?
How could I forget?
...Fired...your fired...your fired. You understand?! Fired!!
Never heard of a double-cross?
You _are_ Two-Face, you would need to face both rivers, both uptown and downtown simultaneously. Only one spot in Gotham serves these bi- zonal, bi-coastal needs...
Addictive isn't it? Just Say No. Until I say yes. A little fringe benefit of working with me. Now here's the concept, counselor. Crime. My I.Q., your AK-47. You help me gather production capital so I can produce enough of these  to create an empire that will eclipse Bruce Wayne's forever. And, in return I will help you solve the greatest riddle of all. Who is Batman?
Haven't you had enough? Don't Think And Drive.
Don't bogart that 'trode.
You're a genius.
A miss. And my favorite vitamin, I might add.
Alexander Knox. Gotham Globe.
Thank you, Alfred.  I hope you'll excuse me.  It was a great pleasure meeting you.  And you.
Respectfully, sir... there'll never be another one like you.
I just wanted to distract them. I wasn't trying to get a picture of you.
Look, I appreciate what you did for me. But this is my job. And I'm keeping those pictures.
Quite a while. I took the scenic route.
You could've killed him, you know. You could've killed the Joker.
You're just back from Corto Maltese.  I saw your combat photos.  Quite a departure for you.
Tell me, Knox. If you've got the story, why haven't you printed it?
Yeah, a drink. 'Civilized,' right?
Too much work.  I'm not really the physical type -- Thank you, Alfred.
That's a tough one.  Have you ever seen combat?
... Terror.
Maybe we should just kiss.
... Looks like a convention.
Yes, Bruce -- I'm here --
Well, Bruce -- I don't think -- that would be possible.
Finding out where she is.
It's a detour. They're backed up for blocks!
Eckhardt... our problems are your problems.
No shit.  It was all over the pavement.
Jack?  Thank God.  I can't believe it's you.  I heard you'd been --
JACK?  JACK?  DO I LOOK LIKE A JACK?
HA!  That's the best part. I CAN'T!!
Goddammit, I expect to be treated like and ARTIST. GET OFF MY SCREEN!!
Strong stomach, huh?  I like that in a woman -- Maybe we can do business after all.
Miss Vale, was it something I said?  Do you want to sniff my flower?
Too much glamor, huh.  What's in the bag - - Monte Carlo?  Apes in Kenya?
A girl could get killed - - so they tell me.  What's new and hot in Gotham City?
Yeah?  According to this, he's in Geneva from '76 to '79. Well, I called Geneva.  Nobody there's even heard of the guy - - Probably off in Tibet with some kung fu master.
God yes, Allie. I've gotta say -- that was the ballsiest move I ever...
And they asked me if we'd like to ... you know... put him up for a while.
David, I'm serious!
It was nothing.  We're not ... He just makes me laugh.  When was the last time we laughed?  Any of us?
Annie, it's me.
Uh ... yes ...
But the particular glory of the system... is that it can also work oh large screens in each individual room - so we can network the program to every room in the gallery.
Not necessarily.  That's where this ...  comes in.  No, I've had a better idea than sacking people.  You'll hear soon enough.
Yes, look, I wanted to talk to you about this.  I'm sure we haven't been doing as badly as all that.
Well, bravo!  What with you and Whistler's Ma - I think I've got a winning team.
And that's where you introduce me to the Governor.
Thank you Bernie.  Well done.  Now, If you'll excuse - I have a little smartening up to do myself.
Time taken its toll on the old girl, eh?
And a car.
Okay, so the guy's gonna look like Meatloaf's backside.  No-one's asking you to go to bed with him.
Jennifer!  This is not - repeat, not! how we do things in this family. I've told you never to get on one of those death traps!  Please - talk to me.  I promise to be reasonable.
Damn.  I was just going to Number 4 ....
I am sorry you feel that way.
NO, seriously - I know he's your boyfriend, but there's something about his upper lip that is so weird.  What do you think it is, Dad?  Jen says it's a moustache, I say it's a cluster of about 11 mosquitoes, resting.
Entert-ain...us...an-us...Oh yeah! Heh heh. Anus. Heh heh.
Yeah, heh heh. Maybe it has a TV. Heh heh. TV.
What's your problem Beavis?
Shut up Beavis! Uh, yeah. We'll do your wife.
Uh... Uh...
Me first! Me first!
Huh huh. We're gonna score now.
Yeah, heh heh. Damn right!
Huh? Huh huh.
C'mon, Beavis, just start running really fast when you hit the ground. It'll work.
Uh, oh yeah. Cool. They can take us to Washington and we can finally score.
Yeah. We can go see Hole and then we can get some hole. Huh huh huh huh.
What's your problem Beavis?
Yeah, he had a lot of problems. Huh huh huh.
Yer late.
That's alright. I'd rather not know your real names anyways. I'm Muddy. Look, I'm gonna get right to the point. I'll pay you ten grand plus expenses, all payable after you do her...
Yeah, I'm hoping to do some sluts too. Heh heh. Do they have lots of sluts in Las Vegas?
Whoa! heh heh. Hey Butt-Head, this chick is pretty cool. She says there's gonna be tons of sluts in Las Vegas! Heh heh heh.
Oh, maybe you're lactose intolerant.
Well, if you find yourself getting tired, take a couple of these.
Why it's you two. How'd ya do in Vegas?
Um, um, yeah, probably. Heh heh.
Dammit!  Where's that damn unit??!!
Bork, don't you realize what kids today are capable of? Don't you read the papers?
Well, sir it's not good.  Roll the tape... The X-5 unit is a new top-secret biological weapon, a manmade virus...
It gets worse. The unit wasn't finished. It has a flaw - the casing. If hit hard enough, it could break open, releasing the virus.
D.C., Chief.
Damn! Where the hell is he? We should've found him by now.
Whoa, huh huh. Cool.
Uh, huh huh, this fat dude. He said we could do you. And he was gonna pay us.
Uh, ten uh...
Uh, you want us to do a guy? Huh huh. No way.
We're rich in what really matters.
Oh, honey, I'm so glad we're spending our vacation at home.
It's <u>your</u> turn, darling.
Ah, the ever-tactful Jane.  Let's just relax about having children.
I know... I just wish she'd leave us alone.
Yes it did.  Yes it did.  I made a couple of small discoveries. Here's one.
I can't clean anything.  The vacuum is out in the garage.  I can't leave the house.  Why don't they tell us something?  Where are all the other dead people in the world?  Why is it just you and me?
I don't know if there's anything we can do.
This is different.  Eventually she'll take someone to the attic. And then what?  We've got to try to contact this guy Betelmyer. We gotta get some help, hon.
Oh, Adam.  I don't have gloves.  My nails keep getting longer.  I'll break them.
I am not going to expose that little girl to that... pervert down there.
He might have hurt somebody.
I didn't --
... we wouldn't have had our little accident.
Just a hunch.
All right.
<u>Night of the Living Dead</u>?  It's this gross movie.
Really.  I don't know.
Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to work I go!
You wish!  I nearly scored with that little blonde.  I need me a short little queen.
Home.  <u>Home</u>.  <u>Home</u>!
We need help.  We deserve help.
What do you expect?  You're dead.
Pity.  Murderers seem to have an easy time of it.  Just look at Amityville.  He was one of my boys.  Didn't have to give that one any lessons. From day one... But I must be off ... I've got a planeload of football players crashed in the midwest... they need a lot of help, just with the basics.
About what?
Wait... I don't think it would be a very good idea if you told your parents that we're up here.
Step... mother.
It was gross. They wanted me to dissect a frog. I told them no way.  I said it was against my religion.  I got a C.
That's right, Jane.  Complete vacation.
And live in what, our station wagon?
They're dead.
Well, it can't be any worse than my life here.
Yes.
It's spelled different, but basically... Now you said it twice; just one more time, and I'll be free.  And then <u>you'll</u> be free.
You've <u>got</u> to say it!
... I will.
There's only one Chinese restaurant in town, darling, the owners are Irish and Irish people happen to cook Cantonese.  They don't know better.
What's he going to do?  Viciously rearrange their environment?
Delia hates it.
Lydia, we're the first trickle! In a couple of years this whole town will be <u>filled</u> with people like us.
Stepmother.  She's out torturing the movers.
No listen... we'll talk about this visiting later, I gotta go, I gotta meeting on the Japanese joint venture.
They're already dead.  They can't feel a thing.
I say let's keep it the way it is.
Of <u>course</u> we weren't scared.  Just a little startled.  One of those sushi dropped down my Kamali.
Shhhh.  They didn't commit suicide.
I'm <u>so</u> glad you could leave the city to consult me, Otho.
Be brave!  Otho take care!  Onward!
<u>No</u>!  Do not encourage this little... person.
Look at the tiny figures.
My sentiments exactly.  Porcelain is for teeth!
Why not?
Claim...? ... Oh, claim, that's what Thomas asked me.
Yes, Robert. I will.
It's fine today, Robert.
Hardly any, Robert.
I see...  ... And you are really a gardener, aren't you?
To everyone, I'm afraid. The Government controls are so restricting that the Medical Profession, as we know it, is being legislated out of existence.
We have common foes, Chauncey - kid lawyers and our physician!
In a minute, Robert - in a minute... Chauncey, I would like to ask a favor of you...
It's not good, Ben - I'm sure you can feel it.
Yes, he is different... Not the kind of person one usually meets in Washington.
Chauncey is so sensitive... He was overcome with grief...
I have no idea...
Gentlemen, needless to say, there is going to be a full Congressional investigation of your respective operations.  Good night.
Please, hold still, Mr. Gardiner.
Thank you.
Oh, yes.
Yes, I have seen that show on television.
No. I like this attic very much.
Oh? Certainly...
Yes.
No. The Old Man died and Louise left.
Ben is very ill, Eve - I've seen that before.
I like Ben very much... He reminds me of the Old Man...
Fine. He's very nice.
Yes, Eve. You'll be all right.
I see.
Good night, Eve.
I like the President. He is a very nice man.
No, Eve. I like you to be here.
Chauncey, this is Mr. Dennis Watson of the State Department.
That's very interesting, Eve.
No. I'm not busy.
Yes, very well, thank you.
Yes, I do, it's very good.
Yes, Eve. I shall yield too.
We are not far...  ... our chairs almost touch.
Do you think so? Do you think so?
Thank you, Ben. The garden that I left was such a place. Everything which grew there was with the labor of my own hands. I planted seeds and watered them and watched everything grow.
Yes. That is correct.
No, Ben.
Thank you, Ben.
Good. Together, the two of you should create quite a stir - I can already hear the gossip.
Yes, Ben - are you going to die now?
Yes. I like to watch very much.
Yes.
Yes. I would like to go to Rand Memorial Hospital.
No.  That's where Joe fixed the bricks.
... Good evening, Louise.
Yes. It is.
Yes.
No. I don't object.
Yes. I was there with Ben.
Yes.
Yes. I'm waiting for my lunch.
Yes. It's very cold outside today, isn't it, Thomas?
I have no need for a doctor or dentist. I have never been ill. I have never been allowed outside of this house, and, except for Joe, I have never had any visitors.
You have me, I am here. What more proof do you need?
I would like to stay and work in my garden.
I think you do, Mr. Chance. However, I will reiterate, this house is closed and you must leave...  Call me if you change your mind about signing.  C'mon, Sally - let's grab a bite...
Yes, I will.
As long as the roots are not severed, all is well and all will be well in the garden.
That is correct. In a garden, growth has its season. There is spring and summer, but there is also fall and winter. And then spring and summer again...
... Nothing.
... I realize this sounds banal but there is no information of any sort on Gardiner. We have no material on him - zilch...
Try again.
Good evening, Wilson.
Thank you, Wilson. That will be fine.
Sophie, this is Chauncey Gardiner...
Oh, no, sweetheart - it's not you...
It's not that, I just...
Sorry, Comrade Ambassador.
Gardiner, yes, sir.
Yes, Mr. President, we attempted to contact Mr. Rand, but he was too ill to...
Right, Chief.
I'm sorry, too. Well, Nancy wanted me to send along her best to the two of you - and, Ben, I want to thank you for your time and thoughts.
Now, Ben, I won't have any of that. Why don't you listen to your good friend Chauncey this is a time to think of life!
Okay.
Malkovich!
Craig, listen, honey, I've been thinking... maybe you'd feel better if you got, you know, a job or something.
Craig, everyone can't be Derek Mantini.  Well, grub worms are waiting. Do me a favor?
Hmmm.
I'm sorry. How was your evening?
Tomorrow. We're late for Lester.
You've always loved the animals.
What's that?
I feel that somehow my parents never prepared me to make this particular decision. Not that I blame them. How could they know? Today's world is so complicated.  No. I have to go away now. I'm sorry, Lotte. I'm so sorry.
It'll never happen, fuckface.
What's that?
That's true. Oh, God, Lotte, what have I become? My wife in a cage with a monkey. A gun in my hand. Betrayal in my heart.
I love you so much.
I'm sorry for everything.
You'll have me, after all I've done to you?
I can't believe it. This is too good to be true.
That... was... no... simulation.
This portal is mine and must be sealed up forever. For the love of God.
It's my head, Schwartz, and I'll see you in court!
Well, sir, I'm an excellent filer.
Glooph is not a letter, sir.
Thank you for being kind enough to lie. You see, I've been very lonely in my isolated tower of indecipherable speech. You're hired. Any questions?
Low overhead, m'boy. We pass the savings on to you.  But seriously, that's all covered in orientation.
I'll keep that in mind, sir.
More beet-spinach juice, my friend?
And what sort of business will this be? If you don't mind my asking.
Yes. Unfortunately it's bullshit. The real story of 7 1/2 is so evil that it could never be revealed to Americans raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors.
How dreary - to be - Somebody / How public - like a Frog / To tell one's name - the livelong June / To an admiring Bog!
No, really.
I just wanted to say hi.  Did you know I still don't know your name or where you work?
How about this, if I can guess your first name within three tries, you have to come out for a drink with me tonight.
I'm right?
Maxine.
Just.
Good. We'll sell tickets.
Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.
I'll protect you, Dollface.
Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now.
Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!
Ha ha ha!
Well, Don, I peeked in here, even though I know it's against floor policy. and I discovered that there's a little tiny door in here. Isn't it cute? It's almost like a little dolly's door. I wonder what its for.
Well that's perfect. My second choice. Ah, this is wonderful. Too good to be true! You see, I'm a sad man. Sad and fat and alone. Oh, I've tried all the diets, my friends. Lived for a year on nothing but imitation mayonnaise. Did it work? You be the judge. But Malkovich! King of New York! Man about town! Most eligible bachelor! Bon Vivant! The Schopenhauer of the 20th century! Thin man extraordinaire!
A scary dream?
You were stoned. Case closed. End of story. How hot is this babe?
You're crazy to let go of a chick who calls you Lotte. I tell you that as a friend.
All the better. Hey, Hot Lesbian Witches, next Geraldo, buddy boy. Ha ha ha.
Hi, uh.  Hi. I wanted to place an ad. Yes. "Ever want to be someone else?" No, that's the ad, but let's talk about you in a minute. "Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding..."
I have to see you. Can you call him and invite us over?
One hour.
Do you mind?
Oh, Dollface, it was just your passion for me taking hold.
Oh shut up.  Craig, darling are you in there?
No! Please!  Shut up, will you? We're trying to think here.  It is sort of like being a puppeteer. I like that about it.
It's okay, my sweet.
I'm nervous. Malkovich is fighting me hard today.
Aye. Speak then if ye must.
If I call them, and they come what on earth am I going to say to them.
The boys wouldn't have left if Halle were here.
YOUR FACE IS MINE.
WHY DID YOU LEAVE ME WHO AM YOU?
Mama told you - I'd give up my own life, every minute, every hour of it to take back one of your tears baby...My children my best thing. You my best thing!
Don't pay to complain.
At times. At other times I think she was...more. But who would know that better than you. I mean, you sure 'nough you her.
I don't. I have my own.
Yes sir
I will.
Yes ma'am..
I miss her.
Fine. But what would I do at night?
Oh yeah. They good. Can't say they ain't good. I wouldn't trade them for another pair, tell you that. But you come back in a few days - give me a chance to lead'em to it. All right?
Don't matter. First time I'll be late in nine years. No great trouble..Whatever goes on out there goes on with or without me showing up on time... don't matter...  The world is in this room, baby. This is all there is and all there needs to be.
Was over to Baby Suggs.
Ain't no new Negroes in this town I don't know about. What she look like? You sure that wasn't Denver?
Better ask Paul D.
Her who?
You was friends.
I run him off.
I told him...Showed him the newspaper. About Sethe. Read it to him. He left that very day.
He didn't know nothing. And nobody. Except her, from when they was at that place Baby Suggs was at.
Just me.
She was my best thing.
Uh-huh.
Shit.
Who're you working for?  Lebowski? Jackie Treehorn?
Fuck you.
Show me what you got.  Nihilist. Dipshit with a nine-toed woman.
Nothing.
Sir, this is a mortuary, not a rental house.
Yes sir.  It is our most modestly priced receptacle.
My rug.
And this guy peed on it.
Were you listening to the story, Donny?
So you have no frame of reference, Donny.  You're like a child who wanders in in the middle of a movie and wants to know--
Huh?
I told that kraut a fucking thousand times I don't roll on shabbas.
Shut the fuck up, Donny.  Not a bunch of fig-eaters with towels on their heads tryin' to find reverse on a Soviet tank.  This is not a worthy--
They won't hurt us, Donny.  These men are cowards.
Fuckin' A, man.  I got a rash. Fuckin' A, man.  I gotta tell ya Tony.
Uh-huh.
Hey, is this him with Nancy?
Are these.
I guess he's pretty, uh, racially pretty cool--
--and bowling.  I'll tell you the truth, Brandt, I don't remember most of it.--Jeez!  Fuck me!
Color?
And what do you do, sir?
Ahh, you know.  Strikes and gutters, ups and downs.
Uh-huh.  Well, I still jerk off manually.
But she hasn't run off, she's been--
Hey, relax man, I'm a brother shamus.
Jeffrey Lebowski.
Yes, they don't like hearing it and find it difficult to say.  Whereas without batting an eye a man will refer to his "dick" or his "rod" or his "Johnson".
Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski?
Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, yes, and proud we are of all of them. I asked my father about his withdrawal of a million dollars from the Foundation account and he told me about this "abduction", but I tell you it is preposterous.  This compulsive
I'm telling you, I got definitive evidence--
Beaver?  You mean vagina?--I mean, you know him?
Huh?  Autobahn.  A-u-t-o.  Their music is a sort of--ugh--techno-pop.
Is he pretending to be the abductor?
Delayed after-eff--
Larry Sellers, a high-school kid. Real fucking brat.
It's a complicated case, Maude. Lotta ins, lotta outs.  Fortunately I've been adhering to a pretty strict, uh, drug regimen to keep my mind, you know, limber.  I'm real fucking close to your father's money, real fucking close.  It's just--
Huh.  Jeez.  Well, so, did he--is that yoga?
Exactly.  What happened to your face? Did Jackie Treehorn do that as well?
What?
There's no fucking reason--here's my point, Dude--there's no fucking reason--
Huh?  No!  What the fuck are you talking--I'm not--we're talking about unchecked aggression here--
Walter, he peed on my rug--
Okay. That, uh.
First of all, Dude, you don't have an ex, secondly, it's a fucking show dog with fucking papers.  You can't board it.  It gets upset, its hair falls out.
You know Dude, I myself dabbled with pacifism at one point.  Not in Nam, of course--
Just, just take it easy, Walter.
Yeah?  Wavin' a gun around?!
I don't see any connection to Vietnam, Walter.
It's your roll.
My dirty undies.  Laundry, Dude. The whites.
What the fuck is going on there?
Easy, Dude.
Shutup, Walter!  Don't fucking say peep when I'm doing business here.
Yeah.  That's a great plan, Walter. That's fucking ingenious, if I understand it correctly.  That's a Swiss fucking watch.
Huh?
That's right, Dude, 1  % certain--
I told that fuck down at the league office-- who's in charge of scheduling?
C'mon Dude, eventually she'll get sick of her little game and, you know, wander back--
Saturday is shabbas.  Jewish day of rest.  Means I don't work, I don't drive a car, I don't fucking ride in a car, I don't handle money, I don't turn on the oven, and I sure as shit don't fucking roll!
And what do they got, Dude?  My dirty undies.  My fucking whites--Say, where is  the car?
Well, certainly that's a possibility, Dude--
The nail polish, Walter.
But Walter--
What about the toe?
All right, I'm leaving.  I'm sorry ma'am.
Now that is ridiculous, Dude.  No one is going to cut your dick off.
Dude--
The bulk of the series.
Not exactly a lightweight.
Yeah, go figure.  Well we'll go out there after the, uh, the.
Look, man, did you--
Just ask him if he--ask him about the car, man!
I can't drive, Dude, it's erev shabbas.
Yeah?  What do you think happens when you get divorced?  You turn in your library card?  Get a new driver's license?  Stop being Jewish?
He can't walk, Walter!
Then what's...
Walter--
You're a fuck, Walter!
You don't go out and make a living dressed like that in the middle of a weekday.
WHAT?!
Where's the money, Lebowski?
Walter!
I came all the way down here same as you did.  Keep from gettin' killed. Happened to see those jarheads beatin' on a good collar--  Habla Ingles, Tomas?
Someday.
They tell bedtime stories about you. Blade the big, bad boogie-man.  Frankly, I'm disappointed.  That you were willing to come along so easily, I mean.  Without any assurances.
You're missing the point.  Their vampire victims don't die.  They turn.  They become carriers.  If the Reapers continue unchecked, there could be thousands of them before the month is over.  Do the math.
What the hell are you doing, Blade?
Nothing.
From the surveillance footage in the bloodbank.  He was one of the guard's Nomak attacked.
Like cancer with a purpose.
You don't have to hunt to do it.
I don't think so.
For what?
If that's true, then why'd you save me?
Did you think I wouldn't?
You put a bullet in my brain.  Wouldn't expect anything else.
I don't like it.
I'll show you.
Where the hell have you been?
Look, I care about the humans who are dying, not you, got it?
I don't know about this, man --
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.  Isn't that how the saying goes?
Ain't no thing but a chicken wing, buttercup.
Yeah, but you fangs can see in the dark. What am I supposed to do?
Thiavolos, as we used to say in Greece. The Devil.  Pure Thirst.  Nothing more. He was born a vampire, but he is an anomaly.  Like you.  Unlike the rest of us, however, he feeds on not just humans, but vampires as well.
Fuck yeah.  Whole package'll crank this betty up another three-hundred horsepower.
Look, what's your problem?
Our operation?!  Our operation?!  I built this operation, you fucking turd stain.
Blade doesn't talk about the old days much.
You little shit.  When did they get to you?
I don't buy it.
You're blind --
But I just got here --
Do it. You'll be dead before you can file the complaint.
He didn't. Get over it.
What do you see here?
Look closer.
There are worse things than vampires out there.
We've got a good arrangement, that's all. Whistler makes the weapons, I use them, the vampires die -- end of story.
I don't know. I woke up just before you did --
For them. But for me --
There's only one alternative to the serum.
Listen to your father, Jason. It's going to be a better world.
It's not a joke. I've got the stiff sitting in the morgue right now -- look, just come up and see him, okay? Five minutes, that's all I ask.
A few thousand scattered about the globe. In the past, we've had to restrict our numbers for fear of discovery. That won't be necessary after tonight.
That's right. The answers were there all along, of course, scribbled down in the forgotten languages of my kind. Waiting for someone with the patience to decipher them. My elders were foolish enough to dismiss them as wives tales. But I knew better.  Imagine my surprise when Blade turned out to be the key which would set that force free.
You.
He killed them?
--which she may have--
I don't...I don't understand them myself.
--bad boys, mean boys, <u>cowardly</u> boys--just like Domini.
Closer. Lift the lid and look-- it hurts.
I'm not a witch, you're all crazy!
Mrs. Leavitt--
Down or off--you're giving me a migraine.
--it's called "morning sickness," asshole--
So whoever built this--
Domini. Domini Von Teer.
--whatever; that's her.
Like how weirded-out you are with this pregnancy thing.
--fine, later, fine.
You said the name "James."
--scared the living shit out of us.
I want to see the tapes.
No idea. But if that's all we've got left--
--bullshit!
No.
<u>Before</u> 5:00--
--Christ, they find out I let you have it for the weekend--
You have to go.
Sometimes.
--hunch. Just sort've saw 'em there.
Well, please keep me fucking informed!
What? That made her lose the baby?
Who do you know who can? Where do we go?
If I could do that, I'd be at the goddamn racetrack, not here.
--go!
Oh, for chrissake, she was an actor.
Why does everyone here but me have have a gigantic stick up their ass?
Ask me what I don't have.
Yeah?
Not a great idea. Especially 'cross the street.
--Cotter: shut up.
I got the tape enhanced--and I managed to sleaze a photo blow-up. Jesus, he's gonna kill me when he finds out about the camera.
--anywhere, anywhere, all up and live, all the time--fucking owl--
Heather, does that look like Domini there?
Next time try putting on shoes--
No one ever comes here.
What?
--turn the camera off--
I am.
--now there.
--great: we can watch Domini sleep for hours--or, shit, maybe if we stay at it for a couple of days, maybe a deer'll dash by!
No one's been in or out since you left. Would've heard the dogs.
What're you nuts--
At least you still have the tapes.
No. I don't think so.
--and we brought it back with us!
Hmm? I dunno. Chafing from the backpack, something.
Then I have no idea.
Still working on it.
No. Elly Kedward's not the problem here, I don't think. She was just a good old-fashioned white witch--
....I don't know.
It touched me, don't you see it now?
--she wasn't a witch--we embrace nature, not evil--
They never burned witches in this country, they hanged them.
--it's not a could've--there <u>was</u>, Nick. And it fucked up Anna, and did something to Domini, and it caused my father to die, and it's here <u>with</u> us in this place <u>now</u>. And I don't have one single idea in hell what's going to happen next, just that it's going to happen to one of us. And then the other. And then the other. It's going to get into our <u>brains</u>.
Don't! You're making me lose my grip.
Or a blood blister--or a bruise.
Check the monitor, she's <u>fine</u>.
Anna--
There are <u>other</u> explanations! She is not the goddamn witch, that's insane!
Yes! I need to speak to Sheriff Von Teer.
No, I--
Sort of...
Your husband.
I just gotta see a guy.
You wouldn't be putting me out.
Door's locked. Nothing there.
I said, Marty, how come you're anal and I gotta go to the psychiatrist?
I don't know. I better get off now.
You're bad.
I didn't think I could sleep. I'm surprised you could. Are you all right?
What the hell happened, Ray?
What do you want to know?
About ten years.
I reckon I can hear him...  ...Room rate's eight sixty-six a day plus sales tax, plus extra for the TV option.
I'll figure something out... How come you offered to drive me in this mess?
No.
What do you mean...
How long did you watch her?
It's, uh... it's in reference to that gentleman and my wife. The more I think about it the more irritated I get.
Listen, I'm not--this isn't a joke here.
Ya catch any fish?
Ya catch any fish?
...What kind of fish?
Got something to show me first?
Right.
You we telling me about the Ring of Fire.
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
Darling, where are the glasses?. Oh. here they are.
Okay.
Yeah.
Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
Then, shut up!
Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.
Shut up. Gimme your lipstick.  . Hey, pretty, pretty.
Jeffrey nothing.
Well.
I . I don't know.
Nothing. Are you alright?
Do you know?
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from but. I like you.
Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. you like me, huh?
. or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
Hello.
I'm sorry .maybe I better go Dorothy.
I sure don't hate you.
Beeeee careful.
Do you love me?
If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell. it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
Okay Frank.
I don't really know much but bits and pieces . I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear. there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
No. this has been going on for some time . several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body. only parts.
Yeah. It's close by. that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
Where are they?
Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
Yeah. Good bye.
Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.
You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. a few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?
Alright.
Yeah. let's get outta here. What happened?
Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
Leave it in the front of your house for me. okay?
He got a little jealous.
No way. I'm about to blow up.
. OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. this is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. they have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. the ears were for her a warning to stay alive. there is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". you saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.
. Actually. I've been in twice.
I will.  I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now. the only trouble is. what does this prove?
Oh yeah?
I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
I can't dance fast.
Dorothy Vallens?
OK. Let's get her over to your father's.
Go ahead!
Do you want the car?
Alright.
Of course, Jeffrey.
Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
Sure thing. please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
Yeah, nice meetin' yuh.
Um-hmm.
That's impossible.  We can't be up and running.  Who's distributing?
No.  I have the space.  I figured it out.  This is what I want to do.
Mama, vos sos bien antigua.  Como lo va a matar con un picahielo.  Eso era en su tiempo, estamos casi ya en los ochenta. El lo va a meter un tiro, lo va a volar, le va a hechar un hijueputa carro encima.
You'll see for yourself.
You happy, baby?
I'm telling you, Derek, it will sell.
Relax, baby.  We're going to wind up like us.
Baby, you didn't have to come.
Lawyer says he can plead it down to five years.  I'll serve two.
Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.
Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.
I'm doing sixty years at Otisville, no chance of parole.  Even if they cut my sentence in half I'll be seventy-three years old.  That's some fucking deal.  I don't know if the parole board, the judge, the pope or Jesus Christ himself can get me out of here.  I have a really bad record, I'm not sure what's going to happen.
It's a lousy fifteen kilos.  I piss fifteen kilos.
You're a fucking amateur!
Excuse me?
I see.  How much?
We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop?
Goodness is right.  If you do the math, that's over thirty grand a week profit. I want you to be my partner on this, Derek.  Fifty-fifty.  That's fifteen thousand a week for you, my friend.  In your pocket, free and clear.
Barbara and me.  No one else.
You guys are such babies.  You want to go home, go.  Me, I'm not going to stop until I find the fucking motherlode.
Yeah.  She told me.
Oh hey, one more thing?
Nothing.  Just a little project.
And that's wholesale.  Cut it a few times and retail, you're looking at two, three-hundred thousand.
Now do you see what I am saying?
I don't know.  A hundred, hundred and fifty.  How many miles is it from Colombia to Miami?
It is bad.  It's chump change.  We might as well be hauling suitcases across the border.  We're getting screwed.
What is it, George?  Because I have to get home.  I've got a parole officer waiting for me.
We're half a million off.
Try the closet.
You're a lucky man, Diego.
No more brothers, Diego.
You went behind my back and you cut me out.
George, don't be so emotional.  This is business.  Besides, I can't kill you, you are my brother.
Coke.
Today.
Yes, Barbara.  She was very pretty.
You mean the drug money?  Yes, I got it.
I've seen those in magazines.  They're not cheap.
Oh, I see.
Actually, it was three.
Un sapo?
With all respect, Padrino.  Diego is my partner.  I do not do business without him.
Yes, sir.  As much as you can give me.
You're saying life will take care of Diego?
I get it.   I'm really pissed, Pablo. You know the DEA knows about Norman's Cay.  For Chrissakes, Diego worships Adolf Hitler and John Lennon, that's fucked up!
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?  You and me, Pablo?  Are we good?
That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
Alright.  You want me to get your old job back?  Because I could, you know, I could put in that word.
Yeah, Dad.  I'm happy right now.
I'll tell her.
What about him?
The set-up is wrong.  We're doing all the legwork, and at the end of the day, we're still paying retail.  We're getting middled.
Oh fucking relax.  Let your hair down for once.  It's your fucking birthday, for Chrissakes.  You're such a fucking pussy.  I swear to G-d, I married this big time drug dealer and wound up with the maid.
Yeah, well.  I'm working on that.  I've got something going.
I know.  Well, that's all I really wanted to say.  So, okay, then.
Yeah.  I'm fine.  I'm good.
Is she here?  George, Kristina hates you.  You fucked her over one too many times.  And I'm not here to socialize. Did you hear about Diego?
Well, I got a call from Pablo.  He said this thing with Diego is a disaster. He's giving up lab locations, names, bank accounts, he was very pissed off. Pablo said to take him down.  His exact words were "Fuck Diego."
You can call me Dad if you want.
You mean, like a trip?
Yeah.
No.  I just kind of like the sound of it.
Where are you going?
You know I can't.  Mom will never let me go.
Okay, George.
We'll do that tomorrow, okay?  It's lockdown time.
Yes, I do.
Jesus, George, fifteen percent.  That's an extra two-hundred large.
What if I brought you, let's say, fifty thousand dollars?  Would that eliminate some of your concerns?
G-d, I'm stoned.  I'm stoned.  I'm really...
Shit, yeah.  Do you know how much money I could make if I had this stuff back east?
Who speaks Spanish?
Fuck yeah.  I never seen nothing like it.  I'm fucking wasted.
Cheer up, man.  Half this money is ours. We're fucking rich.
You know, he's got a point.  We're fucking Americans.  We stick out like sore thumbs.
The strike is a success; but ...
The UN is far away, dear sir. It is easier to make oneself heard with bombs. If I were in their place, I would use bombs.
Dien Bien Phu?
And those who explode bombs in public places, do they perhaps respect the law? When you asked that question to Ben M'Hidi, remember what he said? No, gentlemen, believe me, it is a vicious circle. And we could discuss the problem for hours without reaching any conclusions. Because the problem does not lie here. The problem is: the NLF wants us to leave Algeria and we want to remain. Now, it seems to me that, despite varying shades of opinion, you all agree that we must remain. When the rebellion first began, there were not even shades of opinion. All the newspapers, even the left-wing ones wanted the rebellion suppressed. And we were sent here for this very reason. And we are neither madmen nor sadists, gentlemen. Those who call us fascists today, forget the contribution that many of us made to the Resistance. Those who call us Nazis, do not know that among us there are survivors of Dachau and Buchenwald. We are soldiers and our only duty is to win. Therefore, to be precise, I would now like to ask you a question: Should France remain in Algeria? If you answer "yes," then you must accept all the necessary consequences.
Sid Ahmed.
Sail.
Second district ...
Don't move, Hacene.
Then don't complain.
Because we aren't ready yet for the French. Before attacking, we must have safe places from which to depart and find refuge. Of course, there is the Casbah. But even the Casbah isn't safe yet. There are too many drunks, pushers, whores, addicts, spies ... people who talk too much ... people who are ready to sell themselves, undecided people. We must either convince them or eliminate them. We must think of ourselves first. We must clean out the Casbah first. Only then will we be able to deal with the French. Do you understand, Ali?
Let's try ...
It's a question of habit ...
But Kader told me that you weren't in favor of the strike.
Why?
That's true ... Wars aren't won with terrorism, neither wars nor revolutions. Terrorism is a beginning but afterward, all the people must act ... This is the reason for the strike, and its necessity: to mobilize all Algerians, count them and measure their strength ...
Good evening, sir.
Of course I am.
Yes ... But let me first see you.
Why?
Right now.  Guess who's been buying Coke from him for the last five and half years?
You think the D.A.'s gonna file on Joanne?
Did I say it was a natural death?
Then you can go.
Cause?
We know Marsh had a head cold.   We found cocaine mixed with water in a nasal spray container on the nightstand.  The coke would contract the nasal membrane the same as any decongestant, but for a much shorter time.  He'd keep using more and more -- never knowing what he was taking.
We found a high concentration of cocaine in his blood.
It would be the same as shooting a gun at him.
Sex.
No -- never.
Take your pole out of the water, Frank.  The fish ain't biting today.
The M.E.'s report stated that Marsh's nasal membranes showed no sign of prior cocaine use.  Without the nasal spray we would have still treated it as a poisoning.  We would have looked for motive and the trail would have still led back to her.
We're going all the way on this one, Frank.  Tell your client she has until the prelim to cop a plea for murder two -- fifteen to twenty five.
Aren't they all?
I was just about to make my point, Your Honor.
I'm just curious to see if Mr. Troxell reconstructed anything else.
Really?  What does an attorney speak to his client about at her house until three o'clock in the morning?
Your Honor, Mr. Roston lived with the defendant for many months.  I feel that his opinion is valid in substantiating the character of the Miss Lawson.
I'll rephrase the question.  Mr. Roston isn't it true you are bisexual?
Your Honor, I'm trying to establish a pattern in Dr. Paley's behavior with women.
A little after eleven.
Rebecca Lawson.
Yes.
Yeah.
His Secretary.  Joanne Braslow.
No.  She stopped by to pick up some papers.
Intense.
It was wild.  She was constantly trying to get me more and more worked up -- kinky things.  I tried to satisfy her the best I could, but it was difficult in my condition.
I had a bad heart.
She left me.
I couldn't help myself.  You get lost inside a women like her.  It was like a drug.  It was the best sex I ever had.
We stopped seeing each other.
She said that she was working on a novel and she wanted to know what kinds of drugs would be harmful to someone with a bad heart.
Cocaine.
No.
And the argument was about the fact that you wanted to be romantically involved and she did not.
And after that didn't you continuously harass Miss Lawson?
No -- she asked me about cocaine.
That's all Dr. Paley.
No.
Yes.
Chinese peony root.
One last question, Doctor.  If someone didn't know better, would it be easy to mistake the peony root for cocaine?
Then -- those are not your own words?
I'm a nurse.  I used to work at Roseburg Memorial Hospital.  Dr. Paley's on staff there.
I don't know.  It's incredible to think that anyone could be capable of doing that -- but if anyone could it would be Rebecca.
You've tried it?  Isn't it true that you've been in and out of Rehab centers for the last four years?
You don't like her because you were involved with Mr. Marsh before she came along.  Isn't that true?
You resented the fact that she told you what to do in Mr. Marsh's house?
Yes.
Yes.
There's an item you picked up that's marked.  Will you read it?
You see that's what bothers me.  No other bottle of nasal spray was found in the house.  The police looked. There was only the one bottle.  But you say you didn't arrive until after Mr. Marsh was dead -- yet we know he was using the nasal spray prior to his death.  How do you think it got there?
No!  Why would I want to kill him?
What do you think I've got?  A gun? Maybe I'm gonna kill you too.  Maybe I'll blow your head off right now.
And she left shortly after that?
There are no charges against you. I'm here to decide if I'm going to represent you should that occur.  Did you kill him?
I don't know.  That's why I'm asking you.
Not a very good one I'm afraid.
We're not animals.
I was at a cocktail party.  Very trendy.  Andrew was in Chicago on business.  He had broken his wrist the week before and was wearing it in a sling.  He looked so helpless.
I know.
Oh -- Well, they're different.
It's not my taste.
Great.  I'll see you at the office at nine.
It's okay.
Is that what you think I was thinking?
Of course.
Tonight we open new doors.
Are you scared?
Fuck him!  He tried to shatter mine.
We've already got press arriving from over the country and she hasn't even been charged yet. Cardenas wants to see her in his office tomorrow at ten.  I'd like you to go with her.
She's waiting in the conference room.
She allegedly humped him to death?
Yeah.
Really?
Attractive.  Bright.  Distant. Charming when she wants to be.
Yes.
Because I go to trial in seven weeks. I've got a lot of preparing to do.
Yeah -- fine.  Excuse me.  I'll be right back.
Where have you been?
Charlie called at eleven thirty looking for you.  You were with her, weren't you?
Maybe it would be a good idea if you just took Michael.
We can't pretend this isn't happening.
Not even if they're a dork.  You should go by and see how he's feeling.
I nearly died when we split the bill.
Oh Jesus.
Doesn't matter. Move on.
Mr. Peterson, are you sure mama wrote all this?
Aw, Betty.
He's not coming.
Well, there's a problem.
Well, I don't care if it's legal or not, we're not cremating her and throwing her all over some bridge where we can't even go visit her because she's going to be blown all over the place like an ashtray.
Michael.
That would be some trick. He's already dead. That's what this other letter is.  From his attorney. He left most of his things to mama and requested...
'82.
Don't talk to me like that. She was my mother for Christsakes. And now I find out she was... She was a --!
Well, what am I supposed to think?
Yeah. But I thought she died.
What gets me is I'm 46 years old. I've been in this crummy fucking marriage -
Hi. I made some brown betty. I sent Floyd off to town with the boy. I said -  "Floyd, I'm going to visit my girlfriend and spend the afternoon and that's all there is to it. He said who's going to make lunch? I said I'm taking a sick day. Eat at the dinner." Isn't that hilarious?  He didn't dare raise an eyebrow -- I don't even want to tell you how late he was out last night with those good for nothings from the Sandford ranch. I am so sorry, honey, I let two days pass before I came by, but with the boy home the time just escapes me. Have you heard from Richard? How's the fair? God, it's hot.
Oh, honey. I'm so sorry. But you've got to be grateful for even feeling the little you've be given. Believe me. Go to him. Don't let him leave without these new precious hours you've got left. And if you need anyone to cry on, you know where I am.
Maybe it's because I live here.
You don't look like a native, if you don't mind my saying so.
Yeah. Excuse me a sec.
Want another cigarette?
Must be nice having kids.
Clean?
Much.
Sure. Men cook. We don't all eat bananas with our feet, ya know.
She starts sniffing me.
We got engaged.
I'm kind of obsessed by it, actually.
No. It's all right. I just meant, it might be a little dull for you, telling all this to some housewife in the middle of nowhere.
No, you rub it on you. I have some in the truck. Don't go away.
You get used to it.
Umm, I don't know. I can look it up.
Yes.
No.
That's not what you're saying. I know it's not the same. What you're saying is, it's not as good. Or it's not as normal or proper.
I'm a little sick of this American Family Ethic everyone seems to be hypnotized by in this country. I guess you think I'm just some poor displaced soul doomed to roam the earth without a self-cleaning oven and home movie.
Do you want to leave your husband?
Yeah. See you later.
Are you hungry?
What?
I sat outside and had coffee.
No, I don't mind.
I had a temper.
Just that it's been a perfect day and that I'd like to skip my fancy dessert and go home after this.
You're right, you know. We don't have much time.
Long day. Go to sleep.
No.
Well, I just want to know the procedure. I don't want to upset your routine. Do you want any jam?
Well, what is this?
Gee, I don't know. I guess I'm not cut out to be a World Citizen who experiences everything and nothing at the same time.
I know you! What can this possibly mean to anyone who doesn't "need" meaning -  "Who goes with the Mystery" -- who pretends he isn't scared to death.
Fine. More eggs or should we just fuck on the linoleum one last time?
No one's asking you to!
Then he can move! People move!
But now that you have it -
I CAN'T SAY GOODBYE YET! We'll leave it for now. We're not saying goodbye. We're not making any decision. Maybe you'll change your mind. Maybe we'll accidentally run into each other and ... and you'll change your mind.
I can't sleep.
I'm not sick, Richard. I'm just not tired, now go back to sleep before you're up for the whole night too!
Frannie.
Nah.
Isn't that nice? You should bring her home to meet us!
What happened?
Well, close the fucking door by all means.  But don't expect me to go down there and do it.
Go for it.
I believe in you guys.  You are the real shit.  And you know it.  Now I'm putting everything I got into this cuz I think we can make it happen, but you gotta put a little in too.  Now all I"m asking is that everybody do their part.  We'll move some shit in, and take shifts, or all crash together here --
Spooked?
Whatever, let's just get the hellout of here.
Climb out to where?
Or just Hell-adjacent...
Dad, the man has been lying to us for a hundred years.  I mean, where is my forty acres and a mule?
Unh-unh, little brother.  I got a natural high.  A supernatural high.
What it will be.
Just try it.
Hush, baby.
They get about twelve and a half minutes. Tops.
Nothing but net?  Could be a swish.  Or a muthafucking air ball.
I don't need to hear the deal.  I don't need any partners.  I don't need new product.  And I sure as hell don't need this motherfucker's 'mattie in my face.
Since we was just grasshoppers...
Then fuck it!!!
I don't want you meeting around that house.  You stay away from those kids. And away from that dog.
You said the vision, the images.  They're just that.  Just pictures.  They can't hurt you.  That's what you always said.
All the more reason I should be here.
You said bad things hurt places.  So maybe good things heal them.  Good things are happening here.  Maybe for the first time ever.  And maybe that's all it takes.
Who?  Who is he?  What is he?
But how do you know?  Maybe he just wanted to see us?  And now he's gone again.  And you've all killed my father for the second time.
Aren't you gonna do something about it?
That place is already bad luck.
Maybe.  But there's an invisible wall, a fabric that kinda keeps things separate.
Or the living fall in.  Who knows.
It's...it's a bad neighborhood.  As you can see now.
That's the past.  It's dead.
I didn't sell it.
You better hope not.  Cause it's like they say, four can keep a secret, if three are dead.
That's it.  Get out.  Now!
I ain't killed nobody.  Shall I rack 'em?  Play a game, Lupe?
I'm on my way home.  Can you handle it yourself?
But --
No more thoughts from your asses.  Or I will burn your asses and snort the ashes. Hear me?
Look, you guys want to play college radio, high school reunions, and some fool's club once a week for the rest of your lives, that's cool.  But I think we can do better.
I am the future.  I am all colors.  All races.  All creeds.  I am the melting pot.  I am the tossed salad.  I am post racial.
That building?
Should I?
Then your father's a dead man and Jimmy Bones is gonna be around a long time.
How could that be?  The box was packed!
Evidence of what?
No, Caesar, gimme the gun.
No!
I can't.  I can't.
No shit.  Bianchinni hired you?  You know he's a good friend of mine. |Family, really.
What are you talking about?
It was him.  I'm positive.
Caesar, I know Johnnie.  It was him. I screamed when I saw him.  I couldn't believe I missed them.  I knew you were going to be upset so I thought I'd apologize and give Gino the Scotch.  I honked a couple of times but he didn't stop.
The hell I can't!
Don't tell him --
You betrayed me!
You're blowing your only chance. Act like I'm Gino.
Good boy.
What are you going to do, V?  Shoot me?  Kill me in cold blood?  I don't think so.  I'll tell you why.  If you had it in you to pull that trigger, you would have done it a long time ago.  If I was you, I would have killed me the minute I brought the money home.  But you didn't and I know why, because you don't want to kill me.  Do you, V?  Do you? No, I know you don't.
Oh, right.
Sure.
Either pull the trigger or get that thing out of my face.
Me?  Why?
Oh Christ, the phone ...  That was a fucking stupid thing to do, wasn't it?
Sure, Cease.  They make us do stupid things, don't they.
Oh yeah.  Violet!
This is the police, ma'am.
Good guess.
My pleasure ...  but to be honest, I did have a slightly ulterior motive here.  I was wondering if I could ask a small favor?
He said you lost something.
I told Bianchinni I would take a look.  Is it that sink?
Sure.
Why?
Basically.
Almost five years.
If there is one thing I can't stand about sleeping with women, it's all the fucking mind reading.
I know!  You can't understand, because we're different, Violet.  We're different.
Let me guess.  This is where you tell me that what matters is on the inside.  That inside you, there is a little dyke just like me?
What the fuck was it?
I suppose he just wants to watch.
Even though he knew about you?
How much money?
Good.
Marzzone?  As in Angelo Marzzone, head of the Marzzone family?
Not much, really.  Caesar was nervous, kept cleaning the apartment.  |The first time, he picked out the dress he wanted me to wear.
Scotch, Glenlivet.  I remember that Caesar made a huge deal about it.
The plane is in at seven, so I'd say about eight.
An accident.
If he does ...
Every job like this has moments where things don't go so well and everyone starts thinking about their own ass. It's in those moments that everything comes together or falls apart.
Hey.
I'm here, aren't I?
You are as radiant as ever, Violet.
Pop?
Caesar?  What the fuck time is it?
Violet, it's Gino and Johnnie.  They were in a car accident.
Violet?
I'm assuming we're exploring that possibility.
I'm not asking.
Our last sighting was forty-eight hours ago.  Even if they stayed in the car, the grid is huge.  This is it.  He's trained -- conditioned -- they're built to disappear.  You give him another day to run and we may never find him.
We're in the shitter, man!  Pick your poison.  Maybe he's in there to finish the job.  Maybe he's working for Wombosi.  Maybe they want to go on TV together.  Every possibility sucks -- we've got to move!
...it's a problem...
...or in a car...when it's dark...something with the headlights...  ...pills, right?  Treadstone had those pills...
MPG Capital.
I know who sent you.  I don't know why.  I learned many, many things from the CIA.  <u>Many</u> things.  I learned the way they think.  Was the bomb on my boat supposed to go off or not?
I don't know.
Right.
Yes, sir...  How can I help you?
One moment, sir.
I hadn't heard.
I want to go home.
<u>No</u>.  No, that was too easy --
Then I'll find another ride.
I'm sorry.  Really.  What do you want me to do?

There was a gun.  Who has a safe deposit box with a gun and all this money and all these passports?
I don't remember any of this.
All this stuff -- it's all about boats.  I think I'm in the shipping business.
Open it --  -- do it -- what's he got in there?
-- do what? -- what are you doing? -- he's got my picture --  -- he's -- my God -- look at him -- he's bleeding to death -- my picture -- look! -- he was trying to kill us! -- omigod --
No.
You stay -- if you want, you stay -- it's okay -- it's better -- maybe it's better -- I don't know --  But I can't stay here.  <u>I can't</u>.
-- forget it --
Who paid the bill?
I don't know.
You could do that?
I'm gonna find the end of this.  I can't protect you.
This your store?
-- here we go -- I found it --
I'm sorry.
You only know that because I told you!  Ask the case officer -- find his name -- it's on the papers -- I told him all this myself! --
xxxxxx
-- he accessed the account --
-- we're evacuating the building --
-- he's running from the cops, he's got a bag filled with God knows what, he's in the building and I don't know where! --
Where am I?
I haven't got an emergency. Get out of here.
Machines don't fix themselves.
He's tampered with it, Dowser.
... get to it.
What do I have to do.
It's reply paid.
You don't have to sing it.
I'm waiting for my daddy.
Bad sportsmanship. A ruthless minority of people seems to have forgotten certain good old fashioned virtues. They just can't stand seeing the other fellow win. If these people would just play the game, instead of standing on the touch line heckling -
On yes. Our morale is much higher than theirs, we're fielding all their strokes, running a lot of them out, and pretty consistently knocking them for six. I'd say they're nearly out of the game.
Well, I ...
I assure you, Sam, I'm doing everything within my power. But the rules of the game are laid down, and we all have to play by them - even me.
Sam, if you've been going out there and playing a straight bat, all the way down the line, you've got absolutely nothing to worry about.
SAM! What a surprise!
Am I?
Not much.
No, no, I don't. I'm just beginning Honestly. Sorry, carry on.
I'm sure you have
Yes. I'm impressed.
You're the only person I can trust.
There's no procedure for that until she's been arrested.
I'm sorry, Sam, I'm afraid this whole case has become much more complicated since last we talked.
There are no coincidences, Sam. Everything's connected, all along the line. Cause and effect. That's the beauty of it. Our job is to trace the connections and reveal them.  This whole Buttle/Tuttle confusion was obviously planned from the inside. Bye bye.
Sam - we've always been close, haven't we?
Shut up!
Ah.
Oh.
I don't want to hear about your fucking dreams!
It's my fucking life.
I didn't run away. I left the flat.
Well, no system is.
Well, terrorists of course.
What?
Who will?
Get away!
Let go! We've got to stop!
Oh God! What have we done?
It wasn't supposed to happen like this.
"And your children all gone."
I saved you from the lorry and you're not very special.
Expediting has put in for electrical procedures in respect of Buttle, Archibald, shoe repair operative, but Security has invoiced Admin for Tuttle, Archibald, heating engineer
The refund for Tuttle!
We've got to get rid of it! There's been a balls-up somewhere, and when the music stops they'll jump on whoever's holding the cheque!
Well, that's it! I may as well go and hang myself! This sort of thing couldn't have happened before the stupid seventh tier reorganization! That was Simmons doing! And he and Jeffries always sit together at lunch! The bastards!  Ow!  Perhaps we can lose it ... behind the filing cabinet ... or destroy it ... burn it ... eat it ...
Here.
What's the matter?
Yes.  NO! You can't! You've only just turned it down!
I'll bring it back in ten minutes.
You must be joking -  When there's a woman involved - there's no stopping me. Now, let me have that sheet.
You haven't switched it on.
No you're not. Jack Lint is a lesson to you - he never had your brains but he's got the ambition. You haven't got the ambition but luckily you've got me. And Mr Helpmann. Mr Helpmann was very close -
Yes he is - he wants to talk to you.
Mistake?
Er ... I assure you Mrs Buttle, the Ministry is always very scrupulous about following up and eradicating error. If you have any complaints which you'd like to make, I'd be more than happy to send you the appropriate forms.
Thirtieth floor, sir. You're expected.
Numero, trois.
What is it?
Who fixed your ducts?
... but, with all the new rules and regulations ... unncgh, c'mon, c'mon ... they can't get decent staff any more ... so ... they tend to turn a blind eye ... as long as I'm careful.  ... Mind you, if ever they could prove I'd been working on their equipment ... well, that's a different matter ... up a bit with the torch, sir.
It's okay. I'll just get my things out of the locker.
You know they won't do it. It's up to you. You gotta be strong.
No ...
What if there is no tomorrow?
Never. No cigarettes, no drugs, no booze.
Got a beer?
I should be going. I just quit.
What?
I guess there's always a chance.
It's okay. They're prescription.  Works better with a little whiskey.
Yes.
Yes.
Our Lady of Misery.
He's working a double shift.
I was just going to get some food. Pizza. Maybe we could.
Look, I'm sorry, but it's important to me. I mean, a week ago I was wishing he was dead. And now I want hear his voice again, just once more-- you know what I mean?
You remember that pizza place, Joe's on Tenth Street maybe fifteen years ago?  When you ordered a pie it came with a little plastic madonna in the middle?
Wow, you musta seen some things, huh? What's the worst thing you ever seen?
I better go check on my father. Thanks for the pizza. I owe you one. Maybe when he gets better, you know, when we're done with all this.
I'm all right. I just can't stand to see people tied up.  I'm in the waiting room for hours, listening to Noel screaming. The only reason he's screaming is 'cause he's tied up.
Nothing's going to happen. I'll come with you.
You asked me not to come.
Fifteen minutes.
It'll be a while before he's up and running again.
No, the city doesn't discriminate. It gets everybody.
She's no whore, Marcus.
What look?
We just saved a little baby boy. Think of it that way.
I hate pronouncing people dead over the phone.  Better, huh? They're fixed and dilated. He's plant food.
A medical miracle.
Jesus Christ. Nurse Crupp!  Anybody else hurt?
Crazy fucker.
Come on, Frank. There's blood spilling in the streets.
Ten-four. El Toro de Oro. Blast off.
Look out!
C'mon, Tom. The city's burning.
I've taken that into consideration.
Better bring it all.
You want some bum in the bus terminal? We'll wait for a real call.
Who with?
Why?
You need a reason, Frank. You don't just go around breaking people's windows. That's anarchy.
He's crazy. He can't help it.
Okay, whatta I do?
Someone's gonna die someday causa that bum, going to have a cardiac and the only medics will be taking care of Mr. Oh.
Relax, will you.
One more time!
No way!
You're almost there, you can do it -- can do -- can do.
Yeah.
Why don't you lead?  I'll just follow the flurry you cause.
I'm starting to... We may do the capitols of the states.
The pointers were great.  I'll study the tape.
Can I ask you something?  You only had one crew on the date rape piece, right?
No.  I don't know how much fun it will be when Martin Klein and Ernie have to drop off their credentials with the security guard.
No, I liked the way it made me sound. Okay.  Be good.  So long.
Congratulations on history's longest winning streak.
Office Bimbo.  No, I'm sorry.
A half hour in the lobby.
No.  It makes me nervous to think about it.  Let's do this.
This conversation is not worthy of you.
Call if you get weird.
Eleven and a half.
If we don't get to their camp soon, we won't be able to tape the supplies coming in.
You spend too much time -- much too much worrying about that crap...  Oh good.
We can cut back at the end.
Thanks.  The F-14 is one of the most difficult planes to master.  Oh, you call them 'Tomcats' and in the 70's the first crop had a number of crashes.
Could you at least pretend that this is an awkward situation for you -- me showing up while you're getting ready for a date.
As good as humanly possible.
Define your terms.
No, nice ones worried that I was having a heart attack.
No.  You know that I'm not.
Yes, yes.  I know.  Right.  And if it had gone well for me tonight, maybe I'd be keeping quiet about all this...I grant you everything but give me this...he does personify everything you've been fighting against...And I'm in love with you.  How do you like that? -- I buried the lead.
Stop.  Ernie thought I was good too -- he couldn't help.  My agent has a hot prospect -- the number two station in Portland.  The general manager says he wants to be every bit as good as the networks.  Personally, I think he should aim higher.
I just want to sit here longer, I mean the feeling is powerful -- why's that?
In other times, for other purposes, there might be a band and bunting here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's return from war.  He...
Wipe me out?
Please prepare carefully.  This couldn't come at a better time.
I understand.  I'll go with you.
Move away from me.
Almost immediately.
Bill...This is hard on all of us and it's no time for compliments. But I think it's extraordinary of you to come down here for this.
I'll speak to you soon
I'll never tell.
No, I'm not.  I'm the fourth. Joan Richmond.  Pauline Fredericks got that credit once on a U.N. special and there's Susan Zirinsky.
We could...
Right there, Bobbie.
Yes, it's true.  They're going to make it public Wednesday but isn't it a big deal for you to have it a day and a half early?
My roommate's very social -- somebody from Justice was over and...I always hear things before they happen.  Hey, and from now on, so do you.
Thanks a lot, Buddy.
I just have two more pen pals and then I'm done.
No.  Not even you.
No, it's awful.  Oh my, it's awful.
I just wanted to tell you  how great you were.  My name's Tom Grunick.
That actually goes on...
'Really a lot appreciate it...'
Excited.
Well, I thought I'd check if all of you were still here.  I'll just go in and join the gang and you two go on.
Do I have to stand here in the middle and meet them all?
Oh, good.
You just can't stop editing me. Huh?
Good...Another is you're trying to make it all about sex and heat and nothing else.
It's not that it's hard.  I just want you to give me a minute to catch up.
No.  That sounds more important. Let's forget about tonight.
That it would be a treat to make someone like you feel better... He gets like that sometimes.
That's yes?
Working up tears for a new piece cutaway...You totally crossed the line between...
You keep coming after me and looking down on me.  It's starting to make me batty.
Well, let's do a special report on that...I mean that's news.
What I don't know, I can learn and what I know, nobody can teach. Excuse me for saying it about myself, but I think it's true.  What do you think?  Never mind what you think.
You want to come?
Why did I have to do this to myself?  Watch you take off.  Call me if you need anything.
Well, there's a guy, but he says he'll fly up a lot.
I'm sorry because I was looking forward to that, but I' m going back in a few hours.
Uh-huh.
I decided to make a female figure after all!  I want you to pose for it.
What, right now?
Shh!
Um...
Whaddya mean?
Is the manager cooperating?
Me too.
Yeah.  Can some of you guys help me?
Here here...
Every word...
Carla -
Ok...tonight.  I'll make a statue of you tonight, OK?
What?
I'm totally serious!
Don't ask.
Why not?
Abstract?  With his talent for realism?
I do the research.
I saw a statue once called The Third Time Phyllis Saw Me She Exploded.
Didn't you hear him?
No man, he ain't the type.  He don't get enough vitamin E.
Dead Cat?
Alright get a grip on yourself Now since you're here why don't you start early, the kitchen needs cleaning.
Enough already about it - get to work!
OK...good night Mr. De Santis!
Now why shouldn't you, Walter? Things are different now...
These things take time Walter... but for now you've got to break out of this one...avenue you're on...
It was.
Well Why not?  I gotta make statues Leonard.  You heard Maxwell, they want me to make them.  I can't go back to being a busboy!
I can't talk right now.
No...look I'm busy...
Hi.  I know you!  I've seen you down at the Jabberjaw plenty.
Yeah I did.
Chasing the dragon?  Whaddya mean?  You sure you don't want a pancake?
Is that what that is?  I never seen any before.  I always thought that stuff was expensive!
Don't give me a hard time Walter! You don't want to get me mad!  You're coming with me!
I know that - I know that! I also believe in burning the creative candle, you understand, down to the end - to be uncreative you might as well be dead...a walking machine, toiling in a factory!
I see the rewards of achievement have come your way.
Walter, you did something to me with your work tonight.
What's got into that cat?  Well if you do see him, tell him I've got a nice fat piece of ocean-fresh halibut for him -
Well why don't you clean up this dump!
The other two -- the new ones. Where are they?
No... Not a boy...  Find out if they're dead.  And do something about that arm.  Honestly, I don't know how you made it through the Crusades.
Litter, yeah!
Let's move out!
That's it, man.  That's the whole story.
Do people ever call you 'Buffy the Buffalo?'  I'm just wondering.
We hate you guys!
Let me in.
Guys.  The environment.  I'm telling you, it's totally key.  The earth is in terrible shape, we could al die, and besides, Sting's doing it.
Hi, guys.
Maybe.
I... yeah, I'm okay.  I'm fine.
I just want to see the basketball scores.  It's important.
I do?  I guess I do.
Oh, come on, Buffy.  You know what's going on.  It's not working out at all.  I've got to move on.  I mean, I've got needs, too.  I told you about all this.
I am so sure.
Buffy.
Thanks.  Tomorrow morning, I'm on a bus.  I'm gone.
Well, I've always wanted to see Oxnard.
I think I'll just hang out here. Make sure the sun comes up and everything.
Oh, I'll be fine.  Got my chair, got my window, I'm great.
I don't know.  I kind of thought I ought to be here.  You know, this isn't exactly the kind of thing you can run away from.
I think I could help.  You gonna tell me you don't need help?
Merrick...
A dress.
I'm going to the senior dance.
But, Buffy, you're the guy, the chosen guy.
Benny was right.  You guys are all exactly the same.
'One that reflects the students' growing awareness of and involvement in the world around them.'
Why don't we see a movie?
Where?
You must come with me.  It's much too late already.  You must come with me to the graveyard.
You must believe me.  You must come with me while there's still time.
China.
Our purposes.
Cheerleading.  For... sporting events, yes?
Oh.  I thought... you lead me --
Oh.  Good.
I had to test you.
And you caught it!  Only the chosen one could have done that.
Two days ago, would you have even hit me?  Let alone so powerfully?
Good Lord.  What do you study in history?
Oh.
Fine.
You'll get used to it.  I'm more worried about your tactical mistakes.
Five.
There's a small village in Hampshire, near Stonehenge...  ... near a bunch of big rocks. That's where I was born.  My father taught me about the training, about finding the Slayers, reading the signs.  There's a small cluster of us, a few families, really... most of the neighboring villagers think we're just a bunch of harmless old loonies.  I thought so myself for a time, when I was younger...  I'm sorry.  I'm not supposed to... I shouldn't go on like this.
It isn't important.
Buffy, don't... don't start thinking of me as your friend.  It interferes with the work, and it...
As for example, what?
But it's in the back.  Why are we wasting time with this, anyway?
Make time, okay?  You're the one who told me to act normal.  I've missed three practices already.  If I'm not there for the Barber game tomorrow everyone's gonna talk.
Toasty.  You should come; it's gonna be a great game.
You got a C-plus?  I can't believe I cheated off you.
Sorry.
Nicole...
Are we so strange?  So alien to you?  I've seen this culture, the wealth, the greed, the waste... it's truly heartwarming.  The perfect place to spread my empire.  Honestly, Eastern Europe was so dead, the Communists just drained the blood out of the place.  It's livened up a bit in the past few years, but it's nothing compared to this.... this Mecca of consumption.  The city of Angels.
Really?
She has died.  You are the next to be called.  Why do you think you were sent to me?  Trained as you were?  You bear the mark.
Could be.
Got that.
No --
Where'd you learn how to do that?
Okay.
Seriously, Buffy.  That look was way twisted.  What were you thinking about?
Weird?  You mean like you hanging out with that homeless, Poke?  I saw you last night after the game.
Like you've got a grip.
You should think about leaving, too, man.  Sell this place... Something's going on here.  I don't know.  Something real weird.
I am.
Honey, don't ever listen to a woman when she's making love. They'll say the strangest things.
If I throw too hard I'll hurt the kid.
Much better.  Your delivery was fully integrated because you weren't thinking about it 'cause you were pissed off at me.  This is progress.
Cute?!  I hate cute!  Baby ducks are cute!  I wanta be exotic and mysterious!
I did.
I'll be back when we lose.
That's great!
Don't worry.
I got lured.
"I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions".
What'you see in that guy--he's dim, pretty boy.  a young, wild,
You're pulling your hips out.
Oh no, I think it'd be great! The Sporting News should know about it.
Let me.
I want to be had.
It's true, It's true!  Least it used to be true.  It ain't possible that baseball's not enough anymore, is it, Crash?
I heard already.
How come in former lifetimes, everybody was someone famous?  How come nobody ever says they were Joe Schmo?
I quit.  Hit my dinger and hung 'em up.
There  might be an opening for a manager at Salem next spring.
What's it say?
He'll learn.
Oh let's not...
The socks?  It's cold in here.
C'mon, God damn it, gimme some!
You missed him!
You spit on me!
You want me to call you a cocksucker?!
You're a cocksucker!
Now, Nuke, would I do a thing like that?  Hey kids, this is the great Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh.
By the dozen.  Holiday on Ice, Ice Capades, Ice Follies--  I'm through with one night stands.
God--what a Big League move.
I know, I know--I have that dream all the time.  We're almost home.
Jesus.
You outta your mind?  If you give in now you might start losing.  Never fuck with a winning streak.
I'm nervous--my old man's here.
Hey, guys, I got a game to pitch.
No.
Fear and ignorance.
I know.  I just like to see you get all worked up.
I don't need a crazy woman in my life.
The Crash Davis. ) And you, Larry Hockett, should recognize me 'cause five years ago in the Texas League when you were pitching for El Paso and I was hitting cleanup for Shreveport, you hung a curve on an 0-2 pitch of a 3-2 game in bottom of the 8th and I tattooed it over the Goodyear Tire sign, beat you 4-3-- and I got a free wheel alignment from Goodyear.
'Cause of Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.  The Big Club's got a hundred grand in him-
And where can I go?
What're you thinking about out here, Nuke?
It's a damn easy thing to play with.
Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior?
--we had the gun on him tonight-- the last five pitches he threw were faster than the first five. 96 miles an hour, 98, 97, 97. 97.   He's got the best young arm I've seen in 30 years.
You been around, you're smart, you're professional, you know what it takes--  We want you to mature the kid.
...and one helluva guy.
I heard he's wearing women's underwear--and he's breathing through his pingala nostril.
Jim looking for somebody.
Why are you doing this to me?
Now, instead of the cops only lookin' at Nicky, they started looking at Green too. And he was supposed to be our squeaky...
I was in the building!
It's a pity in this...
These guys back home don't give a fuck about the Supreme Court and any of this bullshit! They want things to quiet down. They want you to walk away from -
Jesus Christ! What gun? He's got a fuckin' hero sandwich here.
Not bad, not bad. In fact, uh, my wife's pregnant again.
Speeding?
He was a moocher, a card cheat, a country-club golf hustler. A scumbag... chasing dentists for a few bucks.
So, once she signs those papers, she'll be the only person to have total access to the box?  No one else, including myself?
Yeah, sure I do. Why?
I can't! I'm tied!
Eight.
You find any cash in there, we'll whack it up with you.
Hey.
Yeah, he had a fool-proof scheme, all right. It wasn't very scientific but it worked. When he won, he collected. When he lost, he told the bookies to go fuck themselves. What were they gonna do? Muscle Nicky?  Nicky was the muscle.
It was typical Ace. He invited the biggest people in town and he knew they'd show. Because he knew they all wanted somethin' from him.  With Ace, nobody ever got a free ride. Even Ginger. With her -
It was so obvious. I mean, all of Nicky's half-assed mechanics, they were real signal happy.
Four aces, Doc.
Be careful. Gaming agents are all over the place.
No.
...and he tells me to go fuck myself.
What? Ho-  Hey, come here.
Why, somebody's complaining?
What am I doin' out here? I'm tryin' to make a livin', that's all.
All right.
Yeah, I believe it. You got banned.
In so many words, yes.
Here, let's put a little of this on for you. I know you like this. A little butter, right, not a lot?
What're you doin'? He's a square guy, for chrissakes.  You can't treat him like that. He's gonna run to the FBI.
You mean, quiet like this: 'I'm the boss.'  That's quiet?
Yeah?
...uh, uh, cigarette holder. I'm - I lost control?!
You know, I didn't want to bring this up, but you have treating a lot of people with a lot of disrespect. Even your own wife.
Yeah.
A week ago it was my business, now it's none of my business. In other words, when you need me to take care of somethin' for you, then you need me.
The coppers blamed me for everything that went wrong out here, and I mean every little fuckin' thing too.
I -
Just give me the money. Fuckin' give me the fuckin' money, Sammy.
She's driving me fuckin' crazy.
Sammy.
No, I'm not okay.
Yeah, she's here.
No, that's quite all right.
I'm sorry, I can't do anything. He's too incompetent. And the bottom line is, he cannot be trusted.
Next morning bright and early, I get the call.
No, Ace.
...And this is Ronnie, who takes care of the card room...
Call security.
I don't care what she is. She's an institution, that's the problem. She's lazy.
L'chaim. [Yiddish for 'to life']
Oh, no.
No, just - just give him, give him ten. That's it. Ten.  I'll be right down.
Who's this?
See you, Ginger.
Hey, Mitch.
Yeah.
You do whatever you want. Do I keep my promises, or do I keep my promises?
Now look,  pay attention to me. What I'm gonna tell you is very important.
Well, what's the difference? I just need it.
What?
I under-understand that. I-I know I fucked up.
...twenty-five thousand?
Okay?
But even if you bought him a watch, a really nice watch, one that he thought was nice - and he doesn't know what the fuck a good watch is - so, you go, five, ten, twelve grand?
You hate my guts? I want you to come with me now.
I'll go, but I want my money right now!
I'll get your cash. You haven't been straight with me ever since I met you! You never loved me in the first place!  I need eyes in the back of my fuckin' head with you, you fuckin' bitch!
Fuck you!
And don't send your guys down there to stop me! I mean it.
You're stoned. You're a junkie. Get out of here.
Look, I tried to do this thing. I know that you want me to, but it's just - You know, I'm driving down the freeway and the fuckin' thing's 'beep-beep-beep-beep'. You know, I'm in a restaurant and it's - it's embarrassing. I don't want to do it anymore.  Where's Amy?
I know you were with somebody. Who was it?  I just hope it's not someone who I think it might be.  I just hope it's not them.
...you out of your mind? That's our child. Are you out of your fuckin' mind?
I ought to fuckin' have you committed. You fuckin' do that again,  I'll f-, I'll f-
I should have -
Get the fu-  You threatening me?  I'll fuckin' kill you in this place!  Get up and go home right now.
You get down here!
You'll wake the whole neighborhood!
Oh, you are...
You ought to be afraid, the way you fuckin' treat me!
What are you running for, Bob? What are you running for?
Don't you remember? You promised me a fair hearing when you were gettin' comped at my hotel and you were asking me for copies of your bills so -
That's amazing.
Don't thank me, just do it. You're the Slots Manager. I shouldn't have to tell you this.
Well, it's a casino. People gotta win sometimes.
Can you do it with your left hand?
And don't forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck around in here. You understand?
Thanks, Nick.
I don't want to go to Europe. I want to go to see The Elephant Man.
Come on, go back there? I never got paid my expenses for the last trip.
Well, I'm goin' all over, layin' money out of my own pocket, and I never get anything back. What the hell's goin' on?
Well, I keep layin' out my own fuckin' dough for these trips and nothin' ever comes back. I mean, what hell's goin' on? What are we doin' over here?
But how much cash could I bury in my closet, right?
Oh, listen, I understand that there's always a risk... you know, I might have to take a loss somewhere.
Well, I've been busy.
Sam?
He won't...
I understand.
Lady, I can't. I can't. I ca-
I can't.
Now move along.
Is that the last one?
Great!
He's gone?
Carmine left?
We can't help him if -
For what?
I'll take care of it, Remo.
I know.
Frankie... the little guy, he wouldn't be fuckin' the Jew's wife, would he? Because if he is... it's a problem.
Hm.
Keepin' Remo happy with money was the greatest insurance policy in the world.
But I knew how to keep the bosses happy. Whenever they gave me little jobs to do, you know, to send a message, I would carry things out...
No! No! I told him all about the guy before we ever got married. This is no fuckin' surprise.
So, he put aside some jewelry for me. A lot of jewelry.
I'm told it's worth about a million dollars, maybe more.
I should have never married him. He's a Gemini. A triple Gemini... duality.  Gemini's the snake. You know you can't trust the snake.  I mean it.
All right?
Yeah.
It's all right.
Oh, you're right, I know.  It's... well, I was just -
Nothin'.
Yeah. 'Cause, you know,  He's never gonna give me my jewelry.
'Cause you always tell me the right thing to do.
Come on, come on, you're a toughie. You can take this.  Don't cry.
A sponsor.
What about my money?
Get the fuck out of here. Get out! Get the fuck out!
I don't need you! I have my own fuckin' money!
I told him I was Mrs Sam Rothstein.
Thank you. Very nice.
Ginger, I've been watching you all night. You've been stealing from me.
Get lost?
No, you're not. Where are you? Where are you?
Okay, then.
That's - Yeah, he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, just waiting for you to call him back. That's what he's -
What do you think we're gonna do? He's probably got guys outside the fuckin' house!
'Go! Go! Go!'
Are they out now?
Don't look at me, pal. I gotta live with her.
Oh, there aren't?  What's that?  Huh? What's that.  There's no more. Thanks, hon.
Boy, look at this place, huh?
What a smart kid you are!  Okay, eat.
You call this guy and tell him I'm comin'?
I took care of everybody.
Pleasure.
But he never talked.
But, hey, what do they care, as long as I keep sendin' money back.
Let 'em complain. I'm the one who's here.
Go fuck yourself.
Walk, walk, walk. What'd you say?
You think he's goin' home, makin' a beef behind my back?
Yeah, what's to stop him?
Yeah, just let me know. But you gotta be ready. You know what I'm talkin' about?
Get her the fuck out of here. Get her out of here.
Take it easy. What could you do? I mean, she threw herself at you, right?
Fuck you!
Kill me, you fuck, kill me.
Mr. Chairman -
I didn't curse. I said 'frickin' head'.
Then do it the way you want.
Sorry, sir. The Cult is my life and my life is the Cult. By God, Captain God, I shall not fail you..
That's a good one, dude. He says we're going to kill you whether you tell us where the disc is or not.
Yeah, all those women who went feline this afternoon...They're so ashamed now..
Nothing, just a jolt of deja-vu. I think I went out with a guy with a dignified British butler--can't remember how it turned out..
You're probably right.
Hey, hey, the client comes first. You think I want my future children to know their Daddy created Frank's Fun Palace?
She has a real spirit.
Oh, you don't have to explain to me where you're going...
Yes, did you call us here for any particular reason?
But it's true!  You can call him yourself.
Boss, we better roll if we're going to hit this place, blow it up, and make that flight..
At this point, a nap. Oh by the way, I killed your butler and your dog..
What about "climbing in?"
Cactus, sometimes you don't deserve to wear our logo.
"Well done," Cactus.
Why am I still troubled...
What did you say?
Just a homeless woman. Wrong place.
"A superhero's job is to protect.." Sorry, I can't take you seriously...I overheard you say that tomorrow the Cult of Good will be dead--I should be so lucky--what did that mean?
Oh please, sir, one more. Are you the reporter or the architect?
Oh Frank, I'm not anti-male, I'm anti- you. Believe me, there's a difference.  Kelly is designing new uniforms for next week. Pay her and thank her. And is it a rule that the hottest places on the planet have the coldest air conditioning.  There's something out there called 73 degrees, look into it.
What if I were to say "Your Wife"-- as in does she know of your touching mentor-student relationship with the post-Bicentennial babe working the roulette wheel?
Most articles focus on the first half of her name--describing some feline monster.  I want the woman of Catwoman. After all, if it was a man dressed as a cat, the story would be on page 23--just another loony. Oh, I want this one. I want her bad..
What did--?
What?
I'm not through. This will come as a shock. Again, to one of you. I am Catwoman. The Catwoman.
It's funny, I've heard of giving up finding a man and raising a family to pursue a career. And I've heard of foregoing a career to start a family-- but I think you're onto something new, Selina. "Absolutely nothing"-- Has a ring to it. I think it could catch on...How's that for sarcasm?
Uh, it's just--that woman out there-- that horrible Hag. She's the one who keeps following me on her creepy little scooter--And now she's built a hut in the back..Why did you...
Yes, I'm pretty amazing. You should see this...It came this evening.
We met on the Internet. The Captain put out a cryptic message calling for a new order of crimefighters. We don't even know each other's true identities...
I'm not sad, no, I owe the Captain my life. It's just you think you want to help prevent crime, but you realize that's too complicated. It's a lot more fun to punish crime. Then after a while, you don't care what's a crime and what's not, what you became a Warrior for. You just want the kicks. The rush.
Thanks.
I don't see anybody in there but you.
Do I hear a woman's voice?
That's all we need.  Better let me drive.
I'll explain later.  I'm sort of on hold.
Then whose is it?
You could've killed us.
You got it wrong.  I'm the one that's on your side.
Or relieve me of it later.
Any time you decide to let me in on it.
I'll see that he stays calm.  Pack the money up and put it in the trunk.
Shit.  There's the hotel.  You overshot the driveway.
What am I supposed to do?
I've been trying to get someone -- anyone.  For hours ...
Will you let me explain!
I realize you don't want to be involved.
Because you know you'll be killing us.
I hear them coming upstairs.  I won't be able to talk for awhile. I have to lay the phone down and pretend to be asleep.  So don't talk.  Don't say a word or they'll hear it.
Rachel, my daughter.  She's an honor student at Parker.  My God, she's only nine.
They say she resembles me -- dark hair, ponytail, very dark eyes. They all wear the same uniform.  Please.  Be careful.  The man driving the car must have a gun.
How much time do you have left on it?
I'm sorry if I caused you to lose your business deal.
I'm trying to.
When Jack sees they've got Rachel HE'LL tell them what they want to know.
The City National on San Vincente.
I heard someone pulling in behind the house.  I heard Rachel screaming and then she stopped all of a sudden.  I don't know what they did to her.
The front door slammed.  Someone went out.  There's a different car starting.
Yes -- I think so.  Another crossed line?
That's coming off.  How about the girl?
You're all three of you in that van?
I'm sorry.  You've thought this out better than I ever could.  I'm ready now.
The video cameras will put you with him in the bank, and I'll bet there were enough witnesses.
Plus they'll remember you going after his daughter at school.
I thought it was inspired.
Why pick me to be your "mark?"
Stop talking like that!
Plus names, addresses and I.D. for the lot of you.  We're in this together and I need to know who my partners are.  In case I ever need to roll over on somebody.
No, there's a police car way back there.  See it, in the distance coming around the turn?  The van is blocking it now.
259-7881.
That's why we're turning off onto a fire road.
I can't hear.  Now there's a siren.  They must be in an ambulance.  What about the money?  Nels?
We had a backup plan.  But I knew you'd come through for me.
Nothing but CDs in there.  I thought maybe you'd like some Celine or Whitney.
Local lawyer for Dominican dealers.  Off to buy a half interest in a mall in Granada Hills on their behalf.
Toss them -- one at a time.  I don't want to lose count.
It's a nice day.  How about the beach?
Some loyalty.
Got a phone in that van?
Beats yelling our brains out across some parking lot.
It's your call.
I make my end of the cash at 184,000.  Now I'm trying to figure out the bonds.  What the face value is.
Put the girl on.
And if you ditch us we get zilch.
My compensation!  Somebody still owes me -- big time!
How do you know?
In your dreams.
Are you busting my chops or what?
There's no lady here.
Where is this canyon house where you're supposed to hook up?
From here on, I dish it out.
Then why doesn't she?
I'm sorry.
What do you think his name is?
An excellent quality.
It's Dave.
Don't throw my clothes out the window!
It's a simple question.
Not in my experience.
Must be.
They all get the wrong idea.
You know.
God no. I'm a hairdresser.
Jesus.
The things a girl has to put up with.
Whiskey.
Must be in love to manage that.
What do you think?
You say that like a gentleman.
I am.
Is this an obsession of yours?
All the time.
No...
I know that.
When?
Probably.
Are you pretending yet?
Don't be cruel.
Why, honey --
Not here.
Yes.
What?
For me.
Prescription. For my condition.
Don't go like that.
You knew which man?
I suppose I tried.
Don't you want to kill me?
Okay.
Got to be somewhere.
Yes.
Never.
Tell me what she wore.
Thirty-five.
That's wise, Tommy.
Fucking do. I had him all over me.
Suits you.
Och, you do, Fergie.
Was I?
Some judge...
The poor whore's suffocating in the heat.
Request permission to guard the prisoner tonight --
Good. So what do you think?
So, what do I look like?
Five ten. Brown eyes. But you're no pinup.
Do what?
What the fuck were you doing here?
Well then, you're going to have to take my dick out for me, aren t you?
Hurry up, would you?
Shut up, would you?
Yeah?
Having a pint in the Metro, and Dil's having a margarita.
But you fellas never get a break, do you?
What do you believe in?
No. Not bad. Women are trouble, you know that, Fergus?
Dil wasn't trouble. No trouble at all.
What does that mean?
Stop that talk now --
You won't run.
Hurling --
You don't know me, do you?
You'd know I wouldn't run off.
You didn't?
Nice lady.
You shut your face --
You're crazy --
How was I leading you on?
It's a toss-up, I can tell you that.
What about it?
I'm not hungry -- isn't it glorious?
Pretty good, huh? I taught them everything they do.
How do you think I got here?
Adam --
Why?
Well, I guess that's it -- dead end.
It's Thursday today -- and it's almost five -- come on!
Then who did? You're the only one left.
What makes you think they're even interested? It's only a quarter of a million -- it'll cost more than that to fix up their bookkeeping. As a taxpayer --
Mr. Bartholomew -- are you sure you know who I am?
Danger? Why should I be in any danger?
Thanks very much.
Well, there you are! Charles had the money with him -- so whoever killed him has it -- they have it!
You mean he might have -- Mr. Bartholomew, I'm catching the next plane out of here -- I'm not going to sit here and wait for someone to make chopped liver out of me!
Yes, where?  -- in fifteen minutes. I'll be there.
Agents.
Who?
Gratinée, choucroute garnie, salade de pommes -- et un ballon de rouge.
Yes. The five men. They were, of course, your husband, Charles, the three men who showed up at his funeral yesterday, and Carson Dyle. But something went wrong and they were unable to locate their contact. It must have been at that point that they decided to steal the money.
But what has all this got to do with the C.I.O.?
Oh, stop it. What do you want me to do?
But no one actually saw him die.
Next, please.
You'll wreck your raincoat.
Okay -- up there.
I'll give you a chance, Dyle -- which is more than you'd give me. Where's the money?
And I say maybe you both have it! One more time, Dyle -- where is it?
Then who does?
But he'd have to. If he left he'd be admitting his guilt -- and the others would know what happened. Whoever it is has to wait here, pretending to look for the money, waiting for the rest of us to give up and go home. That's when he'll be safe and not a minute before.
No cat and mouse -- you've got me. What do you want to know?
Would you like to see where I was tattooed?
There must be some way.
Reggie -- listen to me --
So was Juliet -- at fifteen.
Cutting it out.
Oh.
Tuesday.
Scobie -- he's the one that objected.
I'm scared.
First your brother, then Charles, now Scobie -- we've got to do something! Any minute now we could be assassinated! Would you do anything like that?
Let me know what you want -- I'll pick a suit that matches.
I dare you.
It's a start, anyway.
Fiction or non-fiction?
But I do believe it -- that's what I don't believe. So it's goodbye Alexander Dyle -- Welcome home Peter Joshua.
Adam Canfield. Wonderful. Do you realize you've had three names in the past two days? I don't even know who I'm talking to any more.
The man who bought them last week was American. I did not see him but I heard. I knew you would come.
I'm afraid it is important.
And if it is?
I don't know anything.
Stop it!
He didn't have one.
We took the liberty of calling your dentist -- we thought, perhaps, we would learn something.
Oh.  Neither do I.  Voilà!
Up there! I would put it up there!
I found it! I found it!
No, Jean-Louis.
Why, do you think we're going to?
Is there a Mrs. Joshua?
Oh. Well, wasn't it Shakespeare who said: "When strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again"?
You telephoned me to meet you. I've been standing on the corner back there -- waiting for you.
That's what I'm not supposed to say.
Then stop acting like one. If you're really in some kind of trouble, I'd like to hear about it. Otherwise, it's late, I'm tired and I'm going home to bed.
I think I sprained my pride.  Where'd he go?
A quarter of a million dollars.
That's all right -- it's a drip-dry.
What is it, Reggie -- what's he saying?
He -- he said if I didn't give the money, he'll kill me.
Yes?
But what?
Because I don't love him.
Don't you want me to stay?
Until two days ago all I really knew about Charles was his name -- now it turns out I didn't even know that.
How can you tell?
Hello, Reggie -- I am waiting for Jean-Louis.
He was so excited -- when he got the stamps you gave him this morning. He said he had never seen any like them.
Then he gets it out of your share, not mine! Not mine!
As fucking if.
WOULD that impress you? IS that what it takes to impress the empress?
The kids adore him. They confide in him. His patchouli reeking rear might know if Stacy and Rod were really virgins. Why didn't you ask Jody that?
Oh GOD Brent, is there anything you don't feel guilty about?
You tell these people someone is out there killing virgins and we're going to have a goddamn fuckfest on our hands.
It won't happen again.
Hi Daddy. Hi Mr. Sisler.
I'm not criticizing. _ Did you two get any further?
How much further?
I wouldn't ask if I didn't have to.
Never mind darling. You go back to school. I don't want you missing anymore classes today.
Run!
Are you sure?
Two kids were found mutilated in the woods. Lock the door after me.
This will relax her.
You know where I can find her?
No. She ate a pistol for lunch one day.
I don't give a fuck what your reasons are. You pay me ten dollars, you can go inside Otherwise, get a warrant.

I knew you were a pervert. Always wearing those fucking doofy glasses, and driving a station wagon.
Can you just follow me? The back is full?
You know about that too?
Because of your father. The way what his sins shaped you.
He's a rapist. Like mine.
I was born nine months after she was raped. One of the four men who raped her is my father. I have no idea which one.
Yes that's the whole point. This is what I was put on this earth to do. Rape the town that raped my mother. Steal its pristine innocence like it stole hers. I've planned this since I was a very little boy. You have no real freedom either. Your father has cast a shadow that you've never eluded.
You eventually have to talk to him.
You're going to look really amoebic splitting off from me now.
You could tell him you really liked the way he chews with his back molars.
What?
Didn't you have something a little more romantic in mind for your first time?
Stag?
Yeah. I think it's really sick.
No I'm really grounded. When I got in late the other night, my father was waiting up for me.
I do not.
I'll think about it.
So I should feel happy that he got away with it?
Jody, you're only doing this to get back at your dad. It doesn't have that much to do with me.
This party is sick.
Then go to the party. Run with the herd Kenny. Just don't spew out all that 'be an individual, assert yourself' crap anymore.
Hi princess.
The library. I'll be fine.
And the police did nothing?
How could you?
The word is Mob.
The men. Do any of them still live around here?
The principal?
Yes. He asked me to come over and talk to you.
Just thinking about something.
Did you want one?
No, you keep one.
You're the one who's hand is shaking.

Yeah, to keep him off my ass.
I'm gonna stomp your a--
I'm gonna bust a mudhole in your ass. I'm gonna--  Don't tell me to shut-- It's none of your business.  Man, I can talk all I want to.
Excuse me...

You'd better coast through...
Suppose you're gonna shoot me because you can't get service on my cell phone.
I did not steal this truck!
Fine.
You're nuts, goin' back there!

All right.

Thank you.

But he didn't.  See, that's negotiation.
Oh, oh!
...about him.
This country trained me to kill...

...such is the price...of patriotism.
Hey!
I did what I could for you...
...help you?
Mason, you have to take this...
Wait.  This town is full of trucks.  Nice new trucks.  You don't need to go...
He's the dude...
Thank you.
...including the permanently extreme.

I don't work for you, Captain Brynner.
The NSA thinks the UN is onto your work...
...destroyer of worlds."
You'll kill us all!
You look good, Richard.
Is that why you're here?  To blame...
I know where the  blame belongs.  But I didn't put you in prison, Andrew.  The government did...
What rational man could fit in with the sorts of things our government was doing? The sorts of things you've...
Forget about him.
Pleasant surprise.
I checked your release date.  I never liked coincidences.
Or I may be wrong.  The breeze could be gusting south.  That'd be Billings...
Nothing has changed, I assure you both. The Army still thinks we got Elvis.  They had a tactical withdrawal.  It's just those two amateurs now.  Do you really want to concede a hundred million dollars to them?

What?  Oh, damn near yes. Unless the animal's sick or something.  And the steam rising off it like that in the morning. That's life, Mr. Gittes. Life.
Would you call him a capable man?
Honest?
It's what the D.A. used to tell me about Chinatown.
Okay. My secretary'll send you a letter of agreement. Tell me are you worried about that girl, or what Evelyn might do to her?
She's fine.
With her mother.
What is it?
No, Mr. Gittes. That's what I am doing with the Valley. The bond issue passes Tuesday. There'll be ten million to build an aqueduct and reservoir. I'm doing it.
Just incorporate the Valley into the city so the water goes to L.A. after all. It's very simple.
What can I tell you, Kid? You're right. When you're right, you're right, and you're right.
You know, you're okay, Mr. Gittes. I know it's your job, but you're okay.
Thanks. You know something, Jake?
Oh they don't?
You bet your ass you don't. You can't even pay me off.
Call me Jake. How is everything?
Curly, where's your car?
Thank you...
The apple core club.
Give us things. Not just some old flag like this, but -
How are you, Lou?
Who?
You mean that's what you're going to call it.
You accusing me of extortion?
I don't think I need a day or two. You're even dumber than you think I think you are. Not only that, I'd never extort a nickel out of my worst enemy, that's where I draw the line, Escobar.
Well, I hope she wasn't too much of a disappointment to you, Lou.
What for?
Yeah.
Lou, she will kill you. Let her go for now. You don't know.
Take it easy, take it easy, it was an accident.
Of course.
Yeah. Fine, thank you.
Anyway... I... the point is, Mrs. Mulwray.  I'm not in business to be loved, but I am in business, and believe me, whoever set up your husband, set me up. L.A.'s a small town, people talk.
Mr. Gittes, you've talked me into it. I'll drop the lawsuit.
It's very personal. It couldn't be more personal. Is this a business or an obsession with you?
Yes. As I said, I was very grateful.
I have?
Why?
Did he know?
Where you were when your husband died.
I don't see anyone for very long, Mr. Gittes.  It's difficult for me. Now I think you know all you need to about me. I didn't want publicity. I didn't want to go into any of this, then or now. Is this all?
That your maiden name?
No reason.
Another satisfied client's wife.
For talking him into building it, he never forgave my father... They haven't spoken to this day.
Of course I'm sure.
They can't be.
I gave everybody the night off.
What were you doing there?
Doing what?
You can't always tell what's going on there.
Your eye.
...A flaw...
It has to do with my father.
Mulwray's girlfriend, for one thing. He wanted to know where she was.
You bastard.
I am not!
That's not what it looks like, Mrs. Mulwray.
...That's not what I meant.
Yes, we've got a 4:30 train to catch. Why?
She's my sister and my daughter!
Back to Mexico.
Yes, Mr. Gittes.
Yes, Mr. Gittes.
I think I got something.
Jesus, that's in Chinatown, ain't it?
Well I never expected anything to happen like what happened to Mr. Mulwray, the point is if it ever comes out I want somebody to know I didn't know what would happen.
Oh no.
A Miss Sessions calling.
Nothing to do with Dad. It's me, actually.
And Mulwray isn't?
Only when I breathe.
That's like saying they're in Arizona.
Yes?
Well... I think I... I would've remembered.
What about the water?
So how are you, Morty?
Drowned, too.
Yeah, got dead drunk, passed out in the bottom of the riverbed.
I'm afraid so.
Yeah, I'll do that.
He was expecting you?
Along with Mr. Mulwray.
They got into a terrific argument outside the Pig 'n Whistle.
Yeah.
Nothing. You got a hell of a way to make a living.
No, you have a press agent do it.
But that's what you told your wife.
She ain't exactly long in the tooth now.
Why'd she run away?
You don't say?
So I can have these?
Fifty lire...
Of course I knew your father. He was tall, thin, pleasant, and had a moustache like mine. Always smiling. He looked like Clark Gable.
Come in, Alfredo.
Now I understand why the soldier went away just before the end. That's right, just one more night and the princess would have been his. But she, also, could not have kept her promise. And...that would have been terrible, he would have died from it. So instead, for ninety-nine nights at least he had lived with the illusion that she was there waiting for him...
Yeah!...Getting there's downhill and all the saints help you. But coming back! The saints stand there watching you, that's all! God's will be done.
Yes, nice day.  ...I've got to go now. Bye-bye.
Sssssh, Be quiet, pretend everything's normal. I'm Salvatore.
I got back today. You can't imagine the excuses I had to make up to be here...
Who?
Sure, sure! Boccia...  What's he do?
No...
It's not true! No! It's not true!!! I'll show you he's coming back!
No, Mamma, it only takes an hour by air, you know.
I rather like it myself.  Send it right away.
Go on!
I can't take shorthand.
Sit down, everybody - for heaven's sake!
We certainly do.  Vacation's over - starting right after dinner.  But right now - that lady over there -  - that's the new society editor, I take it?  You think I could interrupt her a moment, Mr. Bernstein?
Please, Mr. Bernstein.
You and Leland and Mr. Kane - you were great friends back in the old days, I understand.
Enthusiastic?
He made an awful lot of money.
That looks pretty nice.
Certainly not.
Hello, Bernstein.
Mr. Kane is finishing it.
Mr. Kane is finishing your piece the way you started it.
Really, Mr. Kane, I can't see the function of a respectable newspaper -
It isn't finished?
He used to work fast - didn't he, Mr. Bernstein?
Thank you.  I can't imagine how Mrs. Kane came to make such a silly mistake.  The sedative Dr. Wagner gave her is in a somewhat larger bottle -  I suppose the strain of preparing for her trip has excited and confused her.
Of course.
Chicago is pretty close to New York nowadays - only twenty hours -
It can wait.
It may not be about anything at all.
I'm not interested in the voters of this state right now.  I am interested in - well, Junior, for one thing.
I don't think so.  Are you coming, Charles?
Too late for what?  Too late for you and this -  this public thief to take the love of the people of this state away from me?  Well, you won't do it, I tell you.  You won't do it!
Charlie, please don't -
Hmm!
If these sidewalks were kept in condition - instead of the money going to some cheap grafter -
In the water.
On the chiffonier.  Here.
You really don't know who I am?
I was only joking!  This evening I was on my way to the Western Manhattan Warehouses - in search of my youth.
As a matter of fact, I do sing a little.
Oh, no, that's all gone.
Half past eleven.
Susan, I want you to stop this. And right now!
Don't go, Susan.
Susan, don't go!  Susan, please!
You can't.
I think we'll have to send our friend Wheeler a cable, Mr. Bernstein.  Of course, we'll have to make it shorter than his, because he's working on an expense account and we're not.  Let me see -  Mike!
All right.
Marie has been packing since morning, Mr. Kane.
He was dead...  That's a poem.  Do you know what it means?
And I do it because they do it, and they do it - it's a vicious circle, isn't it?  I'm going over to Georgie's, Brad - you know, Georgie, don't you?
Good.
Charlie -
You've said a lot of things about the President in the last few months.
Charlie!
What's wrong, Brad?
That's just a little promotion scheme. Nobody expects you -  Mike, will you try and get Mr. Leland some coffee?
I know you will.
Yes.
Hello, Charlie -  I didn't know we were speaking.
It was for twenty-five thousand dollars.
Rogers isn't even pretending.  He isn't just scared anymore.  He's sick.  Frank Norris told me last night he hasn't known Rogers to be that worried in twenty-five years.
You people seem to forget that I'm the boy's father.
If I want to, I can go to court. A father has a right to -
It is.  Go on, Mr. Thatcher -
Never mind -  Bernstein told you about the first days at the office, didn't he?  Well, Charlie was a bad newspaper man even then.  He entertained his readers, but he never told them the truth.
I can remember everything.  That's my curse, young man.  It's the greatest curse that's ever been inflicted on the human race.  Memory -  I was his oldest friend.  As far as I was concerned, he behaved like swine.  Maybe I wasnt' his friend.  If I wasn't, he never had one.  Maybe I was what nowadays you call a stooge -
He knows the first Mrs. Kane socially -  That's the answer we got.
Yes.
The Bank's decision in all matters concerning his education, his place of residence and similar subjects will be final.
We will assume full management of the Colorado Lode - of which you, Mrs. Kane, are the sole owner.
Ask the question anyway, Thompson! Build the picture around the question, even if you can't answer it.
He married you, didn't he?
You're shittin' me.
Do you mind if I drink this here?
Children's programming. What did your mom say when you told her you weren't engaged anymore?
Wow, you got thrown out? For Dante?
No, this is great.
No, don't!
Very dramatic, I thought.
You could've broke it to me gently, you know; at least started by telling me you had a boyfriend. I told you I have a girlfriend.
Wreck is a harsh term. Disturbed is more like it. Mildly disturbed even.
And you came here to what? To comfort me?
There's more, isn't there?
I just believe in giving credit where credit is due. And I believe that I'm the impetus behind your failure to wed.
But can we date?
Let me take you out tonight.
You have a better suggestion?
So what are you saying?
Like what?
Um... okay.
I'm not kidding. I just got back from outside.
I didn't just fuck myself! Jesus, I'm going to be sick!
Oh God...
Just me.
We did.
Everything happened at once. I guess I forgot he was back there.
In a second!
I'll assess all I want!
Give me a stick, pretty boy! I'll knock your fucking teeth out and pass all over your ass.
Yes.
Why are the shutters closed?
No, thanks.
Did you tell Veronica?
Your mother.
You think things would be any different now?
Caitlin's on the same wave-length?
Return of the Jedi.
Blasphemy.
Right, the Emperor. Now the Emperor is kind of a spiritual figure, yes?
Now, he's in charge of the Empire. The Imperial government is under his control. And the entire galaxy is under Imperial rule.
Hence, the Empire was a fascist theocracy, and the rebel forces were therefore battling religious persecution.
The only problem is that at no point in the series did I ever hear Leia or any of the rebels declare a particular religious belief.
And you figured it out?
Basically.
So?
Not just Imperials, is what you're getting at.
This guy is going through all of the eggs. Look.
Obviously not. Look at all the cartons that didn't make the grade.
What kind of show?
Shut up!  Yes, I've calmed down, I'm still not happy about it, but I've been able to deal.
You've got a customer.
I don't know. You going to lock the video store?
Gatorade.
"It's not like we're gonna sell out."
Embolism in her brain. Yesterday.
Paulsen's Funeral Parlor. The next show is at four.
Wait, wait, wait. Has it occurred to you that I might bereaved as well?
I'm not missing what's probably going to be the social event of the season.
She meant nothing to you either until I told you she died.
You just closed the store to play hockey on the roof!
An embarrassing way to die.
That's embarrassing?
Bible truth.
I swear.
Come on. Haven't you ever tried to suck your own dick?
What, your dick?
Let me borrow your car.
If you must.
What?
Exactly.
I don't; you did.
Because I'm happy.
She went home, she's getting ready, and we're going out.
Watch the store while I go home and change.
No! Don't bring it up. I don't want to think about that now. Let me enjoy this hour of bliss. I'll think about all of that later. In the meantime, nobody mentions the V word.
In my absence, try not to sell cigarettes to any newborns.
I might be leaving early to go out with Caitlin, in which case you'll have to close the store tonight.
Could be.
WOULD YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP?  WHO THE FUCK IS IN THE BATHROOM?
Why do I have this life?
What responsibility?
Thank you. Why don't you go back to the video store?
You're wrong. Things happened today, okay? Things that probably ruined my chances with Caitlin.
Caitlin and I can't be together. It's impossible.
Jesus H. Christ, I can't!
The swelling's not so bad. But the FDS stings.  How's your neck?
Thanks.
Yeah, you cock-smoking clerk.
I'm not dealing.
Done poisoning the youth for the day?
Nothing personal.
How do you figure... HEY! You can't roll a joint in here!
A dollar sixty-nine, plus tax.
So.
I don't know. I wasn't watching.
Lasagne.
Maybe.
I'm trying.
I'm not asking about the color. I mean is it rough or cottony?
Rough, eh? Oh, that stuff rips hell out of my hemorrhoids. Say, would you mind if I took a roll of the soft stuff back there. I see you sell the soft stuff.
No, I mean the ones there. Behind the counter.
I'm not even supposed to be here today!
Yes! And I'm going to play like shit because I didn't get a good night's sleep!
Theoretically, people see money on the counter and nobody around, they think they're being watched.
Three including you.
I am. And that's why you should feel like a pig. You men make me sick. You'll sleep with anything that says yes.
Unlike you, I have a class in forty- five minutes.
After he gets a blow job, he likes to have the cum spit back into his mouth while kissing. It's called snowballing.
We went out a few times. We didn't have sex, but we fooled around.
All right! Shut up a second and I'll tell you! Jesus! I didn't freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked.
Something like thirty-six.
I called a locksmith and he said the earliest he could get here it tomorrow.
I don't want Caitlin...
Usually I just turn the can upside down.
A word of advice: Sometimes it's best to let those hard to reach chips go.
I've been here since six o'clock this morning. Why?
An angry mother called the state division of taxation and complained that the man working at Quick Stop Convenience sold her five-year-old daughter cigarettes today at around four o'clock. Division of taxation calls the State Board of Health, and they send me down here to issue a fine. You say you were working all day, hence the fine is yours.  It's doubled due to the incredibly young age of the child.
The due date is on the bottom. This summons cannot be contested in any court of law. Failure to remit before the due date will result in a charge of criminal negligence, and a warrant will be issued for your arrest. Have a nice day.
He's moving to the big city next week. He wants to be a metal singer.
My ex-boyfriend was about his height, but he was much bulkier. He could bench two-fifty, three hundred easy.
Oh, I know. If I had to work here all day, I'd be bloated and out of shape, too.
Your ruse. Your cunning attempt to trick me.
You'll be missed.
Yo, I don't have that kind of cash.
Yo, don't sell all that. 'Cause I'm gonna get the cash and buy it from you at John K's. You're gonna bring it, right?
Yo. I'll see you at that party.  I'll see you there?
Man! I hate it when I can't rent videos!
You came for that too? That's the movie I came for.
Twenty bucks.
How yo doin', Gabe!
C'mon, man--it's perfect weather for a monster, full-fledged gutrush!
What?
Nothing, just tourist souvenirs.
I don't know.
So...what are you, blind, son? This is a banana eating a monkey, nature in reverse.
Bags?
Qualen, glad you stuck around. There should be a few hundred cops looking to meet you.
Love's a killer, isn't it?
Hey, anything for a friend. How's the knee?
Look, I know--
My pleasure.
Give him the money.
You keep it.  Get up there if you can, and if you get a chance, do me a favor and kill him.
I don't expect you to understand.
Why are you yelling?
I can't.  Not here.  If you want, I'd like you to come with me...somewhere else.
I haven't climbed in months--you lose the feel.
Can't do it.
Neither can I.  What do you think they're doing now?
Want me to lead?
Forget it.  If that charge goes off before we can reach it, this whole damn crevice will slam shut on us.  This way.
What?
Jess, c'mon...
Hold on!  Hold on!  Reach up!
Forget it.  You're in no shape to climb alone. I stayed with you this far, and you didn't drop me, so I owe you. C'mon, let's go.  Hurry up, time is money.
Hand-holds?!  I can barely see them.
Forget it!  I refuse!
Gabe?  Wait 'til I get over there.  Tie the rope so I can come across.
There is.
What are you talking about?
It looks like a winding route.
Who's going with you?
<u>Negative</u>.  The winds are too high.  I'm going to ride out the storm here.  I'll take shelter in the Douglas Exhibition Shaft. Over and out.
On my way.  The cases are hooked up and ready.
We can't and he knows it.
What about it?
He can't be far away.  Find him. Go!
Hey, you dealt us this hand, we're playing it all the way. Move.
Insurance against him finding that last case ahead of us.
We've got a full crew, but we can squeeze one more, right.
We should be.  Everybody wants what we have.
There was some sophistos from the TV studios around the corner, laughing an govoreeting. The Devotchka was smecking away, and not caring about the wicked world one bit. Then the disc on the stereo twanged off and out, and in the short silence before the next one came on, she suddenly came with a burst of singing, and it was like for a moment, O my brothers, some great bird had flown into the milkbar and I felt all the malenky little hairs on my plott standing endwise, athe shivers crawling up like slow malenky lizards and then down again. Because I knew what she sang. It was a bit from the glorious 9th, by Ludwig van. Dim makes a lip-trump followed by a dog howl, followed by two fingers pronging twice in the air, followed by a clowny guffaw. Alex brings his stick down smartly on Dim's legs.
For being a bastard with no manners and not a dook of an idea how to comport yourself publicwise, O my Brother.
Welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, well. To what do I owe the extreme pleasure of this surprising visit? Georgie rises.
Thank you, sir.
She was very badly raped, you see. We were assaulted by a gang of vicious young hooligans in this house, in this very room you're sitting in now. I was left a helpless cripple. The doctors said it was Pneumonia, because it happened some months later during the 'flu epidemic. The doctors told me it was Pneumonia, but I knew what it was. A victim of the modern age, poor, poor girl. Suddenly his mood changes. He wheels right up to Alex.
Phoned some friends, sir?
I'm frightfully sorry. There is a telephone in the Public House about a mile down the road. I suggest you use that.
What the bloody hell d'you think you're doing?
No! No! Don't touch it. That's a very important work of art. What the bloody hell do you want?
Hahaha, and how are you feeling now?
I've got to rest, Mum... got to get fit, otherwise I'm liable to miss a lot more school.
Alright, Mum... have a nice day at the factory.
What gets into you all? We study the problem. We've been studying it for damn well near a century, yes, but we get no further with our studies. You've got a good home here, good loving parents, you've got not too bad of a brain. Is it some devil that crawls inside of you?
That's just worries me. A bit too long to long to be reasonable. You're about due now by my reckoning, that's why I'm warning you, little Alex, to keep your handsome young proboscis out of the dirt. Do I make myself clear?
That is correct, sir. And then all I can think about is like trying to snuff it.
Um... well, put it this way... I feel very low in myself. I can't see much in the future, and I feel that any second something terrible is going to happen to me. He pitches forward, face into the plate of spaghetti.
Oh, the old moloko-plus first, would you not say
Let's hope you make the most of it, my boy.
Aye.
Oh well, he met with like an accident. He passed away. Alex becomes a bit weepy.
Well, all this needs thinking about, son. I mean we can't very well just kick Joe out... Not just like that, can we? I mean Joe is here doing a job. A contract it is, two years. Well, we made like an arrangement, didn't we Joe? You see, son, Joe's paid next month's rent already so, well, whatever we do in the future, we cant just say to Joe to get out, now can we?
There, there mother, it's alright. He doesn't mean it. You were in the papers again, son. It said they had done great wrong to you. It said how the Government drove you to try and do yourself in... and when you think about it, son... maybe it was our fault too in a way... your home's your home when it's all said and done, son. Em sobs.
Murder, sir.
No, sir.
No, sir.
No, sir.
Right. The mothballs, Mister.
How're you feeling this morning?
Good. In a few minutes, you'll meeting Dr. Brodsky and we'll begin your treatment. You're a very lucky boy to have been chosen.
Well, that's good. I like to viddy the old films now and again.
I haven't seen you before.
Oh.
Can you... can you spare some cutter, me brothers? Alex rams his stick into the Tramp's stomach. The boys laugh.
I never forget a face! I never forget any face, be God!
Fine, my boy, fine, fine.
Indeed.
Have you ever had any attacks of fainting or dizziness?
Now then. Face the wall. Bend over and touch your toes. Chief Guard inspects Alex's anus with a penlight.
It says that you are willing to have the residue of your sentence commuted to the Ludovico treatment. Alex signs. Governor gathers up papers. Alex dots the last "i" and smiles.
Something to sharpen us up, you especially. We have the start.
Four in this block, sir.
Park Avenue and East 2nd. Take Centre to Canal, up the Bowery, Cooper and Third, left on 41st, come around on Park.
Sixth, you got delivery trucks blocking traffic at Herald Square. Look, I make this trip all the time.
I used to play this piece back in high school.
Different instrument altogether.  You know, if you'd only listened to me, we'd be bogged down in traffic right now, and you could have made yourself an extra five bucks.
This?  Temporary.  To pay the bills and save. I got plans...
Yes.
I'm...fine.  Fine.
Fella owned this place back then, Dix Dwyer, he let slip to Louis that I played.  So Pops, he just waves me right up.  My heart about stopped. But I got up there all the same, and we played for nearly twenty minutes.
'Fraid so.
Then let's have it.
Wouldn't dream of it.
Months now.  He's been feeding me information on Dmitri.
What thing?
Oh, right.  The guy flipped out or something?  Killed some people, then put a gun to his own head?
Jesus.  Two in one night?
Max never had many friends.  So much with the piano.  Always keeping to himself, it's unhealthy...
Of course I'm proud.  You know he started with nothing?  Look at him today.  Playing concerts.
You couldn't pick up a phone?  I'm lying here, wondering if something horrible happened...
What's he sayin'?
Yesss, you are.  He's artistic.
Who the hell is this?
Let's not get excited, sir.
I was just tryin' to...to...
Jesus, what is with this guy?
...well, last I checked, you were <u>sleeping</u> with me, so unless you wanna start fucking the guy soon, I'd suggest an attitude shift...
Yeah, yeah, sorry...
Twenty-four minutes.
You mean like benefits?
Last thing I need is a reason to keep hacking.  This job's a fill-in.
I don't talk about it, you know...  No offense.
Max.
I'm cool.
The trunk?
Yeah.
It's not me.
Yes!  I'm trying, I swear!
What?
I told you we had other stops to make tonight.
I Ching?  You threw a man out a window!
You don't know the guy in the trunk, either.  If it makes you feel better, he was a villain involved in a Continuing Criminal Enterprise.
How?
Why?
Lenny, my dispatcher.
It was an accident.  I'm not liable.
I can't do that.  He's the Man.  He'll fire my ass.
What?
I never learned jazz.
What difference does it make?
Jazz.
Don't start.
Fuck!  Nothing's ever goddamn good enough!  It's always been that way.
I told you I don't like to talk about it.
He's gonna <u>shoot</u> me?
No.
I don't know.
Then what are you?
None of your business.
Vincent?
Who?
Excuse me?
Just drop me off.
You know, Flip, Vietnam War was fought because of a bet Howard Hughes lost to Aristotle Onasis.
Motive?
No.
Sure.  You switched the charts, didn't you?
Arf... You gotta help me.
That's how long it takes to turn a hospital inside out.  A lot of people are after you, Jerry.
Right.  Sit up so I can see you.
Them who?
Yeah.
As opposed to?
I'm not sure.  I think I figured something out.  It must've been in my newsletter.
Believe you about what?
Um, coffee.  If that's okay?
This would be it?
Pretty scary, huh?
Uh huh.
Is he dead?
How'd he die?
Fuck you.  I know you're crazy, but fuck you.
What van?
Where'd you get your subscribers?
They're big details, Jerry.
A water main broke.
Those are song lyrics, Jerry.
No.  That wouldn't be fair.  Where are we going, Jerry?
Not today.
How come serial killers have two names, but lone gunman assassins have three.  John <u>Wilkes</u> Booth. Mark <u>David</u> Chapman.  Lee <u>Harvey</u> Oswald.
No...!  But they trained me to. M.K. ULTRA.  EX-CATCHER.  America works.  Get rid of the crazy people, the lone gunmen, and the system still works.
Can't give you the details because I can't remember.  I went to court to kill him.  At the Ezekiel Walters hearing.  I was supposed to shoot him at the press conference.  You were there. That's the first time I saw you.
He kept it in the side table in the front hallway.  He showed me.  I visited a few times.  Then one of Jonas's guys visited.  When I arrived, your dad was dying.
Your father, he was dying.  He was worried about you.  He took your picture out to look at it.  He called you his baby.
It's okay.  You...  You thought I was bad.
You saw me standing alone ...
Yes you do, Jerry.  Quite well.
I'm not sure what you mean.
I'm leaning toward no.
I don't know...
I'm sorry.  What was the question again?
A year ago I was leaving work late one night.  Two guys tried to mug me.  It was horrible.  Jerry came out of nowhere.  To my rescue. Then he started coming to see me.  Could've been a storybook if he wasn't crazy.  At first I did my beat to avoid him.  But there's something inside Jerry and...  Jerry made me see it.  <u>He made me</u> <u>see him</u>.  That make sense?
The truth shall make you free.
We're very specialized.
It was mind control.  <u>Manchurian</u> <u>Candidate</u> kind of stuff, right?
<u>My dog</u>.  One I intend to put to sleep.  Extrapolate from there.
I want this box rigged with a beacon!
Look, you're a nice guy, but I'm not really dating right now.
What do I look like to you? Switzerland?
I don't think so.
What?
All the elements are there.  A woman, orphaned young, under a great deal of stress.  The failure of a project she's staked her self-worth and very sense of identity on -- induces a fantasy of reuniting with her 'father in heaven' as it were. Is it possible?
I don't know.  Ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.
It's a hoax.  I knew it!
Tell me.
What if you're wrong?  No -- I'll grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence -- you can't deny the possibility -- and I believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly... profound is worth investigation -- and worth taking a few risks.
Then disagree but don't stand in my way!
No, thanks.
Really?  Congratulations, by the way.
Did I tell you we've expanded the search spectrum?  We're including several other possible magic frequencies -- not just the hydrogen line anymore.  I was trying to get inside their heads, y'know?  And I started thinking, what other constants are there in the Universe besides hydrogen, and then suddenly it was so obvious -- transcendantals, right?  So we've been trying variations of pi...
Interesting analogy.  And how guilty would we feel if we happened to destroy some microbes on a beach in Africa?
We've cracked it.  Lunacharsky found it.
Ellie... you should know that I'm no longer the President's Science Advisor.
A transport.  So are they coming or are we going?
In ancient times when parchment was in short supply people would write over old writing... it was called a palimpsest.
Put it on speakers.
I scanned it at Arecibo; negative results, always.
In fact, by all the laws of physics we know what you claim to have experienced is simply impossible.
On that old shortwave?  Maybe on a clear night.  Come on now, under the covers.
Mmm, that's a good one.  Maybe his echo...  Okay, no more stalling.
That's a beauty, Captain.  Now get some sleep.
You have your mother's hands...  There are no tests, Ellie.  We don't sit in judgment.  Think of us more as... librarians.  Curators of the Universe's rarest and most valuable creation...
But you said you wanted to help -- don't you see what it would mean?
A page-break signal.  A period.
-- of Hadden Industries.
That's what they all say.
Peter Valerian.
They can't.  I think it's against human nature to admit to that level of... insignificance; to not see yourself as basically the center of the universe.
'Any sufficiently advanced technology...'
And?
Actually --
You too.
Wait -- hold on a minute --
How long was I gone?
Very smooth.  It's Palmer, right? Where I came from a palmer was a person who cheated at cards.  Really though... the Bible describes a God who watches over one tiny world a few thousand years old.  I look out there and see a universe of hundreds of billions of galaxies, each with hundreds of billions of stars... I mean burn me for a heretic, but your God seems awfully small.
Some of my best friends are scientists.  They're saying the machine is alive.
If you came back.
I won't deny I was ambitious.  When I had my... experience... I wanted to tell my story to as many people as possible.  I'm the first to admit that process included making some compromises.  You didn't answer my question.
I don't consider you the enemy, Ellie.  I'm not 'out to get' technology.  I only ask the question:  Does it have to have all the answers?  I look out there and I see so much emptiness... People are so starved for meaning, and it's something they just don't seem to be getting from science.
Please --
I'll make it a dollar.
I allus hoped to see you well fixed and have me a crop of grandkids to kiss and fuss around with.
Here, Mom.
Nothin'. Ever'thing's cool's can be.
She took off with that convertible feller...
Yeah. Come on out, Luke.
I... I... I...
Git to work!
How my suppose to handle a dog someone jus' let loose?
Maliciously destroyin' municipal property while under the influence. What was that?
Yeah, they sure do make a lot of cold, hard, noise, Captain.
I'll give you fifty cents.
You jes' watch us!
Drag's been chain-ganging so long he's got a nose like a bloodhound.
I got eyes, don't I? How my not gonna see something like that?
He's been betting his head from the gun. Gotta have kings.
I call.
Mah baby! We're diggin' and dyin' but our boy Luke is lovin' and flyin'.
A cold drink? You mean one cold drink? To feast yore starvin' fishy l'il eyes on The Picture? A true vision of Paradise itself? With two of the angels right there in plain sight a- friskin' round with mah boy?
He's gonna be awright.
I didn't say nothin', Boss.
Your Lucille? Man, you better put them glasses back on and take a look at yourself.
That's what you're gonna have to do.
The man wants speed, let's give it to him. Ram it in and break it off. Go hard. Shag it.
Knock it off, Luke! You cain't talk about Him that way.
Luke, you got to listen to me. All you got to do is just give up nice and quiet, just play it cool.
You just said he could eat anything.
One rule! No throwing up. He throws up, you forfeit everything.
Forty-five.
Gettin' up, Carr.
Well, how far didya get?
That's all there was. Listen. Open your eyes. Stop beatin' it. And stop feedin' off me. Now get out of the way. Give me some air.
A little homeopathic cure for the willies.
Would you please get your hands off my face, Tallulah?  What happened to the newspaper?
Well!  Aren't we the daring one? What's morbid and ghastly enough in the news to make Doctor Helen set foot outside her door?  The antenna is gone off her car again.  I had no music, all the way to the market.  Let me find a garage for it?
When was the last time you washed your hair?
Oh, God, uniforms, more stress. Let her sleep.  It's a self-limiting: she hyperventilates till she passes out, then her breathing goes back to normal, and she wakes up singing like a lark.  We know, don't we, Princess?  Give her a couple of hours.  I know about this.
What pattern was that?
When was that?
And you believed him when he told you he had done that.
Inspector Halloran.  Homicide. You were supposed to contact a Peter Kurten?
Cut the crap.  You got a sheet the length of my arm...
You get me out first.
What Friday?
She don't want it.
I sent it by private courier, he didn't give it to you?  That son of a gun...!
Bet you never figured I'd follow in your footsteps.  It's real well- written.  You should read it -- you're in it.
Something personal.  Is he bothering you?
I don't care -- she's a cop.  That's the important thing.  Cop-ness, not sex-ness.  It won't be perfect, but it'll be good.
I have no life anymore.  I ruined your life, make me pay for it.
Inspector Halloran, Homicide.  I'm in charge here.
You're calling me a crank?
I think this is number three...
Inspector Halloran, that is so much bullshit, you don't like or admire me, but the beautiful part is I don't give a fuck.  That's the upside of having a breakdown.
Look at the bottom of the screen. You see the icon with the arrow pointing left?  Click on that... twice.
Show what?  It's gone.  He wrote a self destruct virus into the code, so it would only play until we try to copy it.  Then it erased itself. Gone...  Do you remember what you saw?
He's going home.  He slept over because I was a little anxious...
Hello, Ruben...  So that's that...
Why should I trust you?
What's that music.  It's Abba.  I can hear it.  It's Abba.
They get fan letters...
They're not talking to me.  Saks looks right through me.  I ask him for some bodies, for the phones -- he's so encouraging: "you make that <u>your</u> little job."  Condescending bastard.  Helen, on your lists to call is San Quentin.  Daryll Lee Cullum?
Look.  There's the order:  you wrote it:  DeSalvo, Bianchi & Buono, Berkowitz and Dahmer.  It's going to be Dahmer next.  Which means he'll kill a man.
W-We had a fight.  I called him... called him a name...
They never kill themselves.  How do you know it was him.  You never met him.  You never even saw a photograph...
If there's a one percent possibil- ity, can you live with yourself when he kills again?
The Boston Strangler, when was that...?
That would be much appreciated. Thanks.
I'm falling!  I'm going to fall!
They taught me at the FBI.  I was very good at it.  It scared me... I liked it.
Sir, Doctor Hudson and I see a pattern develop...
You touch anything, Mike?  Pick up anything?  Use the doorknob?  I don't want to find your prints on anything later and you tell me you forgot to tell me.
Yeah, you did that too.  You earned what you got; don't shit on it, that's all I'm saying.
Yeah, but she had divine guidance.
Honest to God, Ruben!
Quinn decided we should form a task force -- they're all one case, now. He wants all the senior detectives on it...  She wasn't killed here.
It's against your rules that I try to help a witness who's scared shitless?  Who's...
Bunch of Swedish women.  You're too young.
Good.
Yessir.  I have reflected on that, sir.  Which explains my gushing deference to you, sir.
You're damn right I do.
Helen Hudson...
Because I think I'm wrong.
So I'm maybe gonna lose three good cops?  You fucked up on this occasion, but don't be so hard on yourself.  There's something I want you to think about.  The book says if you use your gun, use it to kill, that's what it's meant to do. You tried to pick this punk off with fancy shooting, to keep him alive.  To what end?  You're not willing to kill, you can't be a cop.  Go get drunk.  I am.
Don't give me six years!  You never divorced Patty, did you?  So what'd you expect from M.J.?
What's going down with the sting in Chinatown?  That gonna be off your plate in a week or what?
She lies all the time.  Why would I say I fed her if I didn't?
In the private aircraft hangar. Anybody could have walked in.
No. What about your camera girl? Did she come?
Thank you.
The sergeant asked me to identify it. He didn't believe you'd gotten out alive.
What about his wife? The woman doctor? Have you visited her yet?
I think it's badly scarred too. From a motorcycle accident.
At home. I couldn't face all this traffic.
Not yet - though not soon enough for some people, I've already found. A death in the doctor's family makes the patients doubly uneasy.
We sat in B massive traffic jam under an off-ramp. I don't think we moved more than fifty yards.  I'm thinking of taking up a new job with the Road Research Laboratory. They need a medical officer. The salary is larger something I've got to think about now. There's a certain moral virtue in being materialistic, I'm beginning to feel. Well, it's a new approach for me, in any case.
That's the point. Besides, I know I can give something now that I wasn't remotely aware of before. It's not a matter of duty so much as of commitment.
Are you still involving me in your crash?
I can drive.
I live in my car. This is my workshop.
You could get your wish at any moment.
Where are you?
I did this already.
I apologize for the inconvenience, but I must ask you some...
We'll see about adjusting the dosage if that doesn't clear in the next  How are other things going?
Then, you should call.
Me? Nothing. Tell me more about the job.
But everything's OK?
Especially with a promotion in the offing.
Can I get you a glass of champagne?
Not even if it's something positive?
Lie?
To talk?  Well, OK, that might be good.
I answered these questions last night.
It's OK. It's not a pass-fail kind of thing.
Sometimes my food, and my clothes, and my underwear.
Paul.
Enough with the abracadabra.
Good God.
Don't be ridiculous.
Schizophrenic recidivism marked by hallucinations and paranoid delusions.
Tell the doctor.
Your family just met me.
But I do.     I love you, too.
Oh, right.     I'm ready.   How do I look?
I saw Paul leaving.    Did you do the dirty deed?
No, I need some serious household advice.
I've heard the mission in Santa Barbara is the place to go.
You like it?
Throw pillows, Letty. The sales lady said they're the latest thing.
I'll be forced to tickle you.
I'll see you tonight.
Sounds grim.
Are you OK?
You don't have to take care of me, you know.
Coming.
I got worried. Are you OK?
You don't have to know all this by Saturday. It took me years.
When he could get time off from the restaurant business.
It wasn't exactly a lie.
I think I should call someone.
It's not another one. It's my sister.  Aren't you happy for her?
Good going. I knew you could do it.
Huntley told me today that if I come through on the Benton deposition, they may consider me for senior associate.
Sure. Of course.
I'm calling in sick.
I don't feel like going to work today.
I'm sorry.  I'm just...I'm so tired lately.
You can get out of the dinner.
You just need to get more organized. L
Can you loan me a 20?
Yeah, I guess it's all right.
Or be up past ten or fraternize with other patients.
He's a patient here.
Here's the ring.
I heard your friend was back in the hospital.
I do apologize.    A student had a crisis.
So, in light of how the parents feel, and the fact the students are doing so well with the substitute, I don't think I can put you back in the classroom just yet.
What does that mean?
Shhh. They're coming to the cubic zirconium.
If you ever want to get those tapes, meet me in one hour at Grant Park near the statue.
When this is over you can say whatever the hell you want. I'll be long gone. Besides, who's going to believe you? You're just a two-bit crook.
Not today.   Where are your friends?
What?   This?
You're calling me on is phone?
Vincent's in the States on business.  That it?
-- I've got the tapes. If you ever want to see your brother out of jail do exactly what I say. Bring one million euros to your boat at six o'clock.
Yeah. That warehouse over on Merchant Street. The volume on our import business has risen dramatically. The proceeds this quarter will be supernumerary due to the --
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
No, I'm good, Angelo.
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
You should. You can learn a lot about the criminal justice system on a program like that. Very informative. Stay and watch it with me.
Some cash. Jewelry. The other stuff I can replace, but there's a cardboard box... photos of my mother. They're the only ones I have of her.
Half the tapes.
I'll destroy them when we get back to Paris.
I just want to get my people home. I know who you are and what you could do to me if I don't honor my word.
If you think because you're a women this can't go hard on you, think again.
No problem.
Why do I always have to answer the phone?
I'm trying.    It doesn't work.
You didn't buy batteries?
I think he's already figured that out.
I think if he told me he was going to steal Van Gogh's "Sunflowers in a vase" I would remember it.
Do I?
Better than spending my life crawling through windows in the middle of the night.
Hi. I'm one and this is two, three, four and five.
Good. Zero and Julien will go in through the window and disable the motion detector. The rest of us will come in through the front door.
That's Frankie Zammito.   The Under boss of the Chicago Mafia.
You steal some money from a man he gets over it in time. But these tapes. He's never going to stop looking for us.
All you are is a professional ass-kisser.
Has to be.
You better.
I promised Bonanno I'd destroy the tapes.
How much?
Hey, idiot -- I've got stolen wheels and a stolen radio in the car.
Hard to say.
You said don't do it, boss.
Send some flowers. Something nice. Roses or carnations. And one of those get well soon cards.
Okay boss.
Some French guy. At least that's what his passport said. You know Joey, I shouldn't be talking to you about this.
No. It's just that the French guy had a gunshot wound on his neck. So, this is a homicide. Are you guys involved in this?
What is it you do, Sami?
Okay.    I will have a beer.
It doesn't matter where we go. Between Zammito and the FBI they'll find us. We have to end this here.
Pink panther, black panther. Who gives a shit? And I don't remember asking you a God Damn thing, you little turd.
Yeah, I can see that.

God, I want to go home.
No.
Get in the car.
And I'm tellin' you it ain't! Now, turn your taco-eating ass around and get the hell out of here.
How?
Watch this.
Julien, what you're doing right now is a very normal psychological reaction to stress. You're projecting your anger onto us.
I'm more of a whiskey drinker myself.
Zero did not put it in his bag.    He put it in yours.
Just lucky I guess. How'd you start working for the Bastaldi's?
So you arranged to have the people you worked for robbed?
Something like that.
It's not your fault.
It's three in the morning.    Not much else to do.
It's for you.
Wait!  I'm a friend!
What's it to you?
What's it to you?
I heard you met Shu Lien today.
I have a guest.
Beautiful but dangerous.  Once you see it tainted with blood, its beauty is hard to admire.  It's 400 years old.
Really?
How so?
You are fornuate to marry into such a noble family.
Yes.  Did you know I was once engaged to be married?
I am not an aristocrat, as you are... but I must still respect a woman's duties.
I'm just borrowing some clean clothes.  I'm not staying.
Go back to them first.  Then you can decide about Lo.
He really loves you.  Come back to Peking with me.  We'll find a solution.
So you're still that little boy looking for shooting stars.
You must decide.  You might get tired of this life.  You might begin to miss your family.  If it were our daughter, we'd look for her too.  She would miss us.  Jen... I want you to be mine forever.  I will make my mark on the world.  I will earn your parents' respect. We have a legend.  Anyone who dares to jump from the mountain, God will grant his wish.  Long ago, a young man's parents were ill, so he jumped.  He didn't die.  He wasn't even hurt.  He floated away, far away, never to return.  He knew his wish had come true.  If you believe, it will happen.  The elders say, "A faithful heart makes wishes come true."
Fine.
It's time for me to leave it behind.
Is there any place safer than under the nose of Governor Yu?
That's not what I meant.  I don't care about the sword.
But Wudan does not accept women.
I wish there were something more I could do to help you.
All right.  I'll write you an introduction.  Take it to Wudan. Wait there for news from me.
Not everything is an illusion.  My hand... wasn't that real?
Not a bad idea.  Tonight we'll get a good night's sleep at headquarters.
Jade Fox drugged her.  How did you get here?
A female criminal!  Now that's news!
We must avenge mother!
Father!
Don't be coy.  I've always known about your feelings for each other. All these years, it's a shame... neither of you is brave enough to admit the truth to the other. You're both wasting precious time.
When it comes to emotions, even great heroes can be idiots.  Tell me if Li Mu Bai is not more open the next time you see him.  I'll give him an earful!
What do you have in mind?
You know, you sure got a hard-on for a guy that's guilty of zip on paper.  Top Dollar runs Showtime; what's the matter, don't you like adult entertainment?
Care for a hot dog?
This is special, darlin'.  Please?
You gonna wind up working at a school crosswalk.   that doughnut's chocolate you, know.
I told you you're not supposed to come in here.
Fun -- look at that guy...
Fun, he's not going away; he's scaring the piss outta me!
Who?
No name.  You sure ask a lot of questions.
I think he's yours, now.
And she'll be alive.  Up here.
You mean you'll, like' dig your way out of the grave?  Euww.
Mom tried to cook.
Five large, in the drawer right over there.  I never saw you.
That's ancient history.
You don't even remember...
I want the girl.  Unharmed.  Now.
You're too late.  There was a guy outside - on the stairs - you really need to talk to.  But he turned to dust and blew away.  I don't have any power for you to take.
Yeah, I got a more fun idea myself.
Shelly?
Yes.
Go away.
Nice speech.  What's it supposed to mean?
Who the hell do you think you are coming into my house and saying those things to me. My brother is dead, have some respect.
You what?
Really? I thought he said it all the time.
Not a whole lot. We take some classes together. He's got a bad rep, but it's mostly bullshit.
A friend wrote me.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you... but you still didn't answer the question.
It's not really important.
You talking to me?
Great book.
Why don't you come join me for a swim and we'll discuss it.
Thank you.
What? Another letter from your friend?
I don't... I don't want to answer that... look we're friends.
No thank you.
I'm not going to speak to you till you realize that you can't intimidate me.
How was your date?
Okay.
Not at all. Have a seat.
You are very pretty. I would like to kiss you.
Where are you going?
I think that's for the best.
Get off me.
It was perfect.
You don't even know me. The fact of the matter is there is some one I love. She's smarter, prettier... you don't even compare to her. The only reason I am here is because she wants us to be exclusive.
Thank you, Annette. Chance Hill has been with my family for over sixty years. Does your family do much riding?
I'm sorry about that.
I shit you not. McConnell used to sneak in my dorm room drunk every month. We'd go at it for a while, then as soon as he'd cum, he starts freaking out. You know -  "What are you doing, man? I'm not a fag. I'll kick your ass if you say anything."  It's like, for Christsakes Greg, you're gay, deal with it. The only reason why I let him continue with his charade is because he's got a mouth like a Hoover.
Alright, I believe you. Stop crying. Your secret's safe with me.
Relax. It's okay. Take a deep breath.
He's alright.  He kept talking about this bulimic headcase he dumped over Fourth Of July.
What a loser she must be.  Anyhow, Court's invited me to the Hamptons for Labor Day Weekend.
Okay.
Why?
You'd do that for me?
It involves your brother. He... took advantage of me.
I don't know.
I don't love him. I love Ronald.
Just taking your photo.
My mom? Don't call my mom.
I swear.
I don't want to kiss you here. I want to kiss you there.
Good night Cecile.
I know.
I do.
Don't be insecure, Doc. You're a big help.
You do?
Yummy.
Really? Care to make a wager on that?
What, nervous I'm going to win?
You told her I never said I love you before?
I told you I don't know.
But I can't even see her. She doesn't have her own phone, I don't even know her e-mail address.
I think he's high on drugs. He hit me, then took off. I'm afraid to be alone. Please come over.
He doesn't scare me. I'll kick his ass in.
Don't worry about it. I'll stay.
So that's what this is all about.  We'll get together and plan your curriculum.
Sounds intriguing.
Even there?
Blow me.
But who will they turn to for help?
I hate it too.
Well, let me know when you do. Until then.
Cecile.
I'm aware.
With who?
She shot you down.
Oh come on, Kathryn, it was just a contest.
I've never done this before.
Didn't you hear what I said?
I'll do my best.
I hope I didn't keep you from something.
Mrs. Caldwell I think you're misunderstanding something.
Whatever. You are never to set foot in this house again and you are never and I mean never to see my daughter again. Is that understood?!
It's really important.
Yes, you already did.
I did?
Don't worry about it.
Ronald, you don't know what you're talking about.
That's exactly what I told Mr. Reed, but he insisted upon remaining home from business to talk to you, Miss Callahan.
I'd love to.
But you don't keep a cat, do you?
How?
That's what I wished on. Edward says it's a wishing ring -- and it is!
On the back street  a green house
Wouldn't it be just the same, darling, if daddy dropped the present at Mrs. Farren's on his way to town tomorrow morning?
I wonder if you don't resent that in her?
She's not Irena's child -- there's nothing of Irena in her. She's my child.
Amy's been lying again.
I'm not shouting at you, but there's no doubt in my mind that you spoil this child!
I'm sorry. I was somewhere else. He returns to the card game.
We've got to go on.  Amy, here, all this time, you've let your mother and father think you had forgotten that old dream life of yours. Now we find you've only kept it secret.
No, she went runnin' off to some old house she was talkin' about yesterday.
I live right here.
I can not tell you.
Oh, that is more beautiful than I ever imagined it!  I wish I could show you to mommy and daddy.  I wish you could enjoy Christmas with us.
It is wildness and freedom. No one can touch it.
Yes, Amy.
Maybe, if it's a real mourning ring like we have in Jamaica. All you got to do is turn it on your finger, close your eyes, and make a wish.
I do suppose so. But if you were there yesterday, guess you can get there today.
But what happened to the little deer?
But it was alive  it was fast and strong!
Stranger? Julia Farren a stranger. Why I've played every theatre from Boston to San Francisco. I've been to London and Paris. Those days  those beautiful, shilling, golden days.
Then I'll tell you a story  a lovely story. Do you know the story of Rapunzel?
Yes, yes -
Yes. Yes, Barbara, I shan't forget.
That's from her -- that woman.
Wait a minute. Listen.
Got more leaf mold now than we'll ever need, Mr. Reed.  I thought I'd burn 'em up and get the yard clean.
That's because she made a promise, and she'a keeping it, aren't you, darling.  You saw the way she played this afternoon, Edward.
Good heavens! What could you be giving me. Little Miss?
Something to do with a butterfly-- they were quarreling about it.
Can we get some service here?
James Dean, Humphrey Bogart...
Your lips look delicious.
Never felt better.
Okay, but I'm worried about the next PMS bout. It's gotten worse. I'm not myself during it. I get bloated, irritable, my breasts get huge, my nails turn into claws, my teeth get sharper and I have more facial and body hair.
I get crazy dreams and I black out.
Well that's not going to happen tonight. George said Carlton's a nice guy.
People notice you Frida.
I get a little bloated sometimes.
Or if your boyfriend's an asshole.
What a bitch. You should see a doctor. That can be dangerous. George bit me once and I had to go to the emergency room.
Holy shit, I'm a freak.
Oh, my glasses! Maybe my eyes got stronger from not wearing them.
There you go, blaming yourself for everything again.
To sound like big macho cops. He was probably just found with a knife in his back.
No. I don't think so.
I ate a burger in the afternoon and a steak and a half with Gregory.
I couldn't stop eating steak. I felt out of control -- like I was making up for all those years being a vegetarian. I couldn't get enough. And then Gregory walked me home... and he peed in front of me.
He was trying to get into my apartment and... I know this sounds gross but I was so turned on. I grabbed him and kissed him!
And my bra finally fits again.
Okay. I guess so.
I think he called you beautiful.
I can't help it. My bra wouldn't even fit. I've been going to Victoria's Secret and exchanging bras for bigger ones and still I'm busting out. It's this PMS.
It's just cause mine is finer. A little bleach'll fix that.
I haven't gotten it yet.
Why not? There's been a murder.
I think I turned into a werewolf and killed him.
That's a terrible thing to say. Frida goes back to scrubbing the floor.
Does that mean this whole thing is over?
Who is this Madame Sconce? Let's find her and talk to her.
Guess she never found true love.
You'll get through this. You were fine for over three weeks.
No. I won't let you do that.
No, I'm serious. How about we have dinner and I tell you about it?
They say sex is great for cramps.
Knock what off?
You never say that.
You haven't even paid me back the thousand bucks you owe me!
This really isn't a good time.
Take your shower.
On your desk.
Your desk.
We... he walked me home and... we said goodnight. Um, he kissed me goodnight and that was it.
Intriguing?
No really, I love knowing what people read.
Me neither. That's why I wear briefs... So why did you and... Mark break up?
Oh, nothing's wrong. Just... well don't you have your period?
A man killed in Central Park.
Mark wouldn't hurt a fly.
No, I got it. It's okay.
I thought we were starting something... and then... I know it's unorthodox, I mean with you being involved in the case and all.
What's that supposed to mean?
Like I had to say it? No, I wanted to say it.
I love you too.
They're for my cat. I use them to train him not to rip up paper.
No you can't. It... it gets so bad that I become a werewolf.
I knew you wouldn't believe me! Just go away. Go very far away!
I don't think you'll hurt me.
What about... those guys... I might have...
I'm so sorry... I... I couldn't help it. You know I didn't mean to... to do any of that.
Oh my god, what happened?
Two bags for them, and one bag for your head in case her two fall off.
Tell her I'm eating.
It's so bad she becomes a werewolf.
Don't be stupid George. Obviously if she's a werewolf, she can't be around a cat. She might eat it and besides, cats are afraid of wolves.
I told you she was innocent.
She was never a suspect Lloyd. Some animal must have done this.
And you think I'm sick?
Okay Lloyd, you tell me how she killed them.
Deal. And if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, shoot him.
This one walk you home too?
Hard to tell. Looks like he's been cleaned up and he's decomposing as we speak. This case gets weirder by the minute.
Which brings up an interesting point. I wasn't following you. I was following the suspect. And you just happened to be there...
Just this morning. Animal hairs were found all over the victims.
The other one?
He tried to kill me!
Yes, of course.  Everything's fine...
I think it's time you introduced us to your little friends.
A hunch.  He might be able to...
I didnít requisition a secretary.
Fine.
Won't say.  Says he must talk to you.
Yes, sir.  <u>Everything</u>?
Don't know much, do you?
Well.  The only thing I've been certain of, all this time, is that I need to get to the ocean.  The point is no one seems to know how to get there.
No...  No doctor...
No.  Have a look.
Then we must call the police.
Shut up!
You think I haven't been trying!  It's like there was never anything there.  Just water.
I told you, I can't remember a thing!
I have to go...
Not that again...
Nothing.  I don't know anything!
Don't worry.  You won't even see her.
Great.
It's in the little leaguer who may strike out but knows in his heart that at least swung...  Hands to the side...
... Alright.
I mean,  if it's a problem...
Alan
Well it's a last minute change.
I can't believe he'd do this.
Bob...
And...
Fine.
Clean.
Sort of... Yeah.
This is undeclared income.
Well, it's...  It's sort of an... an `incident'  really...
I'm afraid so.
Well... I gues I would... Yeah.
In the car?
I don't think so.
What?
What?
Right.  We can pick up on the rest tomorrow.
Oh, I know, I know... It looks awfully bad.  It's really embarrassing.  But it was Bob's idea.
You're spending forty-three million dollars on an ad campaign to...  'Boost consumer confidence in the American auto industry.'
Dirty business we're in sometimes.
Yeah... Sometimes they do.
What?
Oh... Kinda the same way.
No.
Yeah.
I had a feeling.
No thanks.  It's not that far.
I'm outta here.
Oh yeah?  Me, too.
I don't know.
I don't know.  I hadn't thought it out that far.
I don't mind.
You mean when I'm not running the country?
You find people jobs?
It was inspirational.
I can't.
Looks like we're not going to get a chance to get much done.
Hi.
... Me, too.
We're doing our best, sir.
Father Mclntire.   He blessed you at the inauguration.
All set.
Maybe. We'll have a little talk first. Then....maybe...I can help you out. String him up.
There are no...headquarters. There are no...rebels. Only the walking dead. Don't you see. They have won.
Leave him.
The tunnel.
Hmmmmmm? Oh, yes. Go on.
...Captain Rhodes is trying to...
That's right. 'Bout eight, if that suits. We'll start out in my gymnasium an' progress on from there...to various other forms o' physical therapy.
We ran up against a platoon of soldiers. There were actually walking dead...in uniform...with guns.
I know you can. Like I said, we been watchin' you.
What is it if it ain't a curse?
That sounds like a curse to me.
You disappear in here, darlin'. You get a knife in yer belly or too much shit in yer veins. You get lost out here and nobody's gonna notice. Rhodes, he counts on that. It all makes for food in the freezers.
He's just finding another reason for bumpin' us off. Don't ya see. He needs us ta die. He needs our bodies.
We're only about a quarter-mile from Cave entrance number five.
Forever, darlin'. Forever. 'Til he turns ta dust and blows away on the wind.
I say we got a boat. Can you get other stuff?
We're gonna blow up the powder magazine.
Quicker than gas. And it smells a lot prettier. It usually don't kill but it puts ya under fer a good night's sleep.
I say it's poetic. Pure calypso, brother. The Devil's Trumpet blowin' the notes o' doom for the Devil's troops. Ha ha ha ha ha...
We must wait. One day the curse will pass. One day a dead man will... will...
Shhhhh....Tony. Rest, rest.
...but most of all because...they offend Thee, my God...Who art all good...and deserving...deserving of all my love...
They will never be satisfied with anything else, Miss Henried. They want human flesh. I'm prepared to take whatever steps are necessary to see to it they don't get mine! Not while I'm still using it!
That bastard. I didn't think he'd make his move so fast.
Oh, bullshit, Mary. It's because Rhodes is a prick.
I'll have somebody's ass for this. I'll have your ass, soldier. I'm not gonna stand here and...
Just....following procedure, sir. They're entitled to burial.
Rafts. Two 38s. A little ammo.
Well, no shit, Sherlock
Knox?
Yep.
I'll tell you later.
It's every bit as hard as they say. Unless you're a genius like Meeks.
I'm sorry.  I, we
what?!
No one, sir.  It was just me.  I did the proofing so I inserted my article in place of Rob Crane's.
Nothing, unless you object to having girls here.
What good will that do?
It's not all right.  Come on, Dad
It does?  What?
The pleasure is mine.
Ridgeway High.  How's Henley Hall, Gin?
Hello Chris, this is Knox Overstress.
Huh?
And if it so happens that you're wrong? If it just so happens that I could care less About you?
Then come with me.
Precisely, Meeks. Greek for the herd. However, be warned that, when you say "the hoi polloi" you are actually saying the the herd.  Indicating that you too are "hoi polloi."
"We went to the woods because we wanted to suck all the marrow out of life." Anybody want to read?
YAWP!
His hands reach out and choke me All the time he mumbles slowly.  Truth... Truth is like a blanket that always leaves your feet cold.
Ah, so you boy's have been snooping.
Okay.
It's not too bad.  It's a tragedy! Why does she have to be in love with a jerk?!
Why don't you read it to her? It worked for Nuwanda.
But she's in love with: the moron son of my father's best friend.  What would the dead poets say about that?
God, I want to do everything!  I'm going to explode.
Father, I wasn't disputing you.
Yes sir.  I'm sorry.
Nobody-  I thought I'd surprise you. I've got all As and-
Forget it, Pitts, you're coming.  Meeks, your grades hurting too?
Found what?
Quiet.  I have to think.
It's my birthday.
Maybe they don't think at all unless it's about my brother!  His birthday's always a big to-do.  The stupid thing is, I didn't even like the first one.
Yeah!  And just look at this ruler!
This play?
Do you have to quit the play?
And where is our point of arrival?
Dead.
I told you...
Just trying to get to my boat...
The thieves.
Jesus Christ lady...
Nothing...you want to come, come... you don't...
You people...rich people...
Hey! I didn't have to come back.
You're saying they can think?
If you blow up your boat, how are we going to get to the island?
I'm flying blind here God damn it!
Me??
I'm stuck...
Joey, you want to get sucked out by a giant fucking mutated squid?
A little to the left...
Nowhere...
She fucked me.
I know...
Damn right!
What?
Hey Geraldine, let's eat!
Fuckin' A!
John,we're going huntin'.
We're all going.
Nick, Vince, Albert and John.
Yeah, Sal--
I'll get it! Where is it?
Yeah. Oh, boy, yeah... Jes', you must be tired.
I know! I fuckin' know!
I do!!!
She does not!
Hey, Nick! God damn!... What've you been doin', I mean...
Yeah.
But I insist.
I show you. Come. You come.  Linda have special, crazy fuck. That right?
Thanks.
You know a guy named Merle?
Shhh! Albert's gonna hump the Coup de Ville.
Oh, well...
Fine. Hey, I'm fine.
No?
She's out of her tree, Nick. She is straight out of her tree.
No.
That was nothing. That wasn't anything.
Is that what it is? I couldn't figure out.
Naw, it's... This guy wants his money.
Oh, it's great. Fine.
I'll kill 'em. Anybody bothers you, I'll kill 'em!
Right here.
This is horrible!
There's Vince!
You're a fucking nut. You know that, Merle? You're a fucking maniac!
Pow.
What are you, God?
What do you mean?
Three bullets -- minimum.
When you get the AK, open up. You got me? Open up.
How much? How much do you wanna bet?
Watch it, shithead!
Then lemme have 'em.
No!!!?
John Wayne... Listen, Nick --
Listen, Nick --
No.
Here. Behind you.
It's not socks, Sal.
Merle gave me this?
But, Nick... Hey, I mean, where would a guy like Merle get money like this?
Phantom Mary?
Naw.  Uh-huh.
One, Vince... you have to understand, doing it with one... would be... like nothing. They're small, see, so if you're smart you get about six or eight. I mean, if you want to have any fun.
Down.
What'cha got, Bennett?
Kimberly!
Avon Lady!
Who are you?  What the fuck do you want?
No, you're not model material.  Anything else?
Your mother.
Maybe re-animating you wasn't such a bright idea.  You look like shit.
Later.  I want Doucet first.
Got compliments coming outta your ass, don't ya?
You can't win like this.  You'll only get older.  This is what you wanted!
He could be brought back.
It's a real mess down here.  Some- thing must a'gone wrong.  No man could possess that kind of strength after being frozen for twenty years.
How do I look?
Commissioner Gallagher gave me specific orders not to let you drive until you re-familiarize yourself with the process and territory.
But Sergeant...
I was set up.
'Bout the same time I busted Doucet I tried to nail this big-time dealer. I didn't have an ID, but I was close. Too close.  Gained the confidence of a badass named Dubbs.  He was going to turn me onto the big man.  He made me for a cop.  Mysteriously my fellow officers discovered ten pounds of heroin in my cruiser.
Hey, Rip Van Winkle, maybe we'd better call it a night.
Good night.
Never use it.  Stuff'll kill ya.
We get to peek into Doucet's brain.
This should make your day.  The guy who testified against you... Dubbs... was arrested a total number of twenty- four times.
Hospital food.
Says here one of our boys brought him down.  You ever heard of a badge named Wade?
They always are.
Yeah.
It's stuck, but thanks for the offer.
No, Jabez -- your place is with your wife --
We will --
Jabez! Careful --
They are all friends of mine -- from over the mountain.  Welcome! Help yourselves to drinks! Glad you could come! Have a good time.
Lying to you -- Why should I?
That's my problem, Belle.
It hasn't opened yet?
And what about Daniel Webster?
No, Daniel -- they are not race horses. They are good old friends of mine. I call 'em Constitution and Bill of Rights, the most dependable pair for long journeys. I've got one called Missouri Compromise, too, and then there's a Supreme Court -- fine, dignified horse, though you do have to push him now and then.
No, siree, it didn't. And it won't -- no matter what happens -- just as long as the folks at the fair believe in freedom and Union. So --  Giddyap, Constitution -- and let's keep going, Mr. Stone.
Daniel! ... You must go to sleep.
Why, of course, Hank -- I've always got time for a neighbor. What's on your mind?
Too bad it didn't happen to Miser Stevens.
That's fair enough, Jabez. Man's got a right to mull things over. We'll drive round again, week or so.
Howdy, Mr. Stone. We've come round to ask you if you made up your mind to join the Grange?
Why, thank you, Tom. I was going to ask you if you thought I could.
Some other time, Stevens.
No, you're not.
Don't say that -- I know it is --
The seventh day of April --
Small? Oh, I see what you mean. Why, they vary.  Now a man like Daniel Webster, if I ever get hold of him, I'd have to build a special box for him and even at that, I imagine, the wing spread would be astonishing.  In your case --
Thanks, Mr. Webster!  To the champion of the whole United States -- Dan'l Webster!
I -- I don't know what you're talking about! I -- I haven't time to listen to all this --
Come right into the parlor, won't you, folks.
Headache -- Squire?
Selectman? Selectman of the village? Me?
Well? Don't a politician have to be?
Now look -- here's a list of the people I invited -- they're all the right kind of people -- or did I miss anybody?
You want me to go around --
Coming.
He only wants you to throw the stick for him, Jabez. I guess he's feeling the spring a-coming, too.
That's wonderful language. It would move a stone.
It's all right, Jabez. We'll find something to pay Stevens.
No, Jabez -- all I need is some rest -- You go and pay our debt. Everything'll be all right then ... everything.
Well -- I -- I don't know -- I would pay our debts and well -- maybe get a new bonnet, but -- really -- I think I would live the same.
Looks right elegant, Mary.
It's very becoming to you, Mr. Selectman.
No, no. I don't want to be idle.
Hello, Jabez --  Here's your son.
He's my son and I like him the way he is. Why do you always have to pick on him? If it's not the boy it's me. You don't like the way I live -- you don't like my friends, or my new house -- or anything.
Jabez!
Sorry, Ma -- but this consar-- this little pig --  He won't let me fix him --
That's right, Ma -- we ain't licked yet. A Stone's never licked till he's dead -- that's what Dad used to say, didn't he, Ma?
I just figgered -- knew you didn't have enough bills.
That's a word you're too free with lately, Jabez, consarn this and consarn that ...
I can't help it. I mean it, I tell you. I've had more than my share. Nothing ever goes right for me -- nothing!
But it's true. Take 'em up in your hands, Mary -- feel 'em -- they're real all right.  Aren't you glad?
I figure that depends a mite on how you get it and how you spend it, Son.
Sure, Ma.
Ma! ...  Where's Mary ... and little Dan'l?
Of course it's all right, son. You had Daniel Webster, didn't ye?  Breakfast's ready!  I've made a special surprise for Mr. Webster.
It's all right, Sheriff.
Let him try it.
Hello, Jabez -- I was just talking to Stevens about a little extension on your payment.
Now, Ma -- You just try to set an example for me, and keep hold of yourself.
Gee, would you, Mr. Webster? Honest?
You've got a smart man, Mrs. Stone. Hang onto him.
Of course not --
You see, I don't care if we are rich or poor -- I don't care if we're big or small, all I care about is Jabez. He was the first man I loved. He never used to care about money -- we were poor as Job's turkey, but none of us minded. Now I've seen him drive the poor from the door, and we used to be poor ourselves. I've seen him get hard and mean, and he isn't hard or mean. I've heard him mock at the church bells -- the bells that rang for our wedding. That's not like him, Mr. Webster -- It must be my fault somehow -- my fault.
I'll do my best, Mary.
Hullooo!
If it's the British Minister, take him around to the pantry and give him some Madeira --
Oh -- it's you again. What do you want?
Pretty good -- that's perfect!
The loneliness? Lonely with all your gold, Mister Stevens? That hardly makes sense.
You can talk to me ...
Why don't you?
Oh, that's what you want -- well, you can be perfectly honest with Jabez Stone -- now.
Do I?  I'm sorry.  You're gonna have to help me, man.  This is my first time driving a limo.
The past six months.
So, why didn't you come?
You mean you thought she wouldn't make it out here and she'd come crawling on back, so why bother to pack?
Mind if I play some tunes?
Just remember that when you sign for the tip.  They're paying for it, so don't be shy.
No, sir.
They don't look happy...something's gone wrong.
Hey, I negotiate million dollar deals for breakfast.  I can handle these clowns.  I want to talk to Hans.  Hans! Sprickenzie talk?
That asshole's not my friend! I barely know him!  I hate his fucking guts --  -- Ellis, for Christ's sake, tell him you don't mean shit to me --
If you'd listened to me he would be neutralized already!
It's useless to you!  There's seven safeguards on our vault, and the code key is only one of them!  You'll never get it open!
I wouldn't think of leaving, Hans. Unless you want to open the front door...?
I'm a cop from New York.
William Clay.  Call me Bill.
Put it down now.
That was Gary Cooper, shithead...
When you're hot, you're hot.
Oh?  What idiot put you in charge?
I'm an exceptional thief, Mrs. McClane. And now that I'm moving up to kidnapping, you should be more polite.
No matter what it did to our marriage -- ?
Can I get you anything?  Food?  Cake? Watered down champagne punch?
I'm ahead of you...partner.
Al, what's wrong?  Did something --  -- Oh, God.  You're coming in!  That's it, isn't it?  Christ, Powell, I told you what you're dealing with here --
I'm here, cowboy.
I...I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to make a joke of it.
Ask the FBI.  They've got the terrorist playbook and they're running it, step by step.
I got it.  But you can tell her yourself.  Just watch your ass and you'll make it.
How do you know?
Who the hell knows?  Maybe he was a stockbroker who looked at the Dow Jones and opted for early retirement!
Yessir.
This is Deputy Chief Robinson.  Who is this?
I never make bets or guesses, that way I'm never wrong and I never have to pay out.
Fuck you, sir - if I'm right, I don't need you.  What I want is - if I make an honest mistake I want help.
Yes, I would.
What about the kids?
Jackie - what are you talking about?
Well, how'll I get home?
I love you.
That's why I can talk to you, as an equal, Sonny.  You got to merge your whole soul with God.  And then you are Him and one with the Holy Ghost.
I never thought I'd get out this way.  I'll tell you.
Yeah.  So how are you?
Yeah... I know.
Where you gonna go?
Howard Johnson's... you're warped. You know that?  You're really warped!
I like that... yeah!
What?
Look... who's on the phone?
All right, enough!  Who the fuck is on the phone... anyway?  Is that you Moretti?  You on the phone?  Will somebody talk to me?
All right!  He didn't do it.  All right?  Now... would you get the fuck off the phone?  I'll bet that really changed them, huh?  Anyway, Leon... did I do it for you?
That's good then.  You've found something.
Do you still want the operation?
I don't know what to say to ya!  I guess I just wanted to say I'll see ya... or whatever.
I can't help it.  I can't stop him from anything.
He won't listen to anybody.  He's been very crazy all summer.  Since June he's been trying to kill me.
He was under great strain: you don't understand, he's a very mixed up person.
It made him crazy - so much demand, he'd fly into this rages.  And I got more depressed than ever; I saw I'd never get the operation.  So I tried to take my life - I swallowed about a half pound of pills ... blues, reds, yellows, downers, uppers, screamers ... you name it. But I just threw them up and wound up in the hospital.  Sonny comes there and looks at me and just says: 'Wow!'  So when I hear he's in the bank, I almost go crazy because I know he's doin' it for me.
I told you -- keep away.  I don't know what we do now.
I'm not alone.
Call me Sonny-boy.
I frisk you?
I don't forget about Sal and the boom boom room.  I want you to see this.
... armed robbery ...
Nothin' doin'.  I give you one hostage when you bring my wife, and one for the helicopter, one for the jet, and the rest can come home on the jet.
Sonny, your wife's on the way ... We reached her ... your wife's on the way ... everything you asked for, you got.
Can't land ... you'd kill people ...
I'm not ... I'm not ... you're gettin' a bus ... you're gettin' a bus ... the jet's comin' into Kennedy ... and your wife's on the way ... what else do you need? What else can I get you?  Listen, I don't know how you can do better ... see that man over there ... the FBI guy ...
What makes you think you'll be able to control it?
Do what the gentleman says, Howard.
Mulvaney...
I got two kids ... and I'd like to see them again.
What are you talking about?  What do you think I'm doin'?  I'm gettin' the ball rollin'.  I'm keeping these people happy ... I'm keeping you happy ... I gotta keep the cops cooled out ... I gotta do everything ... I gotta pay for the pizza ... I'm workin' on it, do you know what I mean?  I'm workin' on it ... Jesus Christ!  I gotta do it all ... I got all the ideas ... you want me to give you the gun?  You want to take it over?
I'll be God damned if you will.
They look like good kids.
Why not?
Little smoke: like a Polish four- alarm fire, is all.
Girls, I wanta apologize.  For my language back there.
You know, you remind me of my 19- year-old brother - only he's got his hair down to his knees - he looks like something that eats berries and roots out of the ground. God forbid I should say something to him like, 'Listen, if you ever smoke marijuana, just remember that it's illegal' and he storms outta the house.  You rob a bank, but you keep your body pure, is that it?
Fuck him - let him out!
Let's go, Sonny.
Ah shit.  Okay... go ahead.  Anybody else have to go?
But do you mean in? ... But you just told him that if worse comes to worse...
But I want to know what you think.
What kind of a deal?
It's nothing - it just goes up - it's the safest thing in the world. Safer than a car.  Don't worry about it, Sal - it'll be all right ... they're great ...
Get over there!
They keep sayin' two homosexuals. I'm not a homosexual.  I want you to stop them saying that.
They gotta stop sayin' that.
Okay.
Okay, Sonny.
I've got a jet.  I'll have airport limousine here in a half hour.  I want the hostages.
You follow my car.
I am.
What is it?  Did you just barge in here... He doesn't have plan.  It's all a whim.  'Rob a bank!  What not?'
Yeah - it looks real official.
Goodbye, honey.  Wish us luck!
My God, Sonny - you oughtta see - Alla Brooklyn is here!  On all 3 networks!
I talked to the FBI, I told them about you, they said if you just come outta the bank it's gonna be okay.
I said you were never a faggot.
What'll you do?  Come out.
No!
No.  This really pissed him off, Sonny.  He says you're dead.  He says he doesn't have a son.
Doing what?

Too long!  Too long.  Now for the life of me, I haven't been able to figger this out.  Either dem Koreans are geniuses or we Blacks are dumb.
No!
I wasn't trying to be a hero.  I saw what was about to happen and I reacted, didn't even think.  If I did, I might not have done it in second thought.  Da Mayor is an old man, haven't run that fast in years.

I know.
I know so.  He, them, they're not to be trusted.
Tell Vito.
Here, take the broom.  The front needs sweeping.
Yeah, no more ninety-minute deliveries around the corner.
Mookie, you're fucking up.
Pop, what else can I say?  I don't wanna be here, they don't want us here.  We should stay in our own neighborhood, stay in Bensonhurst.
'Bout time, Pop.
I'm gonna kill somebody today.
Tell 'em, Pop.
Good, make sure he don't jerk around.
Yeah, you are. He touched you. You're "it" until you touch someone else.

I'm fine.
Po, po, position...? Hey, here's thought, have you a bathroom?
Very good. Back in a jiff.
What? No! Look.
Of course, she's in on it too. Don't let her see you. Just go get that chest and show the world what Collins has been doing. I'm staying here.
I know I am, Mom.
Maybe the treasure's a chest full of apples and bananas!
Is it okay if he spends the night?
Cool.
You're it.
Why not?
Shift to your left.
Can we eat there tomorrow?
Who's Captain Rob?
Exactly! A pirate!
Will not.
You look familiar. Did I have your brother?
Okay. Anyone else have any questions?
Oh, no. You're not gettin' me again.
What a nerd. I don't know where that girl's ever gonna find a husband.
Duh. The cool kids sit in the back of the bus. Here, every row is in the back. We're all cool!
You and me? Dream on, desperado.
Just wanted to see how your doing.
Go away, assface.
Yeah, that's why I asked.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
I lugged it all over town!
How could she miss this? This whole salute to Collins was her idea.
He's so modest. Probably embarrassed by all the attention.
Right.
Damn! What are the odds?
Hey, where'd you go?
Dietician! This interview is over. You can have the camera back tomorrow. Come by the classroom. Heller heads off.
That's not your tape.

Oh, go on.

We're not crazy. We're "special". PRINCIPAL COLLINS wants us to have our own classroom!
No, it actually fit quite nicely.  Well, except for the fact that it wasn't really as long as it was wide.
Damn right I did it. Went back and set the house on fire, his little floozy testified in court - and I ended up doing ten years at Rikers, got my teeth knocked out by Mike the Dyke.
We start our own class?
What?
The chest! The chest that I put my papers in.
No you don't know who stole it. Just let me do the thinking.
Why don't you see to it the kids are ready for the parade tomorrow. I have to pay somebody a little visit.
Yes. So as soon as Zimmer shows up, we'll get our check and blow this pop stand before anyone finds out anything.

The spice must flow... the spice has given me accelerated evolution for four thousand years... it has enabled you to live two hundred years... the spice helps make the sapho juice, which gives the red-lipped mentats the ability to be living computers... the secret side of spice... the water of life.
That's it... spice mining... no other cloud quite like it. See the spotters over it? They're watching for wormsign... the telltale sand waves. Seismic probes on the surface, too Sire... worms can travel too deep for their waves to show... Looks like a good patch of spice.
I'm sorry Gurney.
Is this what you seek?
Yes. I sensed the play in you lad, but this can no longer be play. Tomorrow we leave for Arrakis! Arrakis is real. The Harkonnens are real.
They said you were dead.  They said...
Your Reverence.
You and your Bene Gesserit sisterhood... I'm not your Kwisatz Haderach...  I'm something different, something unexpected!  I'm a seed.  I am so much more...  You don't begin to know me...
Yes...
I am a servant of the His Majesty the Emperor. I have served His Majesty on Arrakis long enough for my eyes to change.
Where there is spice and spice mining there are always worms.
Always.
To protect their territory. Vibrations attract them. -- PAUL  I've registered him now... a knife is a sheath on his left arm... He's strong... a person born to command... He's hiding many things.  Is there a relationship between the worms and the spice?
Greater than treasure, Usul.  We have thousands of such caches.  Only a few of us know them all.  When we have enough... we shall change the face of Arrakis. Listen!...
Too bad... thought they were Harkonnen.
Long live the fighters!
SILENCE... SILENCE.
You feel the flesh crisping?
What can be done has been done.
My father sent you to test me. Music then?
No.  I never drink -- wine.
I don't want anything.  I'm just a really big, big fan.  I've seen all your movies.
Because I'm planning on dying soon.
Don't you bave a car?
Do you want me to get it for you?
Don't worry.  I do it every Halloween.
Of course!  Dracula requires <u>presence</u>.  It's all in the voice, and the eyes, and the hand --
BULLSHIT!  I am ready now!  Roll the camera!!
Hmm... my biggest hit?  That would probably be "Dracula."
Dracula?
"Oh, tract housing, huh?"  Laugh. "You need a new real estate agent."
So how'd we do?
So why didn't you do it?
This'll look a lot better.  We have to match the stock footage of the octopus underwater.
Once you're in it, it warms up.
Huh?
Don't let me slow you down.
Isn't it wonderful?  After all these years, the press is showing an interest again in Bela Lugosi.
Yeah, she's really somethin'.
I don't know.  Where?
Yes!  I've dreamed of it for years, but your movie made me realize I've got to take action.  GOODBYE, PENIS!
And once I'm a woman, Jean-Claude and I are getting married --
What do you mean?
Ah.  The director of "Glen Or Glenda."
I made it up.  It's horseshit!
Cris, you made it.  Thanks a lot.
Isn't he?
What?
Better than not getting a job?
Of course it is.  And that's why you should play the part.
Some weirdo who likes to wear dresses.
But Ed, we're not even married.  And you don't have a job.
Dolores, don't you understand?  I'm a director now!  I made "Glen Or Glenda."  Directing <u>is</u> my day job.
That's a good reason to dump your girlfriend.
Does she have room for me?
Ed, it's over.  I need a normal life.
Perhaps a small amount of money.  How much do one of your motion pictures cost?
What other sixty-thousand?
You misunderstood.  I gave you everything I have in the world: Three-hundred dollars.
That's not true --
Well, uh, if I could I would...
Nobody in town has seen it, so I'm givin' you first crack at my talents.
But Bela Lugosi's in it!
Ah!  Atomic Age stuff, huh?  I like it.  I'll tell you what, Mr. Ward.  Why don't you leave those film cans, and my associates and I will take a look at your little opus.  Maybe we can do business together.
Mr. Wood, you have bounced your third and final rent check.
Graverobbers from <u>what</u>??
Mm, not good-lookink enough.
But what bout accent?  Some people tink I haf too much accent.
But Tor, it's a starring part! You're second billed.
Nonsense!  You must try our hot glug.
We're escaping!
Ugh, I hate when that happens.
It is when it works.  You know the one film of mine I can stand to watch?  "Kane."  The studio hated it... but they didn't get to touch a frame.  Ed, visions are worth fighting for. Why spend your life making someone else's dreams?
So you're not gonna make the movie?
Fuck no!  But there's a poster.
Well, Mr. Weiss, I'm your guy.  I work fast, and I'm a deal: I write AND direct.  And I'm good.  I just did a play in Hollywood, and Victor Crowley praised its realism.
Are you a fruit?
So you're not a fruit?
Yeah.  I know what it's like to live with a secret, and worry about what people are gonna think of you... My girlfriend still doesn't know why her sweaters are always stretched out.
So change the poster.  Trust me, you'll be better off.  This is a story that's gonna <u>grab</u> people.  It's about this guy.  He's crazy about this girl but he likes to wear dresses.  Should he tell her? Should he not tell her?  He's torn. George, this is DRAMA.
I know a guy in Universal's stock house -- he's giving me the footage for free.  This movie's gonna look like a million bucks.
This is my thirteenth pair.
What do you mean?
Okay?
Bela died.
Well you tried --
Do you want your buttons on the left or the right?
Hell, if I did, I wouldn't have any friends.
Ed, you're gonna miss your own premiere.
<u>Right now</u>.  Let's drive to Vegas!
No.  I think my film is perfect for you.
No!  I don't want you to show the movie, I want you to be <u>in it</u>!  See, maybe I should explain: We started shooting, but then after three days we got shut down.  So we're having a backers party, to raise some more money.  Perhaps you'd like to come next door and meet some of the backers...?
You don't wanna be noticed?
What's uncanny?
Uh, I couldn't reach the guy... he was in meetings all day.  But this'll be great, I promise!
What octopus motor?
Well I was thinkin' like, when Bela played "Fu Manchu."
I do.
Doesn't this strike you as a bit morbid?
You know, you're a very attractive girl.
Anything good?
No.
Al!!
What?
You're nuts.
What do you mean "they're gonna have him die?"
Could we just talk alone for a second? I --
You said a woman likes to be pursued.
You know, everything you asked me to do I did. I call you for advice about Shari you say -  "Leave her be, see other people for a while." You just wanted me to get involved with Jill because it made for a better show.
No. You screwed up my life just so you could get higher ratings. You never gave a shit about me.
Cynthia, I think you're laboring under a misconception. You seem to believe that because you happened to predict this, we should be impressed. We're not. Anybody in any business can predict failure. 1 need people who prevent failure. I want to see this thing turned back in the right direction. Remember this was your baby.
Yes?
What about him -- did he suffer any or was it quick? I'd hate to think he...
Tell me.
Yeah. You did good. What's wrong?
Right, right...
Do you want us to come in the kitchen?
I don't know. She's living with that "entertainer"...
But what was that whole story about him and a nurse?
It was horrible. He called me up.
The doctor said you were having sex.
Why? How...
Well, he's the only one in America who doesn't!
Ma...
I'm sorry. Where'd they send her?
Not too good. That's why it states in your contract that if you do not continue to live a normal life, you're in violation and are liable for the station's financial losses. Ed, I urge you to reconsider. I urge you on behalf of all those people out there whose lives have become so entwined with yours. Play fair with them, Ed.
Welcome to work, Ed.
I hear the dog really liked him.
Hey, believe me -1 know I've got a great chance of making a fool of myself, here.
So maybe this is my dynamite.
Yeah.
Really?
The what?
Oh yeah.
That's lucky.
Ed... I think we should stop seeing each other.
Who cares? I don't ca -- No. I do care.  Shame on everybody. Shame on you! Well, just the seventy-one percent. The other...
Come on, let's go.
Somewhere.
Come on...
Are you all right?
...yeah?
What?
It's nice.
What do we have to do?
So act now. Here's Ed's home phone number.
What are you drunk?
All right. Let me ask you something... are you happy like this?
She didn't know he was a criminal. They had a relationship. They --
Great.
It's me, Ed.
You watching the ballgame?
It's the receptionist at one of the places I service video equipment -- she's very pretty and, you know, she never even talks to me and then today I come in and she's all "I saw you on TV the other night... You were so great ... " Next thing I know we're ...
Stop? I'm a guy. I don't stop. The woman's supposed to stop. We're the gas, they're the brakes.
You brought the cameras here!
Yeah. My problem is I've got a brother who writes a sentence like "We grew up in a small, little bedroom." As opposed to a big, little bedroom?
A hundred per cent cotton. Okay, here we go, Andy.
It's Ed.
The whole time? Eighteen years?
So you saw me on TV and you said "Hey, let me jump on this."
What...
Do you still have it?
What?... Why?
Hi.
That's the point -- this could change things.
That's the whole point. It's all in my head; it's right here.  I just got to get it out there. Tracy wants me to write it so she can read it.  It's beautiful.
He ended up moving back to Milwaukee to live with his parents. I haven't heard from him in a long time. Poor guy. I warned him.
Fine. You know. We just went to Crossroads.
Tammy,  now we've come to a decision. He just think it would be best --
Yeah?
But, Mr. M. -
Yes, I do.
Thanks, Mr. M.
...the rules of conduct determined by a culture at a...
As far as I know, they--
I don't know what you're referring to, but I do know that if certain older and wiser people hadn't acted like such little babies and gotten all mushy, everything would be okay.
Hello, Tracy.
Well, I got in everywhere I applied, but Cornell is my first choice.
Anywhere you want.  Just so long as we're not gone more than a half-hour.
That sounds good.
Yes?
Doing what?
Nooo.  I just thought...  l mean, I am looking for a new car.  But I just thought, well, I'm going away soon, and you'll be stuck here and, I don't know, I just think maybe if things had been different we might have been, well, friends. Real friends.  And then things would be different.  Don't you think?
My house.
Swallows, unsure what heaven or hell awaits him.
Would you sign it for me?
Take as much room as you want
You will.
Walt, we can't throw her out of the election just because we don't like her speech.  That's not what student government's about.
Uh, Jim?
Okay, Jim. I understand.
Just wait outside. Tammy.
I did it.
Okay.  Give me the drill.
Dave.
No, I... uh, didn't know that
Still clear?
We'll let it run awhile
Me?  I took advantage of you?  You hugged me!  You kissed me!  You're the one who --
Yeah.
Yeah, no, she's a go-getter, all right.
Larry, you just take it easy
I'm not like you.
I'm not a dyke, okay, and we're not in love. We were just... I was just experimenting.
I know.
For what?
What do you mean?
Well, I mean, you know, I talked to him and everything, but he just said he thought it was a good idea... and how there's all different kinds of fruit and...  It's nothing against you, Tracy. You're the best.  I just thought --
Good luck to you too, Paul.
You know, I don't understand why everybody bad-mouthed Tracy all the time.  She was always super- nice to me.
Don't you fucking knock?
Paul, get out!
Oh.  Hi, Tammy.  I was just, you know, I went to all your teachers and got your assignments.
What's it to you?
What do you want, Mr. Policeman?
Are you sorry she's dead?
That's right.  Our motives are selfish, so we're cooperating.
When they deserve it.
You look better than Veronica Lake.  Now, <u>Pierce Patchett</u>.
Are you asking me for a date or an appointment?
When I was ten, my old man threw a bottle at my mother.  I guess I got in the way.
Yeah.  But not for long.
You gonna tell me what happened with you and Exley?
So tell me about it.
And for good reason judging from what I know of your background.
It would've happened years ago if you hadn't carried him.  Why the loyalty, Wendell?
You have your extracurricular secrets, I have mine.  We'll hold a clarification session soon.  For now, I need your fearsome old habits at the Victory Motel. We're going to brace a man who may know who killed Jack Vincennes. Can I count on you?
What was that boyfriend's name?
Look at a picture for me.
Yeah.  A great big one.
Get the fuck away from me.
It'll look like justice.  That's what that fat fuck got.  <u>Justice</u>.
They didn't find the shotguns. They planted them.
Patchett uses a lot of ex-cop muscle.
He had help getting up there.  Two of his fingers are broken.
At least not anymore.
We should check the records, and, we should talk to Lynn.
Me?  You called it.  I got a message that...
He no longer works for me.  Find Susan's killer, Mr. White. I'll give you a handsome reward. <u>Whatever you desire</u>.
Wait.  Our deal still holds?
And you fuck people up for a living.  That don't make me you. <u>Capisce</u>, shitbird?
His file listed you as a known associate.  Now spill.
I got a few Nite Owl questions.
Anything off.  Anything that didn't make sense.
It looks like she was flailing, trying to get away.
The public demands justice, sir. This was a full-fledged riot of policemen.  Shift the guilt to men whose pensions are secured.  Force them to retire.  But someone has to swing.  Indict, try and convict Stensland and Bud White.  Secure them jail time.  Feed them to the sharks, sir.  Protect yourself; protect the department.
I don't have time.  I have --
You ain't woofin' I did.  Stupid down home niggers got no more sense than a fuckin' dog.
Nobody.  At least not yet.
I'm happy to cooperate.  You don't need to tie me down.
Alright.  We'll drop that line for now.  Next topic.  Please comment on Pierce Patchett.
Yes, Dudley.  I am.
Edmund, you don't want it and you can't have it.
She may still be alive, whoever she is.
What?
You make a mistake?
Rollo was a purse snatcher.  My father ran into him off duty.  He shot my father six times and got away clean.  No one even knew who he was.  I made the name up to give him some personality.
A third.  I don't think we can make a case without Bud White.
What's Fleur-de-Lis?
Bud White's been here?
He said you were smart.  He also said you were competing with your dead father.  How did he put it? Trying to measure up to a ghost.
You want to know what Bud's like in bed?
I don't hate White.  I really don't.  It's just, in my business, it's the wild cars you have to watch out for.
You cut to the heart of things, don't you?  What about Lynn Bracken?  She going to be a hooker all her life?
Forget everything else for a second, Lynn.  Is there anything you can give me on Dudley Smith?
None.  Call it a hunch.
The proof had his throat slit.  So far you're not denying it.
What's Dudley's scheme?
When was the last time you saw her, Mrs. Lefferts?
Officer White?
Karen, this is Sid Hudgeons from <u>Hush-Hush</u> magazine.
Is she?
I need an extra fifty.  Two patrolmen at twenty apiece and a dime for the watch commander at Hollywood Station.
Stand there with your camera. I'll stop here so you get Grauman's Chinese in the backgrouns.
Yeah, it's subtle.
Sid, it's Vincennes.
What's wrong, Trash?
I put Reynolds in the cab myself. The night cost me a hundred scoots and I got bupkis.
I just called it.
Dope, liquor, hookers that look like movie stars.  Pierce Patchett has it all.
Maybe you should have thought of that before you made Bloody Christmas page one.
Brill's dead. He died of small pox when he was two and he was buried in a Kansas field.  My name doesn't matter.
Nothing.
I'm telling you, I--
Don't know. Did you check everywhere? Maybe it was hidden in something. Maybe there was someone else--
Who are you calling?!
Turn on CNN.
Do it!
Clear as day.
When can you get it here?
Except for the part about my setting up a company in Zurich and knowing anyone named Sam Vollotti and having any relationship whatsoever with the Gambino family.
I don't know who he is.
Who are they?
They're spooks.
Look, you gave me some work over the last year. We'll call it even.
They froze your accounts. Get outa my way.
If you find something, chalk the Baltimore Sheraton mailbox and go to Temperanceville. It's South of Salisbury.  And take this.
And you were worried about me. That's nice, I appreciate--
We said a hundred.
What do you mean?
You used to work for 'em, didn't you?
How'd you have the manpower to--
Why'd you leave?
Yeah.
<u>Here</u>?!
'Kay, well, could you walk faster, please.
They shouldn't have come without calling first.
That wasn't so hard.
Tell him we're not gonna hurt him.
What if we just fucked with 'em?
No.
How fast can you learn?
I know my phone number and I know the number for SportsPhone. Beyond that--
Is Jerry Delsano in?
Law enforcement?
Oh my God.
Hello. Hello, Maria.
You got any money?
Eight.  Size eight.
Thanks.
Daniel's life is already ruined. Maybe if you guys stopped thinking about yourselves for a change and--
What kind of trouble.
Not that I could see.
<u>Yes</u>, for my wife, what the hell kinds of questions are these.
Not a very good one, but--
Just for the criminals.
Right.
In front of Harrison's, he got hit by a bus. I knew him. The firm did some pro bono work for his organization a few years back.
There's just, clearly, some administrative snafu. I'm sure this is the worst of it.
How could you let me find out like this?
"At the center of the investigation are well-known Washington-area attorneys Robert Dean and Rachel Banks."
Stacy--
I'm looking at a picture of you and Rachel taken <u>yesterday</u>.
My father's put me in touch with an attorney. He'll be--
Yes.
Just reporters.
Stacy--
That was for Christmas.
That's gonna end tonight.
It's a brand new card.
Sir?
That's not you having a whiskey sour with Carmine Morada.
Brill.
That wasn't the answer I was hoping for.
Someone with whom you don't have quite so personal a--
Why?
Will you hang on just a second.
Bullshit.
What're you gonna do, Rachel? You gonna sit in a bar in Baltimore? You want your job back? You want a life?
We'd rather not--
I got a call this morning from a source I trust. The Post is running a lead this afternoon about your involvement in the Bellmoth investigation.
This is <u>bullshit</u>. Someone's mixing up a bunch of half-truths to ruin me and to ruin my case.
Maybe Bellmoth. Maybe the unions. I don't know.
That's because your Union bosses <u>are</u> those Guido mother-fuckers.
Mr. Dean--
No. We're never getting a divorce. We were having a fight. It happens sometimes.
Did you take <u>anything</u>--anything at all--out of those Christmas bags I brought home last week.
You've got a bunch of Armani suits, they didn't take 'em?
Bobby--
Rachel's dead?
Go fuck yourself.
Yeah.
How can I reach you?
The police?
You remember Daniel Zavitz?
Yes sir.
You didn't ask me to meet you 30 miles from my office for a Bible study class.
You're gonna finger me as soft on terrorism? <i>Terrorism,</i> you unconscionable asshole?
There was a transfer.
He never made it to the newspaper, but there was private sector contact.
Get it.
Destroy his credibility before he goes public. Neutralize him. I don't want anyone listening to a word he has to say. Tell me about Rachel Banks.
I just meant--
Dean's with Lyle.
So they know everything.
And if it wasn't?
The fuck do you have goin' on with Sam Albert?
I also have tiny pizzas and mushrooms stuffed with--
What kind of fossils?
I don't want to go back.
What do you mean, poetry?
See what's happening to them - the stars.
I'm not agreeing.  Don't think I'm agreeing, because I'm not.
No.
Don't talk.
Listen to me, Katharine.  You've broken your ankle and I'm going to have to try and bind it.  I think your wrist might be broken, too - and some ribs, which is why it's hurting you to breathe.  I'm going to have to walk to El Taj.  Given all the traffic in the desert these days I should bump into one army or another before I reach there - or Fenelon-Barnes and his camel.  And then I'll be back and we'll be fine, and I'll never leave you.
You too.  Good luck!
Appropriate?
I haven't, no.  Sorry.
No, I'm not thinking clearly - I need a doctor too, to come with me, can I take this vehicle?  I'll pay, of course - and some morphine and  Seventy miles - I can be back here by dusk.
What?
No!  NO!  Don't radio anybody, just give me the fucking jeep!
Her hands and feet were tied.
Cut the ropes.  I left a note, on his blanket.  At the next Geographical Society I shall await with great interest the announcement of the Fenelon-Barnes Slave Knot.  The Girl wouldn't leave, of course.  Her father had sold her for a camel. He turns over the propeller, the engine cranks up.
What do we find in the desert? Arrow heads, spears.  In a war, if you own the desert, you own North Africa.
Good, we're all here?  A toast, to the International Sand club - may it soon resurface.
I told you so.
No.
I keep explaining.  You've got the wrong man.  My name is Bellini - Antonio Bellini.  Bellini, Caravaggio, both painters, I think that is confusing you.
Don't cut me.
Oh Jesus.  Oh Jesus Christ.
I met your friend Mary.  She said I should stop and see if you were okay. Apparently we're neighbors - my house is two blocks from yours in Montreal. Cabot, north of Laurier.  Bonjour.
So was my Patient.
I understand you were in Africa. Whereabouts?
All over?  I kept trying to cover a very modest portion and still failed.  Are you leaving us?  Now's our opportunity to swap war wounds.
Are you planning to be the exception?
I can't hide anymore.  I breathe like a dog.  I lose my balance.  Stealing's got harder. Caravaggio stares at the Herodotus.
I don't even know if it is my book. The Bedouin found it in the plane, in the wreckage.  It's mine now. I heard your breathing and thought it might be rain. I'm dying for rain - of course I'm dying anyway - but I long to feel rain on my face.
I don't know.  Paper.  Is it? Paper?  I don't remember.
I've had a drink.  Fatal.
You can't kill me.  I died years ago.
Have to return the favor - take a few photographs for the army.
I can already see.
Why are people always so happy when they collide with someone from the same place?  What happened in Montreal when you passed a man in the street - did you invite him to live with you?
Just go off.  I'll be quite all right.
Well then - yes.  Of course.
He came back, he says he caught a rabbit.  I'm cooking it.
Sikh.  If he wears a turban, he's a Sikh.
Condensed milk - one of the truly great inventions.
Hey! -
You'd better be.
Never heard of it.
The Germans were here.  The Germans were all over this area.  They left mines everywhere.  Pianos were their favorite hiding places.
Is something funny?
I've done this.  I've had to do this.
I promise you that was the right thing to do.  He's my good luck.  Now cut.  This one.  I hope we don't die.
Yes.  Later.
I try not to expect you.
I'll ask the Lieutenant.  But thank you.
Sorry.  I took a Benzedrine.
I'd like to spend a night with you in a bed.
I'm feeling old.
Don't move!  Stand ABSOLUTELY STILL! Hana stops.
This is making me incredibly angry.
How awful.  What will you do?
Coming.  I can't sleep.  I woke up shouting in the middle of the night. Geoffrey thinks it's the thing in the desert, the trauma.
- The Wonder House comma as the natives called the Lahore Museum.
What have I been doing all this time? Do you know how many mines I've seen? - more mines than there are soldiers, more - how many mines we've put in the ground ourselves, stuffed in corpses, dropped out of the sky.  And now this.
Go on, do it.  I don't need to hear any more.
I hardly knew the guy. Why be impolite to strangers?
Through a window.
Bingo.
Give me a break. Remember Manzini? When he stole Montezuma's scepter he left a Pepto Bismal bottle. The best ones always copy Mac.
Exactly.
With that computer--nobody better. Out there...it's different. You twisted your ankle stepping over a curb on Madison Avenue.
How would you approach him? Hello, Mr. MacDougal, I'm Gin, would you steal a painting with me?
He's on to something bigger.
No you can't.
Where did you hear that, one of those American talk shows?  Check, please.
Of course you wouldn't. The Rembrandt wouldn't fit.
Oh, that's quite all right. No charge.
We were, we are, but this is perfect for you.
So you've heard all those stories about me. Well, I can assure you they're not true. And if they were true, I've retired.
Possibly.
If I can't trust you to pick up a painting, how can I trust you about the Mask?
I'm just curious what sort of security system you'd have in your own house.
I guess I have a more optimistic view of human nature than you do.
Good morning.
In a week.
They're having a farewell party the last night. Before the Mask goes back to Taiwan.
Look, I can help. You need a sensor expert. You've got one.
You're too easily impressed with yourself. I believe I've made that point before.
No one <u>needs</u> anything except food and shelter. The rest we just want.
Bookshelf. Sensors--
In eye of that painting.
It's a party.
Duh.
The Mask.
A billion dollars.
There's food in the fridge. I won't be long.
I'd taken the Mask?
My job, my rules.
Transfer.
Guest lists of every A-list party on turnover night. They'd be handy to disappear into, so we're invited to all of them.
We're doing it tonight.
There's no way to practice this. And no time. Besides, I've planned it all. There aren't any surprises.
Can't be too careful.
Have really held you under?
Seen one billion, seen them all.
They drive so recklessly there.
FUCKING THING!!!
You should know, when I come back here with the Mask--if anything goes wrong, a detailed description of everything you've done goes to the PRC.
Next time I'll use valet parking.
Yeah, the lord of the manor doesn't haul his own groceries.
Had to get a liquid plasma screen.
This better be worth 1t.
The early bird gets the damn worm.
Check out my ball.
It's not just art, it's history. Something you Americans don't care about--because you haven't got any.
You got a real problem with priorities, you know that?
We wear so many goddam masks after a while they get stuck to our faces, you know? And they don't come off. But when you find the one person who really knows you, and then you lose her...
Probably not.
Yeah?  I should learn to do stuff like that. They make the place feel real homey.
Yeah, I'm real glad you brought that up.  I was going through your file here, and I ran into these medical records.  They kinda surprised me --
Yeah, I can see that.  I guess the only thing that confused me is - - not that your medical problems aren't important, but -- how come the files about them are in with all the real estate stuff?
The what?
I thought the same thing, right off the bat. That's why we went to see the doctor.  But hunh-uh.  Turns out one's got nothing to do with the other.
It was right up on the PG&E property over there.
I know.  But the toxicologist I been talking to?  He gave me a list of problems that can come from hexavalent chromium exposure. And everything you all have is on that list.
<u>Settle down</u>?  I got 74 bucks to my name, Mr. Masry!  I can't <u>afford</u> to settle down!
I don't need pity.  I need a paycheck.  And I've looked, but when you've spent the last six years raising babies, it's real hard to convince someone to give you a job that pays worth a damn.  So I figure, since you're the one who said I was gonna be okay, you should be the one to hire me.
I'm <u>not</u> everyone else, Mr. Masry.  I'm someone you made promises to that you didn't deliver on.  I trusted you.  With my kids' well-being.  Now, I'm smart, and I'm hard- working, and I'll do anything.  But if you think I'm leaving here without a job, you got another thing coming.
I was wondering -- could you tell me who I'd talk to about maybe getting an advance on my paycheck?  Just -- for the weekend.
I don't wanna take your money, Mr. Masry.
I don't know.  Maybe cause you look like someone who has a lot of fun.
It doesn't take a genius to look at those medical records and think something's wrong.
So far.  But that place is a pig sty.  I wouldn't be surprised if there's more.
Erin --
Well -- I found one document at the water board that had a toxic test well reading from 1967.  A hell of a lot of people have lived on that land since then.
Kinda like David and what's-his-name?
Another raise wouldn't hurt.  And with all the time I'm gonna be spending on the road, I'll probably be needing my own cel phone, won't I?
They're trying to intimidate us.  Tell them to wait in the conference room.
I don't know.  Big.  Dark.
No, Ed -- what with me running for my life, I didn't have time to check those things --
Yeah.  Yeah, I'm ... fine.
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to put you on hold for just one second here --  Do you mind?
Fuck you.  Make time.  Cause I bust my ass for you.  I watch everything else in my life go straight in the toilet, for you.  And what do you do for me?  Huh?  You see the way I'm treated around here -- but have you ever stood up for me once?  Have you ever mentioned to everyone what good work I'm doing?  Have you ever bothered saying, hey, Erin doesn't get paid the most cause she has the best tits; she gets paid the most cause she's the best God damn employee I've ever had?
I want my paycheck.  By the end of the day.
And it's less than pocket change for PG&E.
It's eight million dollars, Erin.  Eight million dollars.
Reasons PG&E thinks it shouldn't go to --
He's got a reputation for doing all his --
Bullshit.  It was a misunderstanding.  But instead of handling it politely, instead of treating her with respect --
Erin, it's just a meeting.
With nothing linking it to the corporate offices yet, I'd say we'll end up on the lower end of that.  Still a lot of money.
<u>I know</u>.  We're having a meeting, it's all set up --
Because Kurt doesn't want to work with you. He thinks you're a loose cannon.
Erin --
Oh, now don't get all jealous, Ed.  I got a little something for you, too.
"I can always find someplace else to work. Someplace that'll pay me a fortune and give me a view of the French Riviera ..."
Take it.
Yesterday.
That's right.
Well, believe it or not, I am on the prowl for some water records.
Have you been to the water board?
Oh, come on, where's your sense of adventure?  We're going someplace you never been before.
Yup.  They must be important, too, cause they came on a special plane.
In the conference --
Everyone's.  This is a lawsuit.  We need to be able to contact the plaintiffs.
That's all you got, lady.  Two wrong feet. In fucking ugly shoes.
You need help with your kids?  I could probably do that.
I was serious before, you know.  If you need someone to keep an eye on them -- after school or something -- I don't have a job now, so I'm around in the afternoons.
Are you this hard on everyone who tries to help you?
Yeah, we'll just see about that, won't we?
Fixing a leak under your sink.
Well, I'm sure as hell not what I thought I was gonna be.  I was supposed to have one of those great lives, with everything all laid- out and perfect.  I mean, hell -- I was Miss Wichita, for God's sakes.  Did I tell you that?  You live next door to a real live beauty queen.  I still got the tiara.  I kept it cause I thought it meant something.  I thought it meant I was gonna do something great with my life.  I thought it proved I was gonna grow up to be someone.
I didn't say that.
What do you want, a joke?
Just a few more minutes, then we can go.  Take her, will you?
Hi.  It's me.  I got a favor to ask you.
You know me.  I pick things up real fast.
We'll just be a minute.  Get a little more sleep.
I will.  Bye.
What's going on?
Have you been logging on?
Yes?
Alert all commands.  Calculate every possible destination along their last known trajectory and disburse the fleet to search for them.  Don't fail me again, Admiral, I've had quite enough!
Much anger in him, like in his father.
This one I have watched a long time.  All his life has he looked away ... to the horizon, to the sky, to the future.  Never his mind on where he was, on what he was doing.  Adventure, excitement ...  A Jedi craves not these things!
He's too old.  Yes.  Too old to start the training.
The boy is our last hope.
And that is why I must go.
Growls a reserved greeting.
What's wrong with him?
I'm sure I'll see you again, too. Keep well.  You'd better chain him until it's over.
Barks his agreement.
Barks his agreement.
Away put your weapon.  I mean you no harm.
Can't get your ship out?  Have you tried?  Have you tried?
I'm not looking for a friend. I'm looking for a Jedi Master.
You know the Jedi Master?
Then I'll see you in Hell.
There is a grave disturbance in The Force.
There isn't a hint of life in the area.  But all the perimeter markers are set, so you'll know if anyone comes calling.
The Empire won't look for you out here.  I'd say you're all set ... which means it's time for me to get going.
I understand.  A death mark is not an easy thing to live with ... Until our paths cross again, may the force be with you.
What is it?
Go tell your precious Princess ... Luke is dead unless he shows up soon.
I do hope he's all there ... if you take my meaning.  I would hate to see Master Luke develop a short circuit ...
I'm going to see what it is.
Good.  Soon as we're clear, we'll kick this baby into hyperdrive.
Me?  I don't know what you mean.
And what are they, pray tell?
And you think you're the one to apply some heat?
Wait, don't open it ... that's one of the traps for the ice creatures.
To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?
They're just trying to see if they can stir something up ... we're safe.
Afraid of?  Certainly not you Captain Solo ... or any other man in this galaxy.
Try and control this ...
There will be more of them.  They always travel in groups.  And there's nothing they like better than to attach themselves to ships. Just what we need right now.
Oh, so sorry!  Didn't mean to offend your droid.  You think braking and shutting down in that amount of time is easy?
Never heard of that system.
A mining colony.
Let Ôer go, Chewie.
I'm worried about all of us.  I can't figure out what they're up to.
Now don't get the wrong idea, pal. She was just trying to express her true feelings for me.
No hard feelings?
Repairs ...
You will find them well enough. But they must never again leave this city.
Good.  It would be most unfortunate if I had to leave a permanent garrison here.
Not really.
You're part of the mining guild then?
You've probably never done an honorable thing in your life.
Luke!
Why not me?
Size has no meaning.  It matters not.  Look at me.  Judge me by my size do you?
I thought those seekers were set for stun!
They're a lot stronger than I'm used to.
But I feel The Force flowing!
Free your mind and return he will.
It is the future you see.
Foreknowledge is helpful, but painful sometimes and dangerous too.  You have far to go in your training.
Time will tell.
No! .... Never ....
Yes, sir.  We're in luck.  The sick bay's almost empty except for a mauled fox cub, a deer with pneumonia, and a depressed gorilla. The Apes will be hidden from the public.  They'll be quarantined. If they want medical attention, it's available on the spot.  And the experts can start giving them the once-over first thing in the morning. General Brody's very pleased.
My name is Cornelius.  And this is Zira -- my wife.
Dr. Milo, please don't call my wife mad.
And we can watch ...
No -- clothes.  Stevie, they changed into them.
Security.  Join the Marines and see the Zoo ...
With particular emphasis on the cranial and oral areas.
Heavy Third World connections. They get weapons, drugs, fuel, choppers - everything is pumped into the island from the south.
C'mon, Snake - it's L.A. Everything's phony, you know that.
Now go get dressed. We have things to do.
Go on now. Do as I say.
We'll see.
You're stalling, Eddie.  Talk, you little gringo!
Don't lie to me.
You want to stay here, while Cuervo Jones rules the world?
Can you land?
My name is no longer Carjack. Will you please get that through your fucking head?
You assholes didn't bring me here to give me this for 20 years of dedicated service. What'ya want?
So what's the deal, huh? Go into L.A., find the President's daughter, secure the box, and bring 'em both out - and I'm free?
Having second thoughts?
You don't understand. It's already in you.
I guess we have a deal. Nice to be working with you, Plissken.
Cahuenga Pass. Make your way up through the mountains toward the Hollywood Bowl. You should be able to pick up Utopia's tracer there.  Once you go inside, you're on your own.  You know what you have to do with the girl, don't you?  We have to spare this nation her trial - for treason.
Let's just say it's what's best for the country.
A medical team will be standing by.
I'm here.
I give you my word. Put the prototype into my hands, and you're a free man.
All right. Anything for you, Snake.  Although I was going to take you to Cuervo Jones' place.
Oh, man... You didn't have to hit me, Snake. I can help you.
I could've helped you. We coulda made a deal with Cuervo. If you'd listen...
Looking to get out.
Yeah. So how do I get to Venice?
Who?
The Surgeon General of Beverly Hills.
You need help.
The what?
He heard Lady Guenevere's request and he said nothing. That is all.
Move aside!
So be it, to the death.
Lancelot, I will save you... Don't die.
Ready my knights for battle; they will ride with their King once more. I have lived through others far too long! Lancelot carried my honor and Guenevere my guilt. My knights have fought my causes. Mordred carries my sins. Now, at last, I will rule.
You are the son of King Uther, and the fair Igrayne... you are King Arthur.
That's not why you came.
Yes, yes, I know that. Everybody does. Lord Leondegrance is my only ally among the barons and the great knights. I can't lose him.
Because you must! You and only you. Have you forgotten that it was you who freed Excalibur?
There are maidens as fair, and fairer than Guenevere. If I put my mind to it, I could see them now, many of them, weeping for love of you, watching the hills for you coming from the high towers of their castles. Offering you their every favor. Rich, clever--but if it is to be Guenevere, so be it.
Then answer me this. For years peace has reigned in the land. Crops grow in abundance, there is no want. Every one of my subjects enjoys his portion of happiness and justice, even those whose tiresome misunderstandings we must resolve here each day. Tell me, Merlin: have we defeated evil, as it seems?
Just yes? No mad laughter, no riddles, nothing but a simple yes? That frightens me.
My powers fade, Arthur. I resort to cheap tricks...  Yes! I enjoy every moment of my foolishness, I join in the making of it, so no one can betray me. But you! You betray yourself.
You betray the boy who drew the sword, the boy who saw the Dragon... the Dragon who moves close by, coiling and uncoiling, restless, looking down, waiting for the King to be a king...
I recognize you only as my son, no more.
Your mother told you that?
And I offer only this, Father. To commit with passion and pleasure all the evils that you failed to commit, as man and king.
I don't know. Merlin brought you to me when you were newly born and charged me to raise you as my own. At first, I did so because I feared Merlin, later because I loved you.
--And damsels in besieged castles are waiting to be rescued?
Well, then, I shall tell you which knights have maiden daughters, so you can avoid their castles.
You, my lord.
I am a fighting man and I am married to the quest. That is enough.
I will run.
Is that Mandrake, Lord Merlin?
No. Yes, I am. I am jealous. I want to write poems about you with moonbeams, make the sea sing your name...
Why?
Walls of shining crystals, burning with red fire, furnishings of metals and jewels never seen by man...
You didn't ask!
Merrin? I had notion he was over in Iraq. I think I read he was working on a dig around Nineveh.
You're telling me that, I should take my daughter to a witch doctor? Is that it?
No kidding.
Maybe the circuit is busy?
What didn't he tell you?
I can't believe it.
Storage.
Yes, I'm affraid it is.
Not that I know of.
Want to ask him?
Really? wow.
Uh huh. 'Fraid so.
All right then we've got clean rats.
She is going to be well?
No. It wasn't me. I didn't.
Stimulant? She's higher than a kite right now!
And those lies she's been telling?
Well, specifically, Mrs. MacNeil, she advised me to keep my fingers away from her goddam cunt.
Convulsion?
The temperal lobe is very common. Could last for days, even weeks. It isn't rare to find destructive or even criminal behaviour.
Well of course I'm sure. I'd tell you. Christ, I don't even smoke grass.
Yes am.
Sure did.
He didn't mention her.
The priest.
Yes I did, I'm sorry.
Please.
Well, me and Sharon played a game in the back yard, and we had a picnic down by the river.
Your kidding?
The closet
No you don't. I do it all the time.
Captain Howdy.
You can bring Mr. Dennings if you like.
That's good.
I stole it.
College president shouldn't drink. Tends to set a bad example, I figure I saved them from a big temptation.
Sure.
That's much to vulgar a display of power Karras.
What an excellent day for an exorcism.
In time.
Ego te abslovo.
Who are you?
Uoy era ohw.
Oh really, when?
Why?
Who places her trust in thee, my God.
Amen
Do people tell you look like Paul Newman?
Couldn't it of happened on the fall.
Sick priest, is that it?
Is that a threat?
Very much.
Who's in it?
The Dominicans. Go pick on them.
Are you tired?
Yes?
Yes.
Twelve.
I don't know.
If he talks to me, I think he'll leave you. Do you want him to leave you?
No.
Take it now.
We don't need you, Frankie.
Where are our kids? Has he got one of them in there?
Two at a time?
Oh.
Go fuck yourself.
I thought maybe held gotten over that.
What's the point?
You want me to show up late a few nights?
Lotta water.
Huh?
I hate your kids, Frank.
She threw a goddamn radio into the bathtub. How do you explain that?
Thanks.
No thanks.
No, you gotta go 'cause if you don't get up there every couple weeks you feel guilty. I won't feel guilty, so I don't gotta go.
You'll see.
What do you mean?
Nothing.  Everything's great. Terrific.
Something came up.  Don't worry, Charlie stayed true.  Both nights. I'll give you your share tomorrow. At the house.
Hey pal, I got a mortgage, all right? I got two kids. I got a wife. Besides, he made the deal. There's no shame in it.
I thought maybe twenty percent. Look, with the additional bookings we'll come out ahead.  The big hotels, they want a pretty girl with a big voice. We have to stay competitive, Jack.
It was a somewhat extraordinary day.
I just thought we should talk about it.  Between ourselves.
I told you I was gonna hit you.
You're a fucking alarm clock.
That's what I figure.  Probably have us in a bed-and-breakfast playing to the owls.
First night?
Last?
It was April.  April seventeenth. That one I remember.
Pearls.  White gown.  Beautiful.
Right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Because I can hear it.
What are you talking about?
He was wearing a suit.
How come I didn't hear anything?
Right.  The Royal.  When's the last time we were there?
Just until we find another girl.
No.
A channel. It's just a little further down the dial, that's all. Look, it's publicity.  Publicity's publicity.  Right?
I'm sorry.  I should've checked it out.  I screwed up.  But that doesn't mean you walk out in the middle of a gig.
No, fuck you.  And fuck him too. Fuck the both-of you.
Who's weak now, big brother?
Oh. Fine.  It was nothing.  Couple sore knuckles.  Nothing.
Daughter's.  Sweet sixteen.
She asked for it.
No, no.  You boys are tired.
Doctor's orders.
Blanche.
It's one of Jack's favorites.
We're finished.
Impersonally.
You're an hour and a half late.
What are we, an orchestra all of a sudden?
And how come you guys are the only ones with your pictures on the poster?
Do I look like I'm naked?
Am I missing something?
Hey!
All right, but make it quick.  Shoes!  What size do you wear?
Don't worry.  We'll take it out of your share.
For Christ sake, I said it, I didn't do it.  Besides, I don't think they were too offended, do you?
Hey!
We take the Avedon, right?  Simple.
So find a dime.  Let's get out of here.
For the kids.  Merry Christmas, you two.  Don't forget.  We leave the twenty-sixth.
Baker's unabridged.
Okay.The Fantasy Inn.
I told you, he's got the gift.  Same with music. Hears it once and he's got it.
Great.
They must've bought the same map we did.
Jack woke up on the wrong side of the bottle.
No. You listen.  I had my doubts about you from the beginning
What?
Gotta go.
Job.
So. I'm here, you're here, the piano's here.  What d'ya say?
Baker.
It's been a long time, Ma.
You want me to walk you?
Hey, listen.  You're not going soft on me, are you? I mean, you're not gonna start dreaming about me and waking up all sweaty and looking at me like I'm some kinda princess when I burp.
Guess I got a little scattered.
It means you wouldn't know good if it came up and fucked you.
Coffee?
Look, if you want to leave...
Another five years, huh?
Eddie did.
Sounds big.  What's he do?
Yeah?
Huh? Oh, no.
I'm not much for sweets.
They never should've voted against U.S. statehood -- the scumbags.  We heard you got wasted.
Yeah -- me.
Should be.  It's yours.
Right ... like Jon Archer would ever let that happen.
Shut up.
For what?
Everything I say is wrong. I can't talk to her anymore.
It's important.
Something good?
Must've been after we got engaged.
Were you there to catch me?
One last time.  It's important ...
Can't we call someone? Admiral Lazarro?
Just make sure you're there.  On time.
Mention my family once more and you're dead.
Shoot him!
What makes you so sure this guy's gonna set up his own brother?
What's the matter with your voice, Commander?
Yeah, mom cut me some slack -- but I decided ... I'd like to be here for you.  Here, mom.  You can have it back.  Thanks, though.
Obviously someone else knows it!  Get everybody back to their posts -- NOW!
Are you TRYING to give us away? For somebody with such a big brain, you think awfully small.
D.C.'s very high on giving you the promotion.  There's just one problem.
What is it, Admiral? I'm under the gun here.
No.  Most of them are in transit by now.  I'm heading over to the hotel to personally oversee security.
It didn't work out as planned. Where are you off to?
Okay, I have a confession to make.  But you aren't going to like it.
That's what I'd like to know.  She stole fifty dollars from my purse and took off.
You?  Married?
Stop Jack, I'm getting all weepy.
That'll be a nice little holiday treat.
Hey Santa, where are you? Everybodys here.
Uh...actually, yes. Two... good ones.
Uh huh. The retail end, I understand.
Uh huh...one point seven. And what do you project for this year?
I dont think youre hearing me.
Whats going on here?
But I think I like you better this way...
Youre jumping, sweetheart...
Wheres my real dad?
On a case by case basis...
Check...
Five thirty.  Okay.
Thats where you work.
Ringing my bell...
Is it...?
Kates my wife...
Hey, Im doing the best I can...  Id like to see you hit a squash ball after seventeen beers...
She wants to have an affair with me.
Hey, is that really necessary?
Its your birthday? Today?  Whats your name?  Where were you born?
We bowl together. Were bowlers ...we won a championship...were winners.
Yes...Jack Campbell...
What the hell are you talking about?  Whats he talking about?
Damn, you are the real thing...
Yeah, in most cases that'd be true.
What the hell is happening to me?!
Give me my goddamn life back!
I glimpse?  A glimpse of what!?  What glimpse?! Glimpse!
How much time?!
Look, I just want my life back.  Now whats it gonna take?  You wanna talk turkey?  Lets talk turkey!  How much money...?
Look Jack Im late.  Id love to help you out some more but I gotta go handle my business...  Happy trails.
I dont think so, thank you...
Need a nurse?
Thanks.  To you too...
Look, I dont know whats going on here but I am Senior Vice President of this company.
Maybe youre not hearing me.  I am Jack Campbell...  Right here.  Jack Campbell, President...
What are you talking about?  Its me, Jack Campbell.  Penthouse C. I put you into commercial paper!
About the plane? What do you think its gonna crash? Dont say that...
No, youre right.  What are we doing?
Party?  Oh no, I cant go to a party...
Because youll be here.
Pro bono.  You dont get paid at all.  Nobody makes a dime.  Well, bravo...
Sure.  I really like Annie.
You had a heart attack?
Thats why I work for Big Ed?
Ill fix it.  Ill go out right now and get you something.  Ill make it right.
Are you sure?
I guess...some of them are probably faking.
Its like a museum.
I dont think so. This is going to be a better life for all of us, honey.  Well put Annie and Josh in private schools...
But Ive done some good things too, havent I?
Thats the one...
What do you want from me? You want me to tell you everything that happened was okay?
That'll happen when you're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin...
You suddenly having trouble getting dates?
Do I know you?
But youre not interested in boutique dollars...  I get it...
You are an amazing lover.  You should be giving motivational seminars.
I've got plenty of places to go.
"Sensual blind chick seeks three-ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
Youthful high spirits.
Five times.
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
Well maybe <u>you</u> should date him.
This isn't permanent, Johnny.  We need to be careful until we're normal again.
Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
Give me the god damn mirror!
Go back to the drawing board.
Deb, it's me.  It's still me.
Come on.  Let me buy you something to eat.  Looks like you could use the company.
He <u>also</u> said we'd avoid that storm in space.  And we know how that turned out.
The suit will stretch.  You should try it --
And they're changing into...
What do you mean "complete"?
What he's trying to say is: every team needs a mascot...
Act.  Here we go again.  Reed, what if we got these gifts for a <u>reason</u>?  What if we have some, you know...like, calling?
I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
Stay right.  Left is trouble.
<u>Please</u> tell me you go silent too.
Okay, "mom."
I think that thing is Ben.
Grow up, Johnny.  You want to run around <u>on fire</u> for the rest of your life?
<u>Girl</u>...?!
Dude.  That's my sister.
Sis.  Let <u>me</u> take care of <u>you</u> for once.
Top left, like you asked.  Today Wall Street.  Tomorrow, who knows...maybe Washington.
Not at all.
Hilarious.
So reel him in.  But we came here to do a <u>job</u>.  So let's do it.  <u>Quickly</u>.
It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
Not much.  We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage.
I was talking about us.  Working together.
Passion.
What?  What do you mean you --
Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a <i>massive amount of evidence</i> before making that leap.
Excuse me?
I think it was a little more complicated than --
No.  There weren't.  There was <u>you</u>. And <u>me</u>.  No variables, no math.  It was actually the simplest thing in the world.  But your head got in the way... like it always does.
Why didn't you say something?
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he <u>likes</u> having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic, isn't it?  You're finally the perfect woman for him...because you're his <u>science project</u>.
Here's the overall Target Area...
That blip we're picking up might only be the radio-active particle. The Proteus may already be destroyed...
<Me>?
As part of the Crew.
Oh yes, I've heard of you, Doctor.
Why don't you go on. We'll meet you at the Clearance Desk in a few minutes.
And no matter what happens, you're to take orders <only> from Dr. Michaels, understand?
Yes...slowed down agreat deal.
We'll know -- in the next breath...
No danger of attack, as long as you don't trigger them off by any injury to the System.
Yes, there's no time to spare. And those fibers can be quite tenacious.
No danger of an embolism. At our reduced scale, they're much too minute to prove fatal to Benes.
He certainly is. He should be up and about in no time.
I think it's the most exciting --  We're going to see things no one ever saw before. The actual physical process of Life itself -- not something under a microscope... Just think of it --
Not working for someone like Dr. Duval --
I have no idea.
Not now. We need air, not greetings!
Depends on which end of the telescope you look through.
Look! They follow the direction of her glance, are startled to see:
Captain -- head in the d1rection of the flow and drift with it.
As usual, you want everything your way. Except this time there's more than your damned ego at stake.
Take a close look at your Soul, and your Infinity, and your God out there --
You left something out.
Then why not take it?
We could follow the Optic Nerve to the corner of the Eye.
At an operation?
Walt for the lull -- between the time he inhales and exhales.
Just what it is. Antibodies, destroying Bacteria -- or any other foreign invader that threatens the System.
I'm married.
Positions, please. And strap yourselves in.
Enough to breathe, but that's all.
Dr. Michaels... He went berserk...
Look at those Walls up ahead!
The only danger of turbulence is in the Heart -- and we're not going through it.  Once in the Carotid Artery, we'll remain in the Arterial System... until we reach the point of damage --  -- where Dr. Duval will attempt to dissolve the clot with a laser beam. After the operation, we'll return by way of the Venous System --  -- until we reach the base of the neck --  -- where we'll be removed right here -- with a hypodermic.
I'll guide you, once we're in the Heart.
What?
Whoa, Daddy.
Jezhush.
No, that's not it, Jerry.
You want your own wife kidnapped?
Oh, geez.
...The heck d'ya mean?
Okay, I'm not sayin' I didn't -
One hundred! You lied to me, Mr. Lundegaard. You're a bald-faced liar!
Well, okay - thank you, Detective.
Uh-huh.
I unnerstand.
White Bear Lake?
Pretty darn good, ya want some?
...Yah, okay, I think I'll drive down there, then.
So you were having sex with the little fella, then?
Yah, that can happen.
No, I - they don't want - they're just s'posed to be dealin' with me, they were real clear.
You bet.
Dad! What're they doing? Wuddya think they're doin' with Mom?
No! We can't let anyone know about this thing! We gotta play ball with these guys - you ask Stan Grossman, he'll tell ya the same thing!
My father-in-law, he's the owner.
No. No, ma'am.
Yah, like I told ya, we haven't had any vehicles go missing.
Yah, I see.
We run a pretty tight ship here.
Yeah, but we have an audit here, I just have to know that these vehicles you're financing with this money, that they really exist.
Okay.
Know who this is?
Jerome Lundegaard?
Mr. Lundegaard, that very well may be. I must inform you, however, that absent the receipt of those numbers by tomorrow afternoon, I will have to refer this matter to our legal department.
Yeah, okay. Well, siddown then.  I'm Carl Showalter and this is my associate Gaear Grimsrud.
Sure, Jerry, we're all set. Why wouldn't we be?
Well... I'm goin' ta bed now.
A heck of a lot. What'd you say you were gonna put there?
I thought you were gonna show it to Stan Grossman. He passes on this stuff before it gets kicked up to me.
Yah.
Yah, but I - okay, I would, I'd guarantee ya your money back.
No! They said no cops! They were darned clear on that, Wade! They said you call the cops and we -
Yah, but think this thing through here, Wade. Ya give 'em what they want, why wont' they let her go? You gotta listen to me on this one, Wade.
No, Wade! They were real clear! They said they'd call tomorrow, with instructions, and it's gonna be delivered by me alone!
Margie. Thought you might need a little warm-up.
Yah.
Uh - I just, I think I'm gonna barf.
I'm fine - it's just morning sickness.
Yah?
Yah? Well, what now, d'ya think?
Uh-huh.
Yah.
Gotta go?
Aw, you can sleep, hon.
Well, how the heck are ya?
Yah, ya know it's the Radisson, so it's pretty good.
It's okay, Mike...
Anyone else residing there?
Nope.
Yah, is this Marge?
His wife?
Yah, he - he's been struggling. He's living with his parents now.
Lundegaard's father-in-law's accountant.
- looking.
Still missing. We're looking.
Copy. Yah, send me back-up!
Yah, Menominie only has Chief Perpich and he takes February off to go to Boundary Waters.
Love ya, Margie.
Uh-huh.
Oh, pretty good. They bitin'?
Yah.
She's visiting relatives in Florida. Now his boss, this guy Gustafson, he's also disappeared. Nobody at his office knows where he is.
Where's Tyler?
Right, right.
...using steroids.  I was a juicer. Diabonol, then, Wisterol -- it's for racehorses, for Christsake.  Now I'm bankrupt, divorced, my two grown kids won't return my calls...
It must've been Tuesday.  he was wearing his "cornflower-blue" tie.
I'll expose you.
Okay.  I'll take blood parasites and organic brain dementia --
Then, take blood parasites.  It's yours.  Now we each have three.
The girl had done her homework.
Let's not make a big thing out of it.
This isn't a for-real suicide thing. This is probably one of those cry-for- help things.
I got this dress at a thrift store for one dollar.
Goodbye.
Good.
Well... thanks, anyway.
Chloe's dead.
Do you care?
Let go of me...  Leave me alone.
Marla, it's me.  Have we... have we ever had sex?
The were burning their fingertips with lye.  The stink was unbelievable.
Absolutely, you have every right.  I need you to do me a favor.
Then, I'll have the clam chowder... fried chicken and a baked potato with everything and a chocolate chiffon pie.
I deserve that.  Anyway, I've... I've only just realized
Okay, if that's what it takes, you'll never have to see me again.  Here... here...
Yes.
Yes... it's a test.
What?
Please return your seatbacks to their full upright and locked position.
Excuse me?  "Throwers?"
My suitcase was vibrating?
Yeah, uh huh... yeah?  Oh...
I wasn't really dying, I wasn't host to cancer or parasites; I was the warm little center that the life of this world crowded around.
Now, find your power animal.
... i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...
Look what we've accomplised.  Thirty seconds.
Tyler Durden.
What do you want me to do?
Being clever.
...no ...no ...
This time maybe get a widescreen TV. You'll be occupied for weeks.
A hotel?
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
It affords him other interesting opportunities.
Like hell.  That counted.
Strange.
Is it?
What fight?
My dad.  No question.
Soldier of Fortune.  Business Week. New Republic.
Doesn't matter.
I'm fine.
Marla doesn't need a lover.  She needs a case worker.
Uh... nah...
I was going to my cave to find my power animal.
No, what you're feeling is premature enlightenment.
No, I'm not...
Work.  Going to work.
I heard.  Local 15, Monday nights.
Homework assignment.
Hey.
Look...
I want to know --
Fuck my life.  Fuck fight club.  Fuck you and fuck Marla.  I'm sick of this.  How's that?
Nothing.
Why do people think I'm you?
You can see me and hear me, but no one else can...
The house is rented in your name.
Night jobs -- while you were sleeping.
Since when is Project Mayhem about murder?
I'm serious.  That's the wrong one.
I quit.
Yes.
I think this is about where we came in.
It's out of our hands.  This is it.
Fifteen seconds now.  Can you see alright?  10... 9... 8....
Not exactly according to plan.
Proceed with remote detonation.
Why are you doing this?!
Don't worry about us, sir.  We're solid.
You told me you'd say that, too.
What he wanted?  Look... look at him. Look at him!  What does he want?  This is a person.  This is not a cog in your machine...
No, no.  This is a man -- this man has a name...
No!  Wrong!  This man's name is Robert Paulson.
Robert Paulson is dead.  He's dead, because of you...
No!
We need some towels, Lou.  We need replacement light bulbs.
Yesssss...
Yeah ... animals and s-s-s ---
I had a premonition about the Route 18 pile up... I saved some people. And now I think Death is after me.
Signs?
The songs on the radio.  But wait.  I don't understand.  Why is this even happening to me?
I have to save Eugene!
We need to hurry.
Don't sweat it.  It's over.
Your entire world view just went out the window.  I couldn't expect a religious conversation overnight. We'll get through this.  I promise.
Blow me.
Evan Shaeffer's dead.  Guess he wasn't as lucky as we thought.
No.  What's this about?
What was the fight about?
Does she have a cell phone?  A way we can contact her?
Just shut the fuck up and maybe you'll live.
Yeah, so what happened?
Hold on.
Who is this guy, anyway?
It sounds all well and good, but what if we're wrong?
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
He can't breathe damn it.  I think his lung's collapsed!
I don't...what if I made a mistake?
Highway to Hell, Highway to Hell.
I...I don't know.
Hey, Dad.  What's up?
I will, Dad.  Bye, luv you.
I love you too, Dad.  Goodnight.
Jeez, Mom, stop trippin'.
Yeah, but everything's always in transition. If you focus, even now, one week into summer... you can feel Autumn coming.  Almost like bein' able... to see the future.
Right. April 25th.
Get out! Get out of the car!
No! No! Don't!
I wish you were on the plane!
Look, there's something you should all know.
You get off havin' control over me. Let me choose how to deal with it.
C'mon, man, like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over Greenland, or something?
Oh, you've noticed it, too?
No harm. No foul.
Me, right? That's why you're not saying.
May as well go out under my own free will, right?
Huh?
Yeah.  It's not hard once you get the hang of it.  In the wrist. Anyway, I did what I always do when I get one...
Put it in the guard's barracks.  Man they got pissed.  They beat the crap out of me, but... it's kind of a tradition.  You oughta see 'em run around.
Where's your stuff?
Who cares?  Let's just do it and get out.  Go have a Jacuzzi and get laid in Bangkok.  Know what I mean?
You comin'?
How much we got left in that minigun?
Sure.  I only sound like forty-year- old in your language.
Carefully.  Don't want to get shot by you.  Bad karma.  Anyway, you need me.
How you going to get there?  You can't trust the spooks to pull you out.  They'll use you up and throw you away.
How?
Minigun.  Come on.  Let's move. He's coming in on our open side.
Let's get that tent down!
Sorry, Sir.  Can't do it.
We like you.  At least the computer at Langley likes you.  Pulled your file because of various factors.  Service record. Area familiarity.
We don't try to pull out any of our guys if we find them?
We just take pictures?
I was crossed-trained in gunships.
That's right.
Sir, there's something else... a TRANSAT relay.  Just came through.
Couple hours.  Let me buy you a coffee.
POWs?  I don't know.  But either way it'll get that subcommittee off our necks.  Cream?
Look, Colonel... we're all adults here.  This is a war.  A very quiet, very intense war.  People get sacrificed.
That's a crock.  We don't say that. Do you have any idea the shitstorm if he'd gotten back with that guy? If it went public?  The White House would have to act through channels. We're talking ransom.  Four billion bucks in war reparations to Vietnam to get the others back.  That's billion, Colonel.  With a "B".  For a few guys that've had their brains in a blender for ten years?  A pain in the ass to everybody?  No way. There's no way.
De Fravio.  Dave De Fravio. Lieutenant... Air Force.
Colonel.
Those men are all dead.
Keep it clean, Rambo, or I'll nail your hide to the shed.
That all depends on you. ...Sure you don't want a drink?
Do I look like I have someone special?
Really?
Hey? What did I tell you? Why don't you come? It's just dinner. You'll have something to tell your mother next time she calls.
I'm shocked.  With a child bearing body like yours...  ... why a man would have to be out of his mind!
Anne, they're MY moods. If you want to understand moods, have one of your own!
Two kids tried to set me on fire.
You still believe in God?
Oh, I got a pimple... This stuff is supposed to blend with my skin color... Like it really works, ya know...
I don't know her last name... I'll be off in a second.
The moron?
And this is our other..uh...co-worker.. Parry..uh...Parry....
Thank you very much.
Well..everything's closed up. We thought we'd get some dinner.  Say!....Anybody up for Chinese?  Have you eaten? Would you like to come along?
No.  So what time do you need?  I love you -- you love me -- you want to get your career going, great!  I'd like to be a part of it -- I think I deserve that!  So what do you need to figure out alone!?
I didn't know.  I just said all I want is some time.
Huh-huh....You son of a bitch!
I'm afraid not ... Then again, I'm not sure. The beating's bad but it's not the problem... It seems he's.. re-experiencing the catatonia... So, like before, he could snap out it in an hour or in thirteen months or thirteen years... ....I don't know. There's no way to tell.
I think she likes me... she gave me her number, but she must work a lot cause when I call she's never home... But I think we'll go out this weekend... I've...
No...  He is supposed to live there?
Jack, it's a sitcom -- you're not defining Pi.
I was nine in the sixties.
Well, congratulations Lydia, because out of several thousand card holders... in conjunction with several major credit card companies...
Yes. Hi..Congratulations. Jack Lucas. Nice to meet you finally. This is Anne Napolitano, the owner of Video Spot.
Yes.  They're free.
No... no... that's all right... I thought I knew her... Thanks...
They're --  -- What?
I'm the one what?
Oh, please... you're embarrassing me.
Huh-huh. I'm deeply smitten.
Well, if every time someone did something offensive they hit in the head with a pebble, I think they might alter their behavior. What do you think Jack...
Fifty dollars?
No..no, it's..I don't know what to say. This is so nice of you...Jack...
You're totally gone, aren't you?
Buddy, the days of the debutantes are ... not what they used to be.
Have you ever done any cloudbusting? You lie on your back and you concentrate on the clouds...and you try yo break them apart with your mind. It's wild.
What?
<u>Parry</u>!  Close your pants...
OWW...MAN...
You won't be alone for long.
I mean you don't have to say nice things to me... That kind of thing is a little old fashioned for what we're about to do.
And then we'll exchange phone numbers and you'll leave and never call and I'll go to work and feel great for the first hour and then slowly turn into a piece of dirt by lunch.  Why am I putting myself through this?  It was very nice... uh meeting you. Good night..
A wig?
Well, lemme play the other side then.
You said.
You can sing the song.
That's right, hand.
I'm not.
Yes.
You're the pathetic one, not me.
You go slippin' around in front a my face, an' in front a Elton an' Stoney. What do you imagine they think a someone you treat that way...
You'll be gone, period.
I love it.
I'll tell you...  ... l-a-t-e-r.
Oh, you're not going to kill yourself this time. I wish I'd known...
I don't know.
No.
Fill it up.
Palm Apodaca.
Alaska? Are you on vacation?
But I can't have any. Is that what you mean?
Now all you have to do is hold the chicken, bring me the toast, charge me for the sandwich, and you haven't broken any rules.
You know who it once belonged to?
Yeah, me, too...
I don't think you should infer Daddy was wrong in front of him...
No, no, I don't think that, I'm just curious about it...  Do you think I'm a freak?
Yeah. I said a week, and I've overstayed myself...
What have I been doing? Different things, different jobs, here and there. Nothing that interesting.
Yeah, I'll probably be free.
I think it's what you think.
I don't think that's accurate...
I'm not faking anything. I'm looking for some bath oil...
It's direct, anyway, which seems to be difficult for you.
That's right.
Is he?
What?
Catherine...
Just give me a chance, will you?
I hope it will, yes.  I'm sorry.
What?
Is she?
Well, I was goin' to, but Bobby said he hadda kind of feel things up here first, which I can understand, but then it went an' took so long, I ran flat outa money...  I didn't have no number to call, you know.  So I hadda clear outa there an' come on up here, in the hopes that I wouldn't be intrudin' myself...
Away from the piano, Tita, you have no sense of time at all.
Jesus, what a rude person...
A dispose-all, what's that but more crap? I've never seen such crap. Oofh, I don't know how people get up in the morning.
Not dirt. See, dirt isn't bad. It's filth. Filth is bad. That's what starts maggots and riots...
Steam.
There's some good things on it, though.
The TV. There's some good things on it, sometimes.
Well, you have to simply tell me, that's all.
Now she's tellin' me what the fuck to do.
Hi.
Of course.
You got a boyfriend?
Nah, we make out and stuff.
I can't!
Yo, Carlos-I'm gonna punch you.
I got punished, man.
I can't man, I'm punished!
Eddie from Compost?
No, c'mon, stop playin'. The girl that you kissed when we got there. Where s he live at?
Umm, he got dark brownish eyes, he got a nice nose I love his nose. I love his skin. I love his lips, he got a great smile and he got-
You gonna talk to him?
Your friend must be misinformed.
Not really.
Jus' from around the way.
Unbelievable.
Sally Ann Cavanaugh. Oh wait, she couldn't work in your office, she's not from around here.
Whaddyamean 'maybe'?
Full name.
I'm about to break that beach wide open, and I don't need some pennyante Woodward and Bernstein getting in the way of my men.
Put the gun down, Alan. I'll take care of them.
Joan or Margaret Smith.
Well, which one?
Funny old bird.
He was in intensive care for eight weeks.
No, not for sure. When it comes, it comes. You gonna want some shit?
You don't know me.
You don't have a piece of the action?
What?
Well, I didn't want to say anything, but I thought the dead man was my brother.
Thank you.
My lawyer was a bum.
I'd have been long gone.
Harry S. Truman?
Isn't that nice. Good man. Showed the Japs a thing or two.
Come on in.
Oh, about ten days ago.
Mrs. Stanwyk, may I borrow this picture. I promise to send it back to you. It's routine, really. The actuarial people need to --
You sure did.
Right.
Maybe, Fletch. Is that Brazil?
Why not?
Are you on a scavenger hunt of some kind?
Will this proposition entail my dressing up as Tina Turner?
Who?
I want it done Thursday evening, around eight PM. My wife will be off to the club for a committee meeting. It's the staff's night off.  These will be open.
I will be here in the room, waiting for you. The safe will be open and there will be fifty thousand dollars in it. You will be wearing rubber gloves. Do you own rubber gloves?
Very good. My .357. Use it and no one can trace it to you. The room will be in some disarray.
Precisely. Are you a good shot?
Sure, all drifters do.
You sure those doors will be open?
You sure got the hard part.
I'm sorry?
No, thank you.
I can't figure out why I went to Utah for the morning.
No, I think you should stay the same wonderful person you are today.
Here, take mine.
Yes.
Utah is not exactly a cure for boredom.
Oh, listen to me. I've never even been there and look what I say about it. Anyway, I know there'd be nothing for me to do. I don't even know anybody there.
He never sees them and I never met them.
So, your husband hired me to kill him. That's the truth.
How do you know about that?
What does all this mean?
Swarthout. Yes. He's the man who sold us the ranch in --
But I've seen the deed.
Trust you? I may seem a little goofy at times, but I'm not a complete Bozo, you know.
Act natural.
I think you better sit down.
I'm telling you he's not your husband at all.
I'm calling the police. Right now.
You shouldn't be here.
They'll be back. He had to go in for a urinalysis.
In her cabana, sir.
Charged to the Underhills, sir?
Yes, sir. Beluga. But it is eighty dollars the portion.
Sierra del fuego.
What?
Lock's busted.
I work for the landlord. He told me to watch out for the place.
What?
Moved out.
She moved out.
Frank, you look a little peaked. Wanna vomit?
And a damn fine one, I might add.
Irwin...
...never reads the paper...
Why not? Oh shit... really?
You broke it? You know the source?
Cool your tool, Frank, I need a little more time. I think I'm really on to something here.
I really don't want to spoil your surprise, Frank. Why don't you read it tomorrow?
What about finding the source?
Who? Donnie and Marie?
Mrs. Stanwyk, I hate to disturb you. Tom Underhill here... I'm a new member.
Who's your decorator?
I need you to find my little sister. She goes by the name Zuzu...
Excuse me?
Yeah, but of course for now, I only get a twenty.
Nonsense.  After what you've been through, it sounds like I owe you.
Damn, Ford, you're the most cynical man in the industry and that's not easy.
Tell me about it. Name's Kyle Troy.  Can't we bring up the bass.
I love you, too, baby.  He wants to meet at six.  What time is it now?
Ah -- ha... You know, you should think about dating Earthmen again.
I found a lot of Art Mooneys. None with a police record, though. Not even Synchronicity.  Have you checked out Johnny Pinzolo/Crunch's houseboat yet?
Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
Let's get her out of here, before she starts a shoot-out.  Drop us at my place.
Johnny's C.D.?
C.D.s.  The music kind.  From the Grendel label.
Oh.  Three hundred coming right up.
Fluck you!
It's Spunk Lewis, the lead singer for Dead Ribbit!  Mr. Bus Driver, stop!
Friends?  You didn't tell me that.
Zuzu, be quiet.  Put in Colleen's disc.  Number two.
No, wait...
There's that question...
Well what is it?  I'm not Kreskin.
Jesus, how could you be so stupid?  Come on, we're going to a hospital.
Yeah, uh, I got some pretty good leads...
Good news is that yeah, I found him.  The bad news is...
Shut the heck up... Pop.
Why do you hate me?  It's gotta be more than Me Private You, You Cop.
Yeah, and that lead singer, Jesus, that white Van McCoy wanna-be with the six-inch platform shoes. He looked...
Really?
I guess you never saw 'A Very Brady Christmas.'
I'm off it!
You gotta be kidding!  This is unfuckingbelievable!  I have to start the evening crawling down Capital Records, I shoulda chose suicide then, but oh no, the night was young!  Next up, my guitar! The second most important thing I own and now it's toothpicks for the homeless on Hollywood Boulevard!  Then, then, after I burned up your brother, Jazz... I should say as a fucking footnote I've usually treated women like shit -- used corsages, the wet spot, you know giving out Domino's Pizza's phone number and saying it's mine... Tonight was different. I felt respect.  I felt love.  Then Jazz left me... and <u>now</u> I get to die!
Boing.  You're one hell of a lip reader.
Shock.
Oh God, please, <u>don't</u>!
It's 7:30.  You really should get a watch.
Ciao.
What is this, are you holding a microphone behind my head?
I'll tell you when somebody pays me to give a shit and stuff.
Hebedeebuh.  Hebedeebuh.  Maybe I did die in the explosion.
Fucking amazing, huh?  Chevy Nova, you Bensonhurst shit!  Still in La-la land.  Look at us, two rock 'n' roll dicks.  Unfortunately, only one of us is a detective.
Mr. Doyle.
Everything is everything.
There's nothing around.  Nobody's holding.
Doesn't register.
Did you ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
You made three sales to your roaches back there.  We had to chase you through all this shit and you tell me you're clean?
Who's this --
Je peux l'ouvrir tout de suite?
Pour moi?
Je n'ai jamais vu tant de sérenité. Elle m'a demandé de tes nouvelles et si nous étions heureux.
What happens to the schedule?
S'right.
He got off on six.
Perhaps he's visiting a guest.
Yeah, I know.
I hear the health department is going to close this joint for selling dirty beer.  I come by to help you carry out your money.
Hey, Mutch!  You want bacon?
The Westbury?  Balls.  I got him down at the subway at Times Square. What the hell's goin' on?  I make him coming right out of the hotel free as a bird.  Not a soul awake.
Some other time Jimmy, I'm beat.
What for -- you wanna play Hide the Salami with his old lady?
This could be it, Walter.  This Candy Store guy, putting on a big show in a fancy nightclub with known connections all over him. Then on our own, after working the whole day and night, we tail him out to Brooklyn and sit on him for a week practically, and who do we come up with?  Joel Weinstock.  You gotta let us have it.
Pour it in your ear.
This is my case.  Get these guys off my back and let me handle it.
Third time around.
Forty dollars -- was $250.
Darling, may I have this one?
Why is it called Hellgate?
For garbage?
Joel, don't jerk me.  I spent a lot o' time settin' this one up.
You go to Xavier High School, Daryl?
What I know is what I told you.
Wish I was.  Oldest part of the system down there.  We're on it, but it's gonna take awhile.
We tried.  Bulkhead door's rusted shut. Won't budge.
There's a manhole at Canal and Bowery.
He ain't the only one.
I'm sorry, Frank, but you need to come outside.
I think you know, Frank.
Uh, huh.
Satch, you gotta listen to me...
Queens, New York.
I don't really follow baseball anymore.
Right...and I'm asking how you called the game.
What the hell does Gordy have to do with it?
I'm dreaming this.  Shit, this is a dream.
Nothing...I just spilled something.
What?
Sun spot?
Wait a sec...there was something on the news.  Something about this space anomaly.  I think they said it was connected to some storm in '69.
Fire.
It was an abandoned warehouse - hit by lightening.  Butch told Ma it was just one wrong turn. Said it wasn't your fault.  You went with the training, with your instincts.  If you'd just gone left instead of right, you would've made it.
Tomorrow.  Jesus...it hasn't happened. It doesn't have to happen.
Chief?!  Is that you?
It's Mom.
She's not here.
He didn't just kill three women anymore. He killed ten.
Something we did changed the case...changed history.  Mom wasn't dead.  But then after you didn't die in the fire something must have happened.  And this guy, this Nightingale guy, he kept on killing...it was like a spree...seven more women.
What if the radio stops working?  Christ, what if I can't reach you again?
Tell 'em there's a homicide in progress... cause by the time they show up there will be.
Yeah, I think so...
What?
Right, now I need you to tape it up on the outside, where he touched it, so the prints keep.
Call the FBI.  Use a pay phone.  Don't give 'em your name, Dad.  Just tell 'em that it was Shepard who killed Finelli and Clark and the others.  That he's the Nightingale.
What the hell is that smell?
Longbranch...?
Fire?  What are you talking about?  He had cancer, John.
She made up her mind.  Nothin' I do is gonna change it.
April 16...?  That means she was the first.
Uh, huh.
Just cause he didn't want to look at the photos doesn't mean he isn't the doer. Not everyone fits the profile.
So how are things at the hospital?
Yeah, that's right.
No.  No.  Well, sort of.  In my heart. Been dead 29 years.
A hot shot, huh?
Where are you going?
I mean, is there any place in particular where we can drop you off?
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
Why?
I'm sorry.  I just wanted to surprise you.  What can I say?
Hello.  How are you?
Okay.  There's a whole weekend ahead of us.  There's time.
Did you stay here last night?
Why don't we drive over to the cove and watch the sunset.  It'll mellow you out.
It's deceiving.
... To prove something to myself... to prove I'm stronger than I think I am.
You promised you'd never ask me.
Sort of.
Come on, Shelly.  Who else is gonna give him a lift?
Keep looking.
Look at it this way... things can only get better... Right?
It was nothing.
Don't say any more.
Alright, alright.
Stay cool?  You ain't Dirty Harry. Now stop it.
I wish it was.
It's a damn company executive game, and she's a damn company exec.
Megan, my deputies have more important things to do than look for camp counselors with car trouble.
When you stop acting like one... Tommy Jarvis is a very sick boy. And you...
All he's asking is for you to check it out.
Tommy, my father is out looking for you right now.  Something happened tonight and he's sure you're responsible.  If he finds you, he'll...
Hide it behind the gas station. Then we can get the hell out of here.
No.
Come and get it.
Nancy.
Huh?
But what I get scared again?
Are you ready?  He's taken our young men off to teach them my favorites sport.
I don't know.  He called somebody, then took off.
Will you listen, dammit!
Yeah.  Jason murdered them and...
Yes, but they released me because...
Either you go to sleep or I'll come in there and put you out.
Jason's not in his coffin!  Hawes is!  Dig it up!  You gotta dig it up!!
Eight times.  They've burned him, dipped him in nuclear waste --
-- look, just shut up.  Let's cut through the shit.  You asked me here because you want me to catch and kill Jason Voorhees for ya'.  I'll do it, but it won't be easy...and it won't be cheap.  One hundred grand, non- negotiable.
Skin stretcher was human.
I know everything about you, Diana.
It's going.
Not so bad, today.
Do you have to ask?
Sorry, Di.  I was just going to my car.  I didn't mean to frighten you...
I was going to, I was going to tell everyone.  I just...didn't expect to be back here so soon.  Is Steven around?
Yeah.  Sit down a second.  There's something I need to tell you about Steven...
Oh my God, Steven.
Have a good night.
Until I hear the truth.
Never.
Really?
My parents are open minded about that sort of thing.
You're talking to the prom queen, Eva. Do you really think I'm going to risk getting caught?
I mean, Lakeview High just closed its doors for good, right?
Hear what?
The fire alarm...
Don't be ridiculous!
Perfectly.
No, I think it's just the beginning.
He is not.
You can and you will! Swim, Rennie!
That's wonderful, Miss Van Deusen...what's it about?
Whenever I get near the water, I see this young boy drowning. He tries to pull me down with him.
No. It was just a normal summer. I've never been able to figure it out.
The LORAN has a digital printout of your latitude and longitude. Give me the coordinates and we'll be there as quick as we can.
Hi, Sean.
We changed our minds.
What do you mean???
Is the ship going to sink??
It's over, finished and done with.
Don't needle me, Elliot. Tell me how bad you feel. We're suppose to feel bad together. This is what friends do.
Tonight you find out what it means to suffer.
Before his Broadway days. He reviewed the one-act I did at the Fulton Fish Market. We did this play at four AM, outdoors in the rain. One performance. For the fish handlers.
Steven Schwimmer. I memorized every word of this review.
What was it like?
Where is it?
What are you talking about?
Does what feel comfortable?
I talked to her two days ago.
About what?
The Red Sox blow a chance to win their first World Series since 1918. You expect me to miss that for an opening night?
It's all worked out. They'll lose tonight. Then they'll lose tomorrow. I see it with stunning clarity.
Why do you need a radio?
And he hears it the same time I hear it? What happened to family secrets?
Because they get outstanding settlements. And Mother is determined that this time there's no turning back.
Thanks, Daddy. But I just need one. Mother's not going.
I know -- why should a bitter divorce interfere with tradition?
Daddy, wait.
First you tell me.
We're strangers in the night. The last thing we want is honesty.
Two-all after six.
All right. What's been going on?
I'm glad we're having this talk.
Since when did that matter?
Might be an accident on the West Side Highway.
It's a simple subject.
Life is good.
It's a test all right. They're bringing in Stanley.
Why do you care?
When I traveled through Asia this summer, I went to tremendous trouble and expense to rent a car with a phone so I could call up Sports Phone in New York and get the scores. I drove through the war in Afghanistan calling Sports Phone like every hour on the hour, for updates.
You're out of bullets.
Well I am. Worried sick. Everybody quotes Steven Schwimmer. He's here to announce the death of civilization. He kills a play every time he farts.
You're not making sense.
I have excellent long-term memory.
We have a very nice pasta today. Alla Putanesca.
I was in the fish-market play. What happened to him?
Not one of Steven's finer moments.
A little drastic maybe?
Is what true?
There's a certain kind of wounded young man who uses his oddness to get laid. Is that our Steven?
Yes.
I'm going home to my machine.
Stop!
I'm simply going to prove to Muslims there, and Hindus here, that the only devils in the world are those running around in our own hearts -- and that's where all our battles ought to be fought.
Well, we shall try.
Let me hang on with two hands or I will fall.
Going nearer to God!
I think you do.  But I thank God we all don't.
Ah, but my puritanism runs the another way. I'm far too modest for such a display.
He's waiting. He's not prepared to accept it will mean as much as you think.
That the fighting will stop -- that you make me believe it will never start again.
Hm. And what should an "important professional" write about your response to General Smuts's new legislation?
You will respect the law.
Even as a boy I thought so.
Hm.  Is it?
No... no. In every temple and mosque they have pledged to die before they lift a hand against each other.
I'll send my gardener. I'm sure you'll have much to discuss.
I mean a day of prayer and fasting. But of course no work could be done -- no buses, no trains, no factories, no administration. The country would stop.
I'm hardly that, Mr. Patel.
Not true!  The secret is mastering the urge.
There is nothing I can give.
...an eye for an eye making the whole world blind.
Come with me now, Vincent.  You've gone as far as you can go.
I will prove it to you.  Come swim with me now, Vincent.  Now--tonight.
I guess I'm a slow learner.
I'll see what I can do.
By the way, I left some trash in your locker.
A man's dead, Detective.
--What <i>about</i> his profile?
This <i>is</i> the most likely location--
Is there something more we should know about this suspect, Sir?  I mean besides what's on his sheet.
We're already getting complaints about frivolous search.
None of the ID photos match the enhancement.
Get it.  From outside, if you have to.
So we have two choices.  Either our suspect came back to the murder scene for a drink of water and I don't know anybody that thirsty or...  ...he <i>is</i> here.  We test again.  You're right, Hugo, this was a desperate act.  Someone had a lot to lose that night--perhaps their place in line.  I'd like the profiles of everyone with an upcoming mission.
This time I will supervise each test personally.
If anybody asks, tell them the truth-- your family disowns you.  You are a disappointment, Jerome.
Wrong color.  It's silver.  It's not easy living up to this.
And drinking it.  It's like Evian by the time it's filtered.
--What car?--Go to sleep.
Any particular reason?
I'm not going anywhere.  Less than a week to go. Not on your life--
How could they recognize you?  <i>I</i> don't recognize you.  Anyway, you don't have a choice.  You run, you may as well sign a confession, turn us both in right now.  No, we stick this out-- find out what we can but change nothing.  This is a minor inconvenience is all it is.  We've taken worse heat than this.  Jesus, if I'd known you were going to go belly up on me at the last fucking gasp, I wouldn't have bothered.  You can't quit on me now.  I've put too much into this.  Besides, this stuff is <i>mine</i>.  I had other offers, you know.  I could have rented myself out to somebody with a spine.  You want me to wheel in there and finish the job myself?  We'll take off all right, from pad 18 just like we planned.
Good choice.
Not bad, Jerome.
I could always walk.  I've been faking it.
We would like Vincent to have a brother... you know, to play with.
That's the hair color in his profile?
You worried about the cost?
They said the same thing about myopia and obesity.  You think your children would be less human if they were less violent, angry, spiteful?  Maybe they'd be <i>more</i> human.  From where I sit the world could stand a little improving.
I've found him too.
No.
Why would we do that?
Friend?
Just some In-Valid.  Vincent--  --somebody.
I guess somebody beat me to it.
You've never been here?  Let me order for you.
Let's walk.
Not so long--just once around the sun.
There's a problem, Lamar.
I can't do this.
Not like <i>this</i> one.
Antonio--
Hard to judge how these things happen. The Parole Board almost never reverses their decisions.
They may nail me into this now, McCoy.
You still don't get the picture do you? I've always heard what a smart ass operator you are.
I bet.
My license expired, let's get out of here.
Yeah.
I want to take a walk.
What do you mean? You've never been there.
Small town, small bank, big money.
I made a mistake. I'll never make another one.
Just the way I remembered.
Fatter... some things never change.
I'm still here, Doc.
Sure.
I laugh when I feel happy. Sometimes just thinking of you made me laugh. I had a lot of that. And other times that wasn't enough. I had a lot of that too. I know you find it hard to believe, I'm happy just loving you.
But sometimes I cried a lot too.
If we are clean Gollie will take us over at Nogales. If we are hot we'll have to try Laughlin at El Paso.
Bullshit.
He might be ready to chop us up.
I wouldn't worry Doc. I can always get you out... I'll screw every prison official in Texas if I have to.
I can handle it.
Why, there's nothing on the news?
I'll tell you something, Doc. One day you're going to have to trust somebody...
El Paso.
I think so... I don't know.
It's all a game, don't bother me.
You and me.
I'll be ready.
Get in the shower. You'll feel okay.
Laughlin. He's always got his family around... that wife and kid of his have to stand by his side to make sure he stays off the juice and horses.
Hell, I don't know... but we sure gave it a run.
Yeah, why not? We're the good guys.
Me, neither. There's about twelve people in the state that aren't Mormons and I'm one of them.
Two boxes of double-ought buck.
Whatever you need.
Aren't we going a little hard?
Growing -- all of them - every day.  318, you'll be the only ones on the floor.
Suit yourself.
I kinda doubt it.
After you come back I'll listen while you make some phone calls, tell a few friends you've got to leave for a week or two... You have to call another Vet about the animals. You tell him to come over and take good care of them starting tomorrow... no slip-ups on that. They got to be looked after...
Yes, you do, Albert. Talk or I'll kill you.
I know.
'Good.'
Yes, but listen. Christ, I didn't kill him.
What happened to this car?
Yeah.
He was drunk. Drunk as a lord.
What name?
Jack...
Doreen.
He was all right to me.
It's the truth.
What?
Really?
Really?
While he was here. You went about together?
Yeah, I'll do you a favour.
So where are we going, Princess?
Of course. Where else?
We're there now.
Brumby.
He won't. He thinks I'm simple.
Now you're asking.
You've been watching the film.
I don't know.
Shouldn't think so.
Expect so.
The girl's name was Doreen. That's all I know.
Frank was a good bloke. It's the least I could have done.
Working at Woolworths.
Yes.
Large Scotch.
Old Thorpey? Haven't seen him in a long time.
Yeah.
I'm sorry. Here. This'll pay for a course in karate.
My brother, Frank.
Don't ask me.
What's that supposed to mean?
Yes, thank you.
I'm going to sit in the car and whistle 'Rule, Britannia'.
How could I stay away?
It would be. If they were still living.
That's all right, Eric.
Oh, Cyril, eh? So it's all girls together, is it?
Piss off, Ray.
Yeah, I'll do that.  Told you it wouldn't take long, didn't I?
We've got to take you back to London.
But they have to be diplomatic.
The gun he means.
Ha.
That's right.
...Polacks...
...they hold on to their money...
I...I don't know.
What?
They came in and they, you know...
And now...
...cower in his boots...
...sales promotion, "You lose, then we fire your..." No.  It's medieval... it's wrong. "Or we're going to fire your ass." It's wrong.
I heard that they were running cold.
Yes.
Himself?
What?
That's the truth...
Well.  Well...
Not actually, no.
What will he pay?
For five thousand?
Is that what I said?
He would take you on.  Yes.
You're, you're saying so you have to go in there tonight and...
Yes.
Why would they come to me?
Yes.  I'm sure.
...they take me, then.  They're going to ask me who were my accomplices.
That's none of your fucking business...
Yes.
Uh-huh.
What do you care...?
He filed half of them, he filed the big one.  All the little ones, I have, I have to go back and...ah, fuck, I got to go out like a fucking schmuck hat in my hand and reclose the...  I mean, talk about a bad streak. That would sap anyone's self confi... I got to go out and reclose all my... Where's the phones?
They stole the...
They stole the phones.  They stole the leads.  They're...Christ.  What am I going to do this month? Oh, shit...
...what am I going to do all month...
Was I?
No.
You understand?
No.
I'll be at the restaurant. </pre> </html>
Rick, I'm going to flag a cab.
Just go to lunch.
Excuse me...
Did they find the guy who broke into the office yet?
Please don't leave.  I'm going to talk to you.  What's your name?
Levene!
I'm talking with Mr. Lingk.  If you please, I'll be back in.  I'll be back in a while...I told you, check with Mr. Williamson.
Could I...
You're done, come down, and let's...
...you want to see the court records?  John?  Eh?  You want to go down...
...do you want to go downtown...?
Roma.
Moss.
...after the thirtieth...
You're saying that I'm fucked.
You start closing again, you'll be on the board.
Not lately you can't...
I'm asking you.  As a favor to me?  John.  John: my daughter...
I have to go...
I can't split them.
Somebody broke in.
What does that fucking mean?
What Roma's trying to tell you. What I told you yesterday.  Why you don't belong in this business.
Sure!  I robbed the office.  Sure.
Was it?
Where have you been, Shelly?  Bruce and Harriet Nyborg.  Do you want to see the memos...?  They're nuts... they used to call in every week. When I was with Webb.  And we were selling Arizona...they're nuts...did you see how they were living?  How can you delude yours...
Call up the bank.  I called them.
They took the phones...
Last night, this morning.
"You have to believe in yourself... you"--look--"alright...?"
"I want to tell you something, Harriet..."
From the store.
Like you taught me...
No, Mr. Roma.  I don't need the time, I've made a lot of investments in the last...
Yes.
Beautiful.  Beautiful rolling land. I was telling Jim and Jinny, Ray, I want to tell you something.  You, Ray, you eat in a lot of restaurants.  I know you do...
Uh...
Well, it isn't coming out until the February iss...sure.  Sure, go ahead, Ricky.
Didn't I say I was taking the two o'...
One moment, I'll be right with you.  In fact, a...one point, which I spoke to you of which  I can't talk to you about here.
I've got to get Ray to O'Hare...  Come on, let's hustle...  John!  Call American Express in Pittsburgh for Mr. Morton, will you, tell them he's on the one o'clock.
It's a common reaction, Jim.  I'll tell you what it is, and I know that that's why you married her. One of the reasons is prudence. It's a sizable investment.  One thinks twice...it's also something women have.  It's just a reaction to the size of the investment. Monday, if you'd invite me for dinner again...  This woman can cook...
To change our minds.
But I'm not counting it.  Wednesday.  Thursday.  Friday.  So it would have elapsed.
If we wait till Mon...
Yest...
I don't know.
It's not me, it's my wife.
I...
This.
She told me not to talk to you.
It's nothing.
You going to turn State's?
You did that?
Who's my pal...?  And what are you, Ricky, huh, what are you, Bishop Sheean?  Who the fuck are you, Mr. Slick...?  What are you, friend to the workingman?  Big deal.  Fuck you, you got the memory a fuckin' fly.  I never liked you.
And fuck you.  Fuck the lot of you. Fuck you all.
The...
To the restaura...what do you fucking...?
The word from Murray is: leave them alone.  If we need a new signature he'll go out himself, he'll be the president, just come in, from out of town...
Yes.
I didn't know the people who gave them to me.
I'm leaving very early tomorrow, before you wake up.
Some day you will.
She couldn't decide.
That scar-faced bastard will find out what we got from the wholesaler. He won't take a dime less than three hundred dollars.
I saw him with you.
Michael...
The children can stay.
Deanna, I'm going to belt you right in the mouth!
Mike, what can I do, she's a hysterical woman...
No, Dad.
That's how it was in the old world, Pop, but this is not Sicily.
I'm a little short.  I've been out of work.  Let me owe you the money for a few weeks.
We have a special home for you for the rest of your life.  Nobody gets near you.  You're not going any place.
I didn't turn against nobody; he turned against me.
Gotta check up on my boys.  Hey, what's with the food?  Some kid in a white jacket brings me a ritz cracker with some chopped liver. 'Canapes,' he says.  I say, 'Can a peas, my ass, that's a ritz cracker with chopped liver.' Go get me a salami sandwich and a glass of wine or I'll send you and your white jacket to the dry cleaners!
Pentangeli's dead.  He was ambushed by the Rosato Brothers.  Didn't you know that?
No.
It was hard to have him killed.
What's that?
Sincere.  What are you talking about, of course I'm sincere with you, Mike.
I know.  That's why I brought you with me!
Why?
How long does this go on?
She's gone, Tom.
I wanted to tell you alone; your wife doesn't know what's going on.
I know.  I went down to the Barrett house.  But she's gone.  They drove her and the kids to North Tahoe airport.
Just tell Rocco I'm waiting.
No Tom, just listen.  All my people are businessmen; their loyalty is based on that.  One thing I learned from my father is to try to think as the people around you think...and on that basis, anything is possible. Fredo has a good heart, but he is weak...and stupid, and stupid people are the most dangerous of all.  I've kept you out of things, Tom, because I've always known that your instincts were legitimate, and I wanted you to know very little of things that would make you an accomplice, for your own protection. I never blamed you for the setbacks the family took under Sonny; I know you were in a position of limited power, and you did your best to advise and caution him.  What I am saying is that now, for how long I do not know, you will be the Don. If what I think has happened is true; I will leave tonight, and absolutely no one will know how to contact me.  And even you are not to try to reach me unless it is absolutely necessary.  I give you complete power: over Neri... Fredo, everyone.  I am trusting you with the lives of my wife and children, and the future of this family, solely resting on your judgment and talent.
I took care of it.
My information is that Fredo thought it was a kidnapping.  Roth assured him nothing would happen to you.
It was a boy.
That plane goes to Miami...
Did my brother go back?
Tom, what do I do now?
Yeah, I still read a lot.  They bring me stuff.
Thanks, Tom.  Thanks.
We know you're a busy man, with plenty of enemies -- we saw the opportunity to do you a favor, and we did.  No strings.
Do you gamble?
The committee is adjourned until further notice.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Corleone.  We're not to let you through.
This is my boy, and my wife.  Mr. John Ola of Miami.
Tell me, Michael.  What really happened with Pentangeli?
And that's all he had to do.  Just show his face.
You would have killed his brother?
Well, we can all have a nice dinner together tonight.  How are your eyes?
You're a great man, Mr. Roth, I have much to learn from you.
The Rosato Brothers have performed services for you in the past; I understand that they are under your protection.
Technically, they are still under the Clemenza wing of the Corleone Family, now run by Frankie Pentangeli.  After Clemenza died, the Rosatos wanted territory of their own.  Pentangeli refused, and came to me, asking for permission to eliminate them.  I, of course, knew of their relationship with you, and in gratitude for your help with the Tropicana matter, turned him down.  Pentangeli was furious, and paid one hundred and fifty thousand dollars to have me killed. I was lucky and he was stupid. I'll visit him soon.  The important thing is that nothing jeopardize our plans, yours and mine.  This thing of ours, that we will build.
It means... &quot;The Lie.&quot;
You'll be there to see it; you'll be there.
Still no word of your courier? We'll find him.  But at least this will satisfy our friends here. You've been invited to the New Year reception at the Presidential Home. I understand your brother is here as well; I hope he'll come.
Who had Frankie Pantangeli killed?
Sure, I remember Tom from the old days.
Let him gamble.
No.  There are things that I have planned with Hyman Roth.  I don't want them disturbed.
Frankie, you know my father respected Roth, did business with him.
Then why do you want me to lay down to them?
Sure, Mike.  I'll go along.
And?
You wasn't listening, you didn't want to talk.
We want Brooklyn one hundred percent.  No more taxes to you.  We want to be only loosely connected with your family -- sort of a under-family all of our own.  Then we can act on all internal matters without talking.  Also we want you to inform Michael Corleone that we can deal directly with him.
Then Carmine Fucillo and Tony Blue DeRosa will need to be fitted for slabs.
We got friends in the commission.
What about Michael Corleone?
Maybe, yes... maybe no.
I say let loverboy watch his movie.  And be grateful Boone's not cutting Shirley Temple's lawn.
Maybe it's supposed to be funny.
Not so famous any of us have ever heard of him.
It means it's too cold to go swimming.  And I don't mean the water.
Yeah, and I'm never going to smoke another cigarette.
You will not hurt him?
No.  No.  I am sorry.  Forget everything I say.  Here.  I will take the tray.
Expect nothing fancy.
That's okay, Hanna.  I'm more comfortable in here.  It is Hanna, isn't it?
Long enough.  Fifteen years.
Your wife?
Why?
He is dead now, twenty years.
No!
I'm not going to hurt anyone.
I have brought you your clothes. All I ask is that you get dressed and go.  We are having a guest for breakfast.
It is my job.  I did it when he was happy and it was easy.  It is only fair I do it now when he is ill.  Enough talk.  I must wake up the master.
But how're you going to explain this?  How did you get him out of the pool?
Mornin'.
Nice place.
Just that I was in the Marines.
Yeah.  I better get on with my work.
No.  Iced tea's fine.
In my youth, yes, but never in Hollywood.  No, I was merely a director here.
Merely comfortable.  Here's Hanna with our refreshments.  Can you get the door?
Broke is more like it.
Excellent.  We'll have a most interesting time.
It's new.
I'm not wearing an undershirt.
No.  I'm fine.
I guess you'd say we lived on the wrong side of the tracks.
Did anyone laugh?
You ever been married, Mr. Whale?
It will only make you self-conscious.  You'll have to remove your shirt.
I'm fine.  I'd just rather keep it on.
I'd like to sit for you again.  But only if you ease up on the locker room talk.  Okay?
I don't know.  I guess I like your stories.
No harm done.
I'm game.  Sure.
Clayton is fine.
You don't have any baggy shorts? Pajama bottoms?
Do I have any other choice?
The Great War?
Is that why you joined the Marines? For your father's sake?
"A perfect night for mystery and horror.  The air itself is filled with monsters."
What was that?
Oh, but you feel good, Clayton.
I haven't done a damn thing with you!
Nothing I didn't deserve.
All right.
Hasta la vista, Boone.  And give the jail bait a squeeze for me.
Have a drink?
I thought I'd give you a hand since I kept you open.
It's the ridiculous pills they prescribe.  If I take them, I spend the next day stupid as a stone. If I don't, my mind seems to go off in a hundred directions at once --
You only embarrass yourself.
Yes.  Perfectly.
Nonsense, my dear.  You look extraordinary.  Today's script.  Quick.  And a pencil.
Bone?  Boom?  Something Bee.  I hire him while you were in the hospital.  He came cheap.
Luminal.
Don't be silly, Hanna.  He's a very proper actor.  And the dullest fellow imaginable.
She is beautiful.
I'll be fine, Hanna.  Thank you.
I'll be out this afternoon, remember?  Your family can visit as long as they like.
No.  I expect you can't.
Is it now?  Hanna?  I think we'll take our tea down by the swimming pool.
Quite.
What rumors might those be?
I interviewed him after I met you. I'm his social secretary now. Well, assistant to his secretary.
Don't think that, Mr. Whale.  I love your movies.  That's why I wanted you to come to this.  So I could see you with your monsters.
Fine.  Quite fine.  And Your Royal Highness?
About your brother. And the deeeep shit he's in --
Six years ...
Tell me about Kip -
A boost? What's Kip doing on a boost?
Who do you think?
And they still have the lowest rate of cancer of anywhere in the world. You know why? All they eat is seafood.
I do ...  Christ, what happened to us ?
No, but you dress like an asshole ...
Yeah Tell him to lay off Kip and them Tell him it's on
Yes ... Kip ...
"don't want" the Dodgers to lose or the summer to end. But we don't get to choose these things...
But I had to. It was the only way to get to you --
I don't know about that, Randall. He did such a good job on this paper. And another one just came in ...
What do you mean -- ?
How is he?
How's Atley -- ?
You know my back.
I don't know. But you shouldn't be here. Take care of your business. I'll give you 24 hours. And then I don't want to see your face. Ever again. Make a fool of me once, that's my bad. Make a fool of me twice. That's really my bad, and I'll kick your ass from here to India ...
Honestly? I want to - once every few months - get into my car. Pack a lunch. And drive on up to Chino. On visiting day. Bring you some magazines. Maybe some almond clusters. And see you all bright and shiny in your orange jumpsuit. That's what I want ...
Castlebeck.
Good.
Very good. Think you can get in without waking her up -- ?
Of course not. I'm Robin Hood. I take from the rich, and give to the needy...
Hell, yeah. Mirror Man here is our electronics expert. He's got some gadgets you old farts maybe never -heard of; Tumbler can drive anything with wheels, and some things without; Toby's a hacker, can do things with a computer, that are pretty amazing ...
Gray.
You know where the others are?
And there she is --
It's arright ...
Dignity...
Atley Jackson came to see me ...
Kipling was sixteen when you left, baby. I don't know what you remember of him. But you should brace yourself
NO! No, I can't! I'm a busy man.
Yes, sir -
"Carol." A 198 Mercedes ... She lives in the suburbs ...
Don't go there, Toby --
I think so. There's things I can't feel right now. Like my feet. But ... You think you can get me outta this, Memphis? I'd appreciate it -
Easy ... Take it easy ... We're almost there...
Yeah --
What do you got ... ?
What?
I can handle it --
Not really ... But you know... Maybe I'm wrong ...
I hear ya. Get me outta this. I'll move to the country. Open a fruit stand...
I dunno. Whatever will be will be...
What?
I know ...
Run it...
For real?
Hell, yeah. I'm not getting rich in here ...
Mitch.
No. You were replaced by Alex. Who was replaced by Kevin. Who was replaced by Vince. Who was replaced by Mitch...
Yes. But I got a feeling it's not on account of any longing-for-my-touch on your part -
If you change your mind. We're at Otto's. It's 50 ladies in 24 hours. For The Carpenter. 200 K and Kip's life on the felt. So long now ...
What's wrong with her -- ?
Yeah, well ... She lives with District Court Judge Seymour Croft ...
I put the boys on it. They're clever that way...
I always thought you'd follow me up.
No way ...
A little trick I picked up at the Car Thief Retirement Home ...
Her parole officer strongly recommended it ...
Shhh... Car thieves are your weakness.
I take out my slim-jim...
Wrong preposition...
What about The Club ... ?
Are you considering a comeback tour?
It can be done. Take two days to shop; one to prep. I'll offer up my bible for a small fee. You also have to hope Kip's jerk-circus didn't undo Castlebeck's linkage so much so that he's setting up surveillance teams on every city block. And then get yourself a crew...
And the moral of that story is -- ?
If we put out the word. That we're crewing-up, for a one-time-only job... What do you think that'll yield?
No we don't -
In order to succeed, you're going to have to go old-school. one night boost. Put all your nuts in one basket. And...
Sure. Hey, Toby. You grew up
So what's in there -- ?
Because you should be home with Nintendo, listening to The Spice Girls, little man ...
Not really --
I known Kip longing than you, man ...
No. Come on. It was the younger one that was the bad one.
Billy, how are you?
Me? Why would I get into that shit?
Why would I get into that?
Paulie. Why would I? I swear.
But, Paulie, I'm sorry. Believe me.  I was fucking crazy.  But I'm okay now. I can be trusted.  I'm clean now. On my children. Believe me! Two weeks cold turkey waiting for bail got my head together...
I thought you were going to stand me up. You looked bored. You didn't say anything. What did you expect. Tommy was all over me. Right?
What's the matter with you?  You're crazy.
What are you talking about?
Let her carry this shit inside.
I'm afraid. I'm afraid if Paulie finds out.
With what?
Just get me out.
You know. The stuff I left.
You what?
Bring the car round back. I know a place Upstate they'll never find him.
Who gives a fuck? Tall her he ran away with a broad. What do you care about her.
Yeah.
I remember feeling bad about the guy. But I remember feeling that maybe Tuddy was right.  I knew Paulie didn't want anybody dying in the building.
Yeah.
Keep him here. I'm going for a bag.
Will you get the fuck out of here.
Tommy  ...
He's a grown man. Be doesn't have to call every five minutes.
But, Paulie, please.
Paulie, I swear, I'm afraid. The guy's nuts. What do I have to do? Whatever I gotta do, I'll do.
Yeah.
Suck my cock!
--or a tail--
No one. I didn't have the number.
What do I look like, Al Cowlins?  You want to take my car, drop her off?
Oh I'm sure, that's why only one of us has herpes.
Week after I'm twenty-one.
Yeah, sit in a room and do long division for the next fifty years.
So, you ladies ah, go to school here?
Yah, it's not a bad school...
You could put a pool in that backyard.
NO SHE DIDN'T GET YOUR DOUBLE BURGER!! IT'S ALL FUCKIN' FLYIN' FISH FILET!!
What the fuck? I just asked you for a job yesterday!
Yeah, he was probably drunker than my Uncle, who fuckin' knows? So the cop goes "Stay here" And he goes runnin' down the highway to deal with the other crash. So, my Uncle Marty's standin' on the side of the road for a little while, and he's so fuckin' lit, that he forgets what he's waitin' for. So he goes, "Fuck it." He gets in his car and drives home.
The fuckin' Trooper was so embarrassed he didn't do anything. The fuckin' guy had been drivin' around in my Uncle's car all night lookin' for the house.
You thought we forgot, didn't you? I know I'm gettin' my licks in.
--These circumstances are mitigated. Right now. They're mitigated.
Well, you'd be working on the cutting edge. You'd be exposed to the kind of technology you couldn't see anywhere else because we've classified it. Super string theory, Chaos Math, Advanced algorithms--
The limit is not found!  The limit is not found.
Well, he didn't show up for work today...
Half-red, half-black--
An integer.
Yeah, when do I get my hypnosis? You guys been talkin' for twenty minutes.
Oh, come on! You're not pinnin' this one on me. He left, I wanted to talk to him for another twenty minutes. I was havin' fun.
I don't know what it's called.
I'm pretty sure it's right.
I'll cancel every meeting right now. I'll give you a job myself. I just wanted you to see what was out there.
Sure, then you'd have more time to sit around and get drunk. Think of how many fights you could have been in by now.
So am I.  Yes. That's right, Will. Most days I wish I never met you. Because then I could sleep at night. I wouldn't have to walk around with the knowledge that someone like you was out there. And I wouldn't have to watch you throw it all away.
I did.
Since Nancy died.
This kid's special, Sean. I've never seen anything like him.
It's on the college.
I'll be okay.
Tom.
I been here a couple years.
Cutting edge mathematics. Think tanks. The kind of place where a mind like Will's is given free reign.
Who?
Now wait a minute, Gerry--
Is it Gerry? 'Cause I don't think it's fine with you. Give him time to figure out what he wants.
"Undermine?"
--And why does he hang out with his friends? Because any one of those kids would come in here and take a bat to your head if he asked them to. It's called loyalty!
That's it. That's why I don't come to the goddamn reunions! Becaue I can't stand the look in your eye when you see me! You think I'm a failure! I know who I am. I'm proud of who I am. And all of you, you think I'm some kind of pity case! You with your sycophant students following you around. And you Goddamn Medal!
Come in.
Yeah. Summer vacation. Thought I'd travel some. Maybe write a little bit.
Sounds good.
The boy was here. He came in, sat down and we worked together.
Had one, now I'm fucked again.
Like what, Will?
How about the ones on that shelf?
285.
No.
You've never been out of Boston.
I don't know.
Haven't called her.
Well I think that's a wonderful philosophy, Sean. That way you can go through the rest of your life without having to really know anyone.
No, I don't.
Yeah.
You should have seen this girl. She lit up the room.
I guess.
What did I think?
Yeah.
If you won't answer my questions, you're wasting my time.
Look, a lot of that stuff goes back a long way.  And it's between me and him and it has nothing to do with you.
You're not going to fail me are you?
--No, have you had any experience with that?
Cause fuck him, that's why.
It's not your fault.
Yeah, I think so.
I'm gonna travel a little bit, so I don't know where I'll be.
See, it's my life story. Five more minutes and I would have got to hear your best pick-up line.
Okay...
You know what I mean. I know you've at least thought about it.
You know, nothing special.
Not a chance.
Bullshit.
Your house must have been a zoo.
Do you know all their names?
Do you keep in touch with them?
We'll do that.
I'm supposed to understand this.
Exactly.
They don't come over here that much.
Then on behalf of my weiner, I'd like to ask for an advance.
Clearly.
So, do you play the piano?
What do you mean "What am I afraid of?"
No, you don't want to hear that.
You trying to tell me how to run my own business?
Joe!
But ef you *do* whup me, I swear you better not ever go to sleep again, because the minute you go to sleep, or you're settin' down, or your back's turned, I'm gonna knock you belly-up with a bucket.
Well, you ain't a-goin'! Ain't *nobody* else a-goin'! We *got* here an' we gonna *stay* here, together! As long as we got the fambly unbroke I ain't scared, but it's a long bitter road we got ahead of us--  --an' I'm here to tell ya ef anybody else tries to bust us up anymore I'm a-goin' cat wild with this here piece a bar-arn!
I'll get Rosasharn.
Now I can't breathe.
Well, we ain't out a it yet.
Gallon or two?
Banana cream, pineapple cream, chocolate cream--and apple.
Sure, but what is this?
Four.
Okay, mister. Whatcha payin'?
Two an' a half! Say, mister, a man can't make his dinner on that.
Got a warrant?
Are you aimin' to tell me that the fellas that run this camp is jus' fellas--campin' here?
Anything like work aroun' here?
Crate fell on me.
Ought to be. That's fact'ry liquor. Cost me a buck.
No, but I aim to before sundown. Gettin' kind of excited about it, too. Which way you going?
I never heard nothin' about it.
I ain't no preacher anymore.
I don't know.
I ain't gonna run.
No, but--but you seen that advertisement in the Spicy Western Story magazine. Don't pay nothin'. Jus' send 'em the coupon an' you're a radio expert--nice clean work.
Save your strength, lady.  Get goin', buddy. No campin' here.
Pull up behind that car.  Okay for this one. Take 'em through.
Little trouble up ahead, but you'll get through. Just follow the line.
But this is *my land*, son. Don't you understand?
Why don't you get to it, buddy?
Me neither. I'm just tryin' to get along without shovin' anybody around, that's all.  See that road up ahead?
This here's a strike.
I didn't bust out. They lemme out. Howya, Noah. Howya, Uncle John.
'S all right, Grampa. You just kind a tar'd, that's all. Somebody fix a pallet.
No longer'n we can get acrost her.
No. No, it don't. I can't do that. I can't let m'self. All I can do is see how soon they gonna wanta eat again. They'd all get upset if I done anymore 'n that. They all depen' on me jus' thinkin' about that.  That's my part--that an' keepin' the fambly together.
Why, sure. It won't be so bad once we get her washed out.
This got a floor. Wouldn't leak when it rains.
No'm.
I know, honey, an' just as soon as we get settled Al's gonna set out an' look for him. How 'bout gas, Tommy?
An' you won't let nobody touch me?
She'll be awright.
We *got* to, Tommy. But that's gonna be awright. I seen the han'bills, about how much work they is, an' high wages, too. But I gotta fin' out somepin' else first, Tommy.  Did they hurt you, son? Did they hurt you an' make you mean-mad?
That's right. And douse some in it.
Thank God!  An' we're still together-- most of us.
You gotta keep clear, Tom. The fambly's breakin' up. You *got* to keep clear.
They know what--this fella looks like?
Okay, Ma. I shouldn't, though. I know I shouldn't. But okay.
Girl with a baby *always* gets prettier.
It had to come, I reckon, soon or later.
Awright, Tommy. What you figger you gonna do?
Would you--could you see your way to cuttin' off ten cents worth?
I don't wanta rob you, ma'am.
Won't they come out here?
Why, she wasn't no more'n a kid when I went up.
Not be so lonesome, either, knowin' his name is there with 'im, not just' a old fella lonesome underground.
Aw, sure. This here's jus' a part of it. Ain't no sense a gettin' scairt right off.
Tom, I jus' don't feel like nothin' a tall. Without him I jus' don't wanta live.
Keep qui'te, will ya! Shet your mouth!
Well, I reckon you *stan'* in them little rooms--an' water come down outa that there little jigger up there--take a bath!
I work at Kentucky Fried Chicken.
I'm Martin Blank.
Whatever I can get away with.
What?
Overflowing with love.
Yes.
Since you stood me up on prom night and vanished without saying a word?
Well, you'll have a ball. You seem to have everything everybody wants when they go back. The car, the suit, the watch. The look. That just leaves the little things, like happiness, character, point of view...
Well, there's not much to tell.
As long as I get the laugh.
Like heroin?
Yes.
Let me help you along, Martin. You're a sociopath!
I'll hide.
I just know.
If I get antsy I'll kill a few small animals.
Take a deep breath and realize, that this is me breathing.
I work alone.
I'm setting up a concern that would enable those of us in our rarefied profession to consolidate our efforts.
I know what I do isn't moral, per se, but if you could just look past that, you'd see a man worth loving.
Okay.
Hey, Bob.
That sounds pretty interesting...
I guess.
Seventeen months ago I was posting a walk in Lisbon, and he was there. He never saw me. But I saw him, though.
In fact, I think I talked with him, in Bonn.
Do his job? I'm not a cold-blooded killer.
Yup.
This?
I'm not happy.
Yes. It's the same as usual. Nothing remarkable about it at all.
Yeah. I guess we did.
I think I'll go see Debi today.
Paul?
Same thing that happened to you-- I stopped poutin' there on the sidelines. Got in. Got on the team. I joined the working week, you slick fucking asshole, so why don't you valet park your high horse and take it easy on your old buddy, Paul.
Look, even if it was nearer, that's just not what I do. I give clinics. And I'm not even doing them for a while. I'm heading back to Montana right now. I got a ranch to take care of...
You mean you hauled him all the way out here? Just like that?
Need a lift?
He'd be grateful, he'd take real good care with you.
No, ma'am, I'm afraid that's extra.
Yeah, it's been a while, but I... I remember the basic ideas...
Well, he don't know that. Just sit the horse.  Good... You have a nice seat.
College. In Illinois. She was playing the cello. I hadn't heard cello music growing up. She had the reddest hair, the bluest eyes. When she played, it was...
She was never really happy here. She did the best she could.
We did at one point. When we thought we'd have more children. And we after tried. We tried everything, but... wasn't meant to be.
Not really. I'd forgotten how long it's been since I've done this. And I couldn't get any Parmesan cheese.
What?!
I can't even get out of bed yet! You're already putting me in therapy!!
I don't want to lie down. I've been lying down enough.
-- enough time tomorrow. I know.
Fine.
You're amazing! You act like I don't live in that house! Don't you think I hear the two of you!? Don't you think I can tell what's going on? I'm not five years old, Mom!  You want to divorce Daddy and Daddy doesn't want to.
He doesn't have to! It's, like, so obvious you can't stand him.
No, you just act like you do.
There was supposed to be a turn off. Did I miss it?
I'll take care of it.
FOR YOU! Because I'm your daughter which means you're the best mother! Isn't that what you're always talking about in interviews -- having it all, the great career, the great family... Proving everybody wrong. Wanting everybody to think you're this perfect woman!
Uh, nothing. I'm going to pick it up in the other room -- would you hang this up for me?
Well... honey... you know... that's just not his way. Maybe you can write him a letter or something. Say thank you... Don't think about it... You take care and I'll see you home.
Go ahead...
Who's there?
Is that absolutely necessary? It'll just make it a bigger story.
I love you.
About us going someplace warm... Someplace Grace'll have to wear shorts or bathing suits or summer dresses...
Robert, Grace isn't adjusting to school. And she can't sit in this apartment all day... I think it would be good for her.
He'll be sedated. I know horses, Robert. I'm the one who taught Grace how to ride.
No, that's not what I said. I'm not a dictator. If you feel you should come, then come. Just do whatever you think is right.
You know, I just asked that myself tonight. He doesn't know.
Let's not talk about that now.
Mmm. I made good time.  Pilgrim's in the back. I found a new stable, but they can't take him until tomorrow.
You want to take a walk with me?
Oh, it's... I wanted to tell you that, if you'd like, you being so busy, I could take Grace to her therapy exercises for you. I have to go in once a week for shopping anyway.
I'd love to go there one time...
No, it's more like a leave of-  Ha, ha, ha. Yeah, they fired me.
I fell in love. After that, I never thought about being anything but a rancher's wife. I never saw it like I was losing some other life, just felt like I was gaining one. I know that's not a popular opinion nowadays and I ain't saying it's the right one. We all have to find the life meant for us.
He's a good man, Tom is. He's got a gift, come from heaven above, I swear. But he's still a man. And a woman can lead a man into the middle of a mountain lake -- and still make him think he's on dry land.
Her leg was shattered so they had to, uh... remove it. She had some bleeding but it's under control.
I understand, but Annie, please...
You!
What, they ain't going forty miles into Choteau everytime they want a hamburger.
That's what some folks say.
You know her?
He thought it was a ghost.
Drive? I'm not old enough yet.
I don't know if I can.
What does that mean?
You want to go to a movie tonight?
No, wait, it just goes... "he said he liked to do-"...
I'm okay... I'm okay.
No, I'm just not that hungry.
I know. Amazing.
YA JUST HAD A TURN. IT WAS NOT.
I understand...
Fit? You want to check my teeth.  Good crowd today. I think you'll have some fun. You going to stay for dinner?
Honey... I was always good.
What do you mean?
Yeah, cool.
I'm sorry, sir. We caught him by surprise, so we don't think he had time to erase his computer files.
Alright sir.
...IF it weren't run by a bunch of profiteering gluttons!
Check this out. It's a memo about how they're gonna deal with those oil spills that happened on the fourteenth.
I want it.
Look at this, it's so lean and clean.
Yo, man, you an amateur, man.
Yo, brain dead, the manual!
A worm AND a virus? The plot thickens.
Look, you wanna be elite? You gotta do a righteous hack. None of this accidental shit.
Ain't no way, man, security's too tight. The big iron?
Never send a boy to do a woman's job. With me, we can do it in seven.
No, don't know who he is.  Do you?
Right. If I win, you wear a dress on our date.
Well, yeah, I just haven't found one as charming as you yet.
Right, mom. And I'm still a virgin!
Hmmm.
No. No one special.
And unpack.
I got it. But listen, Kate didn't know what's on it. I mean, she came to me to figure it out. She's not the one who planted the virus. You leave her alone.
Razor and Blade.
And judging by this segment alone, it's already eaten about...
My... class. You mean I'm not in your class?
P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.
Are you challenging me?
I didn't know what was on it.
It's somehow connected with the worm that's stealing the money.
You would have looked better.
Norman? This is Mr. Eddie Vedder, from Accounting. I just had a power surge here at home that wiped out a file I was working on. Listen, I'm in big trouble, do you know anything about computers?
Sorry, I can't help you, okay?
No. He's either very smart or very stupid.
Red handed! You won't be having any more trouble from them.
What's going on? Let go of me! Stewardess! I'll never fly this airline again!
You know, you're right about that.  Check it, Friday.
Nono, it's like hot or something. I don't know.
I copied it from Ellingson, okay? They're asking me about it, alright? Will you take a look for me?
I'm sorry, we're sorry, just checking out your fly laptop!
Relax, Burn, he's my guest.
Yeah. Whose gonna notify his next of kin?
Real charmer.
Jamie needs a Halloween costume.
This morning.
Oh really? Well, I'll just let you get back to little Ms. Hot panties.
No. You son of a bitch!
Loomis, it's over. Leave it alone.
Its too late.
You guys always look great.
I know, and next to that is the police, hospital, fire, and probably National Guard.
Susan broke her ankle last night at the ice rink  Rachel?
I'm Dr. Hoffman, Medical Administrator.
Drive Carefully.
Do you love me Rachel?
Like a real sister?
Your mother used to baby-sit me when I was your age.  I bet you didn't know that.
I'm sorry I ruined everything. If I wasn't here you could go out.
I don't want to.
Double scoops?
You ready for some Ice Cream?
You bet.
He's coming to get me Rachel.
Yeah, hurry up.
No way! Halloween's great. Can we stay out all night?
No.
Hi Jamie.
No. Brady's working there till 6:00 today.
I don't want to look pushy.
Well I don't want to come on too strong. A guy hates a girl to come on strong. Fragile egos and all of that.
The Corruther's house. That's where Jamie lives, that's where he'll go.
Yeah in the trunk of my squad.
He's been here.
It isn't a man.
They've survived this ordeal, they'll survive it's memory.
Gods Country, Promise Land. Where are you heading Mr..ah
Calm down. Calm down. Are you all right? Are you all right?
Hi, Dad. What happened?
Old jerko got caught throwing eggs and soaping windows. His parents grounded him for the weekend. He can't come over tonight.
Terrific. I've got three choices. Watch the kid sleep, listen to Lynda screw, or talk to you.
Why did you hang up on me?
Now you hear obscene chewing. You're losing it, Laurie.
I wasn't spooked.
I saw someone standing in Mr. Riddle's back yard.
What's this big, big news?
I'd say you must have the wrong number.
This has not been my night. My clothes are in the wash, I spilled butter down the front of me, I got stuck in a window...
I can't.
Then why are you sitting here with half the lights off?
Yeah.
May be a few minutes. I gotta stick around here...
Could have...
I'll stay out with you tonight, Doctor, just on the chance that you're right. And if you are right, damn you for letting him out.
Three blocks down. Get in the car and go up that other street and then back down here. I'm going up the block.
Totally.
Nothing. I was just sitting down for the first time tonight.
Sure.
I'm so embarrassed. I couldn't face him...
Do you believe everything that Richie tells you?
There was no one outside.
Tommy, let me in!
I killed him...
Will you get her for me?
You can get back on the telephone and tell them exactly what walked out of here last night. And tell them where he's going.
He was doing all right last night. Maybe somebody around here gave him lessons.
He'll barely be able to sit up.
Only minimum security.
Come in, come in.
Mmm?
Well, let's hope so.
Oh.
Well, let's do it.
A lot of works.
Oh, in this we're a big hit. Yesterday I auditioned for Come Back Little Sheba.  That, I wasn't such a big hit.
Oh, is that what it is?
Okay.
Right.
Do you remember that summer in France?  Hannah, you had jet lag for six straight weeks.
Okay, Norman, listen, I really want to talk about this at home.  I think it's a matter for your analyst...and mine.
I cry at the opera.
Yes.
This time I really think I have something.
Let's take a look.
Yes, now-now that you mention it, uh, I-I-I have, uh, buzzing and also ringing.  Ringing and buzzing. Um, am I going deaf, or something?
I told him about your work, and he's very excited.
Yeah?
Read the papers!  Half the country's doing it!
...cannot go on the air.
...ex-husband on the street the other day.
Oh.  Well, I live--
Oh, God.
No?
I'm...all right.
Oh, yes.  Who doesn't?  Look!
Oh, no, I can't let you get me that. That's too much.
Uh, uh, this is great.  I mean, I love e.e. cummings, but I can't let you get this.
Bye.
Oh, yeah, that's really nice of you.
Lee!  Lee!  Lee, I'm in love with you.
Oh, don't say those words!
Wh-- She's never said anything, and we're very close.  She'd tell me such a thing.
Yes!  But I...I have certain feelings for you, but don't make me say anything more, all right?
Look, don't do anything on my behalf.  I live with Frederick, and Hannah and I are close.
I didn't sleep all night.
I promised myself I wouldn't let this happen till you were living alone.  I was so torn when you called.
Oh, all the time.
Yes, she's, she's very warm, but, but it-it's me that wants to be giving to you.  I-I-I want to do things for you.  Hannah doesn't need me as much.  I'm being presumptuous.  Not that you need me.
If-if-if you can believe I have such feelings for you!
Ah, it's over!  Elliot, I mean it. It's over!
I know.
I don't know.  Um...I'm just antsy.
Was I?
Well, I-I don't think it's a very good idea.
I don't know.
But, you got four children!
Well...I-I think we should wait till things settle.
What kind of interrogation... Su- supposing I said yes?  I-I-I am disenchanted.  I am in love with someone else.
No!  But you keep asking these, these awful questions.  My God, it's-it's like you want me to say yes!
Get his wine away.
But Catholicism?  Why not your own people?
I know it sounds funny, but I'm gonna try.
So, just 'cause I was born that way... You know, I'm old enough to make a mature decision.
That thought doesn't terrify you?
They're in the basement.
You missed a very dull TV show about Auschwitz.  More gruesome film clips...and more puzzled intellectuals declaring their mystification over the systematic murder of millions.
Don't say that!  I don't want to hear that word!  Don't mention that while I'm in the building.
You--I got the classic symptoms of a brain tumor!
Can I tell you something?  Can I tell you a secret?
I went into a store, I bought a rifle.  I was gonna... You know, if they told me that I had a tumor, I was going to kill myself.  The only thing that mighta stopped me, might've, is my parents would be devastated.  I would, I woulda had to shoot them, also, first.  And then, I have an aunt and uncle, I would have... You know, it would have been a bloodbath.
I can't stay on this show.  I gotta get some answers.  Otherwise  I'm telling you, I'm going to do something drastic.
Oh, now--
I'm-I'm okay.  Yeah, I-I-I, you know, I...I'm just, um, I got dizzy all of a sudden.  I'm-I'm...I have a headache.
I got two minutes.
He's fine.
H-he's so awkward and he's clumsy like me...
Oh!
Wow!
Is there no chance?
Th-th-they, they wanted me for a screen test.
Yeah.
Well, how about this?
Uh-huh.
You got it.
Well-well, like what?
Yeah, that's clerical.
I'm not!  I'm not!  I'm trying to be helpful.  A person doesn't just say one day, "Okay, now-now I'm finished as an actress.  Now I'm a writer."  I mean--
I don't see how you could know about these things unless Elliot's been talking to you.
I can't hear you.  I can't hear anything.  I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm gonna lose hearing in my ear!  I'm--
Do you mind?  I'm-I'm my own person.
Well, if you didn't like it, you didn't like it, but you didn't have to talk while the guy was singing.
I remember you.
We didn't hit it off.
I'm fine.
You look wonderful.  You do.  What happened to you?
Oh.  Oh.
I'm-- Yes.  Yes, I'm fine.  I'm fine.  How are you?
Hmm.
It's great.  I swea-- I'm-- I'm, tch, I'm speechless.  I was...I was not in the mood to listen to this thing now.  I don't know what to say.  I'm moved and I laughed and I-- Uh, I, you know, I was on the edge of my seat.  I just think it's wonderful! I'm, I'm totally...stunned.  This is not an insult.  I'm amazed that you can...  It was-- I just thought it was great.
It was just great.  Uh, I was all set...I was set to be bored stiff.
Well...  I'll tell you.  One day about a month ago...
Oh, yeah?  What?
I was the, I was... You know, it was my fault.  I--
You know, I was talking with your father before...and I was telling him that  it's ironic.  I-I used to always have Thanksgiving with Hannah...and I never thought  that I could love anybody else.  And here it is, years later and I'm married to you  and completely in love with you.  The heart is a very, very resilient little muscle.  It really is.  I...  It'd made a great story, I think. A guy marries one sister...  doesn't work out...  many years later...  he winds up  married to the other sister.  It's, you know, it's a...
Hmm.
Yeah, okay, right.  Forget it.  What's to eat?
Take our literature...
...read it over, and think about it.
You're welcome.  Hare Krishna.
I'm on the track of a reward, which...
They're offering...
<u>What</u> is this, a whorehouse, or are you my <u>wife</u>?
...I was <u>working</u>...
Then why did you chose to <u>inform</u> me of it...?
Or, perhaps...
I'm struck by your phraseology.  I did not <u>last</u> with him.  I was privileged to enjoy his company during that time.
Let's just say they got a passion for collectibles...
Not as much as being jailed for theft of Government Property, or for failure to pay income tax, on undisclosed income.
...they did it for a lark.
Rich, comic book freaks.
And have <u>you</u> found Peace..?
COULD I GET A <u>DRINK</u>,  N'I don't <u>care</u>, you see, what all they got me doin, for I'd rather be doin' <u>makework</u>, than be doin' <u>pub'l'relations</u> with THE DIRTY DOZEN, one <u>Hispanic</u>, one <u>Librarian</u>, one <u>Jew</u>, and One from Column A, and One from Column...  Thank you.
All y'got to do is <u>ask</u>...
Yeah, so where is he?
Somewhere in Italy.
...then we won't need to tether Miss Starling as our lure.
Follow Starling, stake out Starling. Increase the pressure on Starling.  He will come to her.
No.  And...
...yes, if you'll, just step <u>away</u>...
I... think... he was.... he was <u>touched</u>, by your reaction.  To his appearance.
...Mr. Verger would be pleased to make a contribution, to the charitable...
...young boys, still...?
I can make you rich.
Come on, stay with us.  Look here:  I could get behind you, and give you a <u>spinal</u>, tomorrow, you wuunt feel <u>anything</u> down there, a l'il <u>pulling</u> is all.  N'I'll tell you <u>what</u>, after he's got his jollies, ten, f'teen minutes, I'll come down here, give you a shotta <u>this</u>  stop your heart, an that's <u>you</u> done, an there's an <u>end</u> to it.  What do you say...?  I know you got lotsa money, evabody says so.  I know how that stuff works, take it out, move it <u>around</u>...  ...stay with me now, <u>fuss</u> with it... Whatsay we call your banker now, tell him a <u>code</u>... move that money to me, he <u>confirms</u> it, and I fix you up Right Now...  Whatsay?
Come on, Doctor, <u>then</u> you can sleep...
Let the girl go.
Starling, I've ordered you to shut...
...what's he got against you?
You seen John Brigham...?
...standard issue...
Well, then--I wouldn't want to be taken for a <u>hobbyist</u>...
He requests your presence, once again, as part of...
I think its meaning is clear.
That could be.
Well, you know <u>my</u> name, honey, but <i>I</i> don't know <u>yours</u>...
Hey, you know, I never thought of that...
Of course, <u>in</u> his offices, if you come across anything, any personal papers of his, anything, however trivial, would you contact me, please... Are his personal effects still at the Palazzo?
I wonder no longer.  You were out of the country.
Indeed I am.  And the connection, between Dante, and, in fact, between your illustrious forebears... if you'd come with me, I could show you...
Yes, I think I amused them.  To what do I owe...?
Where do you live?
No.
Is it necessary to know?
Sir, with all due respect....
Sir, I'm in Law Enforcement, I was out there, dealing with an armed and dangerous...
You put my friend in the ground, with your mickeymouse <u>TaskForce</u>...  Izsat the kind of Headlines that Preserve and Promote, you, sir?
Thank you.  No, I know you'd prefer "I'm glad you <u>find</u> me so..."
You're <u>free</u>...
Yes, to cease to Hope is the Greatest Crime.  The Greatest crime.  Perhaps the <u>only</u> crime.  <u>I</u> never ceased to hope!
I want the <u>same</u> drink.  Cause it did me <u>good</u>... but I already drunk it, so, barring that, yes, I would like another.
Alcohol.  Where both its life-enhancing And its life destroying qualities...  ...not unlike some Hindu <u>God</u>...
What else's he goin to do with his day, he can't work, and he won't steal...
That's what I should do.  Tell me why?
Yeah, but who would marry friendless <u>me</u>...  Howabout you, Romeo...?
...not to turn around.
You're going to <u>do</u> that?
Saying what, "Look out for a guy with ten fingers...?"
N'not <u>that</u> sad.
Y'want to gimme Brigham's pistol?
Yes, yes, yes, your thirty thousand dollars reward, which you would have to split with your team, which, <u>if</u> you get it, will not buy me a new <u>watch</u>...
Because we cannot <u>pay</u>...
And why should we believe you?
No, y'know, I never <u>doubted</u> it...
I'm sure there is, but my young Friend here, would <u>kill</u> you.
No,I get it, this is my <u>Cavalier</u>.  This gents my Italian Knight.  Take <u>this</u>...  For this shall be my gage, and you can take it into battle.
Or clear your windshield with it.
Brazilian.
...yes, yes, yes....
No.  That's right.  That's all part of it.
...no...
Yes, so you said.  But what does that mean:  to go beyond The Institution.
...would you use a small word?
Welcome to the human race.  Do you know, there are people who admire you?  Reasonable people.  Why don't you <u>find</u> them...?
I want to do something <u>positive</u>...
And you have been <u>dreaming</u>... dreaming about this Hat, and...
No, sir, it's not my job to capt... why do you say how terrible?
And this Peepers was your...dog?  If it makes you feel better, I probably wasn't paying attention.
Well, uh...Promise me you won't do anything until you're 18.
I was pretty confident that I was going to blow it with Talia, but I must say, I outdid myself.
Uh, yeah, that's...wow.
Say Hi for me.
Wha-at?  What is it?
You guys have been so colossal...
Goodnight.
Thanks a lot. Seriously though, by winning this bet, you will prove to the world that you indeed know everything.  Isn't the rush of gambling on your cynical philosophy of life enough?
You and Wichita go to school together, right?  Have you two ever...
I just don't know about this whole actual sexuality thing--How do you go from being friends with a guy to wanting to put the thing he uses to go to the bathroom with in your mouth?
Ooh look, time to confiscate my first water balloon...

It's been known to happen.
Shut the fuck--!
Shoot.
So what was the first day after Heather's suicide like?
Something like that. Will you do it?
I just want to show different kinds of people can get together and it doesn't have to be Vietnam. You don't get treated badly here do you?
Shit, Heather. I don't have anything against Martha Dunnstock.
Color me impressed. I thought you grew out of Betty Finn.
Whatever. I don't believe this. We're going to a party at Remington University tonight and we're brushing up our conversation skills with the scum of the school.
Don't tell me. Crest would be stained with loserness.
We made a girl want to consider suicide. What a scream. What a jest.
Don't worry. David says he's very so he's very.
You goddamn bitch!
Ku-urt, I ne-ed an orgasm.
Very very. The photographs?
Okay, I'm going, I'm going. Jesus...
Just shut up and turn on the radio. Hot Probs is on.
People love you but I know you. Jennifer Forbes told me the petition she signed was to put a jacuzzi in the cafeteria. And Doug Hylton...
But what about Heather and Ram and Kurt?
I don't really like your friends either.
You're welcome. It's a lot more interesting than just flinging off your clothes and boning away on the neighbor's swing set.
Heather Chandler is one bitch that deserves to die.
Man Veronica, pull the plug on that shit. I say we go with Big Blue.
Okay we'll use this. She won't be able to tell what she's drinking.
Yeah, great.
Same difference. Oh jesus, I'm gonna...
Stop kidding around. I'm going to have to send my S.A.T. scores to San Quentin instead of Stanford.
My Mom's making my favorite meal tonight. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.
I'm doing a favor for Heather. A double date. I tried to tell you at the funeral but you rode off.
Our love is God. Let's get a Slurpee.
Remember he's left-handed.
You kids are making too much damn noise.
I don't get it! You were wrong! I was right! Strength, damnit! Come back!
Nag, nag, nag, nag. nag.
You didn't say Simon Says.
What?
I thought I...you..
I still got to talk to Heather, dude. Weird funeral, huh?
Let's kick his ass.
I guess.
Great pate, but I'm going to have to motor if I want to be ready for the party tonight.
I'm lost. You don't get enough attention, you get too much attention. Which is it? Where are your shoes?
Where is he? Where's J.D.?
We're pretty handy with model making, too, eh?
Are you a carpenter, Mr. Rieper? HERBERT shakes his head.
Actually, Mr. Rieper . . . it's a novel, and we'll be sending it to New York. That's where all the big publishing houses are based.
pulls his coat on. HONORA gives him a peck cheek.
Have a nice outing, you lot.
Well . . . I better make myself a bit more presentable.
glows with pride. STEVE is emptying his pockets on the bench. HONORA pats STEVE's hand.
I just want to be on my own for a while.
You ran off with Dad when you were only 17! Nana Parker told me!
It's a letter from the school . . . from Miss Stewart.
I care . . . your father cares . . . we want you to have a good education.
I don't wanna be in bloody school!
Don't be so ridiculous. You're our daughter, you belong here with us.
and HERBERT exchange a glance. HONORA smiles at Juliet.
Oh, no . . . Mummy's awfully good at it.
gives her a sympathetic look.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Rieper. I'm feeling quite fatigued.
stands and picks up her handbag. Pauline stands and Juliet grabs her hand.
Thank you. I bought it especially, Mrs. Rieper.
turns around and Juliet presents her with a brown paper bag.
It doesn't matter.
I'm not! I'm going to the Fourth World! It's like Heaven, only better because there aren't any Christians.
Well . . . no. But it's so obvious.
I can try my father's safe. I'm sure I can get the keys to his office.
You just made that up.
Oh I knew about the chairs already. This is where the emphysema patients come to sneak cigarettes.
Well?
No you don't understand. That's why I've been fighting to get you better. So you wouldn't be a patient anymore.
I crap you not. She was all over me yesterday in the break room. And she was a total machine last night too.
Almost that fast. I got a few loose ends to tie up first. Came into a shitload of money recently. I've always wanted to go to take a trip. We're just gonna walk into the airport and decide right then and there.
Where's Allison?
I saw her drowning inside the car, detective.
How many zeros was your wife worth?
Sorry I just kind of... spaced for a second there.
Do I really want to know what you're talking about?
But... I thought...
What?
This isn't happening.
No please make yourself at home.
Where is she? Where is my wife?
What?
Thanks.
Well they'd have to prove it in a court of law for one thing-
I don't know who you are or what you want. I just want to know what's under that sheet...
All you've got is the here and the now Trevor. That's all anyone really has. Maybe this will make things easier to understand. A man goes to sleep every night and has recurring dream that he's a butterfly. In time he begins to wonder if he might actually be a butterfly who dreams he's a man. And at the end of the day does it even matter? All these events you're describing. How can you be sure any of them really happened?
Shh. It's okay son. There is but one truth. One thing you can be absolutely sure of. And that thing is this:
Surrender yourself... surrender yourself...
No, thanks I've got a... a date tonight-
I'm, uh, not sure... Feeling kind of weird actually.
Well now there's a compliment.
I... think we need to talk, there's something really strange going on...
Come on, quit fucking around. Listen it's about... what we did together last night.
In bad weather, yeah.  Mostly I camp out in the woods.  I thought maybe you were down on your luck too when I picked you up.
One leg!  Like the Red Cross or something?
LaPlante!
Talk from there.  You can talk from there.
I'm beginning to... be aware of that, John.  Listen, I'm not gonna do nothing heroic here, you can trust me on that, buddy.  Whaddaya say we just sit down for a while. I don't have no tricks, I'm not that smart.  You could, like, rest up for the jump.
Yeah, and with me it was like I was supposed to pretend the shoe was mine.
Are you pretty involved in his upbringing?
I think you should visit your son. And try and get your boss to write a note about your performance on the job.  You need to create the impression of a responsible, decent citizen with familial responsibilities who happened to slip up once.
You mean John Bubber?
Mister LaPlante...
You couldn't have a problem, Chick, because I personally have got them all.  I cornered the whole goddamn market.  You wouldn't believe... Oh, how ya doin'...?
I'm not gonna throw you out, Bernie.
It's a character thing, Bernie. I mean, you wouldn't do it.  No offense.  Me neither.  I mean, a guy like Bubber, he's a certain kinda guy.  Heroic.  You and me, we're not... heroic.  It's not our nature. It don't mean we're bad or nothing. We're just not so inclined.  What about it?
Down.  You mean jail?  For that credit card stuff?  For Chrissake, Bernie, your lawyer...
OUT!  I TOLDJA.  JESUS CHRIST, I GOT CUSTOMERS WAITING!  AN' YOU WERE GONNA GO OUT LIKE THAT?  AN' MEET THE PUBLIC IN STOCKING-FUCKING-FEET?
Maybe not,... but you let him believe it!  And then I gotta explain about the homeless...
Back to the jungle, Bernie.  Good night.
How did you acquire this, Mister LaPlante?
What's your scheme, Mister LaPlante? What are you forcing John Bubber to do?  What are you -- ?
Lie, you mean...
Me?  Listen, I don't give no interviews.  That was John Bubber. You wanna ask me questions, you could talk to my attorney, Miss O'Day.
Sometimes.  His name's Elliot.  He saved a guy's life one time.  In a fire.
Yeah.  I'll see ya... dad.
Uh, no.
That's not what I mean...
You're lucky, Chucky, you... OW!
This sofa is a lethal weapon.  The springs... are... the springs... what...?
"For Excellence in the Pursuit of Truth."
Unprofessional.
The story behind the story, the ugly scandal behind the falling millionaire, the dirt, you mean.
A "mystery guy!"  "Not a passenger." Who?
It's a wonderful piece.  Emotional. I love it.
Drake Hotel, Penthouse Suite.  Never stop worrying.  I figure we'll do a sidebar on what it's like to go from sleeping in your car and collecting cans to sleeping in the poshest suite in town.  Also Gale's onto something, digging into his background.
Said he's not an actor.
What?
Half the time he don't answer even if he's home.  Know why?  'Cause he don't want no bill collectors to find him.  I don't mean to be judgmental, but he's a scumbag. He don't have no friends.  Who's gonna like a creep like LaPlante? I was doin' him a favor on the TV outta kindness, and he screwed me. You know what color skin you get on my set, Miss Gayley?  Purple! That's what color skin you got on the tee vee LaPlante sells me!
Look at the guy!  He just saved fifty people.  Now he's going to disappear. Who is he?
Don't be ridiculous.  I'm a reporter.
Reporters... have to... rise above their hormones.
Who?
So this really does the trick, eh?
They're really white.
Let's watch some TV.
Oh -- uh -- girlfriend.
Well, I've been doing a little independent contracting, some carpentry here and there, y'know, do-it-yourself-type stuff.  I still find it very soothing.
Yeah, since I was a kid.  I had a woodwork class once when I was... in school that time.  Then I learned a lot more when I was in the --
Actually, I have met someone. There's a woman I think I like.
<u>Ask</u> her how she feels.
Yeah, that was easy.
-- General handyman, yeah.  I do carpentry, too, painting, almost any odd job around the house.  I do housesitting while the owners are away.  In fact, that's why I've been in the area.  I've been living very close by.  Here's the part that's giving you trouble, but I won't be able to get a replacement till the stores open tomorrow morning.
Yeah, I've always been able to make my way in the world.  I don't like having to rely on other people.
I was alone a lot as a child.  No one to compete with.  My parents ensured that I found happiness in the smallest things.  When you're all alone it's your own world, you don't have to take orders from anybody.  You don't necessarily believe the stories people tell you.
Uh huh.
About us.
'Who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf, the Big Bad Wolf...'
Well, what do you want me to do, Rita -- I can't just forget fifteen years of marriage.  Well, of course I know <u>you</u> can.  No, Rita, I -- what was that?  -- oh, I thought I heard something on the line.
No, I told you.  A whiff of perfume on his shirt.
He'll never appreciate it more.
Mom, I heard someone downstairs!
High end?  Honey, it's a whole new budget.
You wanted furniture too, didn't you?
Honey, nobody buys a house overnight -- if someone else comes back at them, well, we might have to make a counter offer.  But we can't look too eager or we'll get screwed.
Damn.
What?
What?
One day before we know it it'll be an old house and we'll be old in it -- and I'll still be paying for it.
He's made some friends, hasn't he?
I know someone else who's sensitive.
Honey, you know what I've been like lately... I've been a total zombie.  I have no idea what that was doing in my pocket.
Did you lock the garage door?
There might be some extras in the garage.
Yeah -- we know him.  He's been hanging around the house.
Isn't it?
Oh, space!  -- You said the right thing.
The thermometer's broken.
Neil, goddamn it, you're not five years old!
Get on the other side of that.
Thank you -- how efficient of you.
Really.
Not now.  I'm busy.
Yes.
It's not a homicide, Lieutenant.
We sent the prints we lifted from the counter at the bank to the State computers, the FBI and interpol. Nothing.
Cut him loose.  The D.A. says you ain't got shit on this guy.
Aye.
Who are you?
Are you always this pleasant?  You know what you're problem is?
I'm sure they will.
If it came down to it what would you do?
No.  What am I to do?
No -- I will.
That doesn't matter.
It is.  Do not ask me how.  I do not know.  I must leave, for if I stayed others would surely hear of this and worse than they will come.
I would like to say goodbye.
Where do you go when your mind drifts?
Aye.
Are you a cop?
A lucky guess.
I'll be fine.
Because it's my name.
I don't know anymore.
You remind me of someone I used to know.
You look like you have.
Why?
Why?  Because I don't give up all my secrets?
No.
--for three hundred years.
--the crest of a lion and a dragon and a single word:  Courage.
It will end tonight.
Then we shouldn't break into the cavern until tomorrow morning.  This could be a very important find.  I want it documented.
That's what the Kurgan said.
It will not end tonight.
Aye -- that I would, lass.
You also have a power, Conner.  It is why you have survived.
I haven't lived life -- I've hidden from it.  I've existed in the shadows.
If you search your heart you know all the good you have done.  Your strength comes from your heart -- because in your heart you know what you are fighting for is good and just.  This room is filled with memories. If you search through them you can find the good -- the difference you have made.  And now, it is for you to make the greatest difference of all. Look in your heart, Conner -- and you will see the good that you have done.
Good afternoon...  ... Shirley.
I think he's dead!
It's me, Chief.  Can you talk?
Jesus Christ, it's a clusterfuck.
Yes, sir.  But what about the disks?  If the cops end up with the disks, we're gonna see a whole lot of heat.
What do you want to do?
I understand.
I'll make the call.
He knows better than that.
You think we should take that chance?
I guess not, too.  How much information is in the house?
If the Feds get those disks, the East Coast is gonna take a hit, too.  You should let them know.
You won't die if you let me help.
We got jobs, man; we're working.  Why even take the chance?
Are you totally stupid?  What does it look like?
We had an awful lot of shooting.  You need a doctor in there?
Let me speak to Mr. Smith.  I want to hear it from him.
The Mexican police would arrest you as soon as it landed.  There's only one way out and you're doing it right now--just keep talking to us.  I think we could make the transition now. Maddox, you good to go?
I'm going to put on an officer named Will Maddox.  You talk to him for a while.
Use more ice.
Aw, Jesus, not more of this.
Who gives a shit, Mars?  Check out the cash!  We're rich.
Find something:  Extension cords, rope, wire--we'll have to tie them tight.
Dennis.
I like it here, Dennis.  I'm never going to leave.
Okey-doke.
What do you mean?
Goddamnit, tell me what you <u>know</u>.  Did the cops go in?  Did Smith have the disks?
Mr. Jones is dead.  So are two of his men.  The other three are in jail.  I have the disks.  I have Walter Smith. And you know what, you motherfucker?  I have you.
Yeah.
Where is it?
Don't worry about it.  How are you doing?
You sure?
Shh, they'll hear you!
I don't drink beer.
We can't make the microwave work.
I don't see why you can't just lock me in.  It's not like I can go anywhere.
All three of us will go, but we have to move fast.  Mars and Dennis don't know I'm doing this.
Another minute.  Please --
We have a boy on the line.  He says he's Thomas Smith and he's calling from the house.
If we have a man dying in there, we'll have to go in.
Run a DMV on the plate for the owner's name.
You used to be a cop.  All of you used to be cops.  I can tell by the way you move.
They've been in there all day.
Dennis hit him.  His head's all big and he won't wake up.  I'm really scared.
Yes, sir.
I opened Marlon.  I think it's somebody's taxes.
Try Al.  See if you can open Al.
Yes.
Your phony FBI assholes.
They're killing everyone. The Lady Minister! The UN soldiers. They're at the gate.
We, who is we?
I'll be back.
I am Paul Rusesabagina, a good friend of General Bizimungu.
Where is your family?
How many in your family?
And four children?
Yes we have.
Canadian Club?
It's a single malt, Glenmorangie. I thought you'd like it. Anything you need, gentlemen, let me know.
The United Nations. Madmen are on the streets, Paul. But I will take care of you.  Your cellar is well-stocked, right?
Satellites?
You said you had no whiskey.
Whiskey?
I'll be over.
Get in.
No.
I hope we all get to do many things. Can we go now?
I am on a list! What list?
If you do not help me, you will stay on that list.
You think they will believe you?
Politics is power, Paul. And money.
Business is good at the hotel?
I am always glad to see you Paul.
I need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey.
Their money is no good to them. Soon all the Ineysi will be dead.
Were not going outside the hotel grounds unless we have an armored car. That's the ground rules.
Oh my God!
Go! What the fuck sort of journalists are we, running from a war? I'm ashamed. Are you? Well, are ya'?
Thank God.
Gregoire, what are you doing here?
I saw the sign.
I would never do that.
No. But I make cards. Would you like me to make you two cards?
One thousand francs.
How do you know?
Of course.
Move? Where to?
What?
Connections? I have no connections, only favors. If I call to help Victor, a General will think "Paul Rusesabagina is a fool. He thinks my favors are so numerous and so insignificant as to waste them on everybody." Then my hard work is doubly squandered. I insult the General and I do not get to use my favor at all. Please leave these things to my good judgment.
Please. Let them stay 'til morning. The militia will not come here, they know you are a Hutu with influence.
Please go back, bring the children to us.
What about us?
Enough of this. We stay together. Let me rest, I will feel better then.
No, no.
We wait until 7:00. If he is not here with the twins he is not coming. We leave. That was your promise. Go help the children.
Paul! Then another voice.
What's wrong?
Paul Rusesabagina, Mr. Godefroid. The house manager. I met you on your last visit.
What's wrong?
You are with me, Zozo, don't worry.
How dead?
Sir, no one wants to work. They say the boss has left.
Sir, Gregoire has been taking beers.
When?
Can I help you?
You're the Doctor, sweetheart. 'Guess the atropine worked, then.
So what stopped her?
But they didn't see it happen, they still have doubts. What we need is another body, and Steven's bloody hands right next to it!
Okay: this may sound crazy, but --
Oh dear.
More to the point. Where's our host?
-- uh, excuse me, just one quick question? How long before this damn thing unseals itself?
A very, very scary game. But then look at the bright side: if there's only one of you still upright at dawn, you'll be leaving here with five million dollars in your pocket.
Donald W. Blackburn, M.D.
-- she's not dead! Just have to get her heart pumping aqain!
-- what was he doing here?
-- fuck you!
And I think that's case --
I lied. The House is alive and we're all gonna die.
Hell NO!! The House will kill ya!
Did it work?
Price didn't make the guest list... The house did. It wants vengeance.
Poor Mr. Price --
Up here --
Best of a nightmare.
-- not a chance -- there's too much weirdness down there I don't think even bullets are gonna stop.
-- that's the fact, bud --
Back where?
He's dead...?
-- was that??
I don't do groups.
Jesus!
Cheer up: before the night's through, I'm sure one of us'll get hacked to pieces by somebody or something.
I hope not.
I'm impressed: I don't think Evelyn's ever said those words to anything with genitalia.
You shouldn't be -- you were nearly just killed, sweetheart.  And now that our birthday girl is finally here, let the games begin!
Sure know it wasn't me. And if you say it wasn't you -- then who the hell did, Evelyn?
Question answered.
-- anything, sweetheart, you need only speak --
-- being utterly fucking useless, what else is new.
Absolutely. No cheap thrills. A genuine Journey To The Brink Of Madness.
And then what happens?
I can't remember at the moment.
You're forgetting my lovely wife; she's part of the same winner-take-all as the rest of you.
-- I wouldn't worry, Ms. Jenzen: the unexplainable will probably explain herself before too long. In the meantime, let's all relax, have a drink, the evening's young --
Good way to get your head blown off.
I think I'll do what I damn well please.
I never saw you --
Not just yet. Would any of you be interested in knowing exactly why I ended up here in the basement?
Don't think so. Stay the fuck back.
Evelyn, go stir your cauldron or something for a sec.
I was just sitting here -- it happened. I had nothing to do with it.
No idea. I didn't even know the damn thing still worked!
Well, then, how 'bout maybe we call someone?
The basement -- but, believe me, you don't want to go down there.
This? This is nothing. You've only been dealing with the House itself. You have no idea what you're tinkering with. Sooner or later, the darkness that is at the core will get out... One of you will release it... Not meaning to, of course... then...  ...Bye, bye, Miss American Pie...
Oh, dear.
Over here.
You say you saw some activity here?
What was her name?
It might have been her mother.
Suppose not.
I don't understand.
Well I bet you they're happy.
We'll have every leprechaun in Ireland here honey.
She's down...how do you mean honey?
Ok...
Go to your room!  Now!
What do you mean?  Mommy? You're scaring me!
I'm ok mommy.
Sure.  Did you see the others?
That's great, honey.
Don't be afraid!
Will, maybe we should have separate bedrooms for a while.
Or what she was worth.
Maybe Eliza wasn't so crazy after all.
Well what power lines, Will?  Where?  Maybe we should call someone about it.
Voodoo stick?  It's nothing like that Will.  You're just being cynical.
I'm sure this sounds crazy to you.
Are you ok?
No...  NO!
I could see if I detect the presence of something.
White meat will be fine...
I took pity on the poor woman. This house is too big for one person to live alone in...
How can I help you?
Thank you.
Good night.
So what does that have to do with Aubrey!  Where is she!
We'll be there.
And what would you do?
Not really.  Oh, wait a minute.
It was nailed to the cellar wall.
Joey ....  Look, you wanna ride?  I can go by your place.
You wanted a story.  You got it.  Turn on the TV now.  And then get your ass down here ...  ...
And what did you discover?
And why are you back?  Why are we here?
I don't know ...
Then tell me what to do.
The Box, Joey.  He wants the Box.
It's nothing to do with me.  I wasn't even with him.
Sorry.
I'm trying to quit.
Did you know him?
Wait a minute.  He was already ... wounded ... when you found him?
Guys.  Sometimes friends.  Mostly guys.
Yeah.  Happening, isn't it?
Then you shouldn't even be around it. You know, it's ...
No.  No, you don't understand.  We're not selling it.  It came from here.  We want ...
Fine.  Fine.  But can you tell us anything about it?
I don't know.  Maybe.
I'm JP Monroe, you stupid little bitch. Now get the fuck out of my life.
What!?  What are you talking about?  Why should I help you?
Not quite.
Really?
That's so good to hear, sweetheart.  It really is. You know, I .. are you alone?
Terri, listen.       Why don't you come here and kiss me?  I mean, it's probably ticking away in both our minds, right?  Is it going to happen?  Isn't it going to happen?  Let's get it out of the way.  See how we feel.  Then we can relax.  Talk.  You know.
I laughed, I cried.
Still do the puzzles, still know the running times of songs, and I'll bet you're still the best damn cat burg--
Ah, had the perfect amount of foam.  Just get me to the bar... It's the one good thing in my life that'll never change....
Yes, master-thief, I can see that. You said something about a plan...
5:32.  "Swinging on a Star."
"And though he's slippery, he still gets caught."
What am I doing here?  There are so many things I wanna do that aren't this.  Paint a lighthouse. Kiss a woman in Italy.
Morning edition.  Seems two thieves "attempted" to steal it last night, but thanks to three "courageous" guards, it will be ready for tonight.
Don't act like you've never committed a crime before, Hawkins?  I know, I made call, when Anna tracked me down I...
Don't worry, we'll get it...
It's Boston, Mr. Mayflower.
Last rites, sister?
As for our plan of action, anybody'd be insane to go in from the ground floor...
You're supposed to be dead!
No, your Eminence.  I think he's going to steal the Codex, as early as next week.
That's the best kind.  A wise woman once said "Polite conversation is rarely either."
Yeah.  The big E.
I betrayed a man.  A good man.  An innocent man.  A thief.
Oh, why couldn't I be the Cardinal in charge of catering.... If the Mayflowers get the three sections of Da Vinci's crystal and his instructions for the gold machine-- Aie-yi--Do we got anything?  What of Alex, Hawk's friend, where is his loyalty?
Excuse me, Milady.  I would have flown over and carried you up to a pink cloud, but I left my cape at the cleaners.
Delivers up to ten at night.  The Pope has an obsession with his Easter Seals.  It's actually not that an unusual set-up.  The secret passageway on the other hand....
I don't steal stuffed elephants from little girls.  And I buy my own clothes.  My life's a little boring...
You really went and did it.  With one day, not even a day, of planning, you did it.  Nobody does it better, Hudson.  You started the week stealing the Sforza and you ended it swiping the Codex.
And you, Dr. Cappucino, you're lucky I don't hit women, assuming you are a woman.  I'm not taking anything for granted anymore.
You know, the place where you gave the bad guys the Codex.... the Mayflower Museum.
You re not "some guy" anymore, Hudson.  Right now, you're the only guy.  Without your help, I....
Uh, yeah.  Guess I'm a wee bit nervous.  I'm sorry I could only score clergy passports.
Trust Leonardo....
Yeah, but what would happen if that little mirror came out of the crystal.
Hudson, I'm afraid I'm sticking with God.  But you're a close second, tough guy.  What is that smile?
Oh Lord.... the only reason I ask is that Hudson, uh, Mr. Hawk, Hawkins, had some "neat" things to say about Darwin, Minerva, and you. Basically that you're part of the same car pool.
Sure.  Face down.  Two endearing shots to the back of the head. That's your mark, man.  What did Little Eddie ever do to...
Like a "cat", one could say.
What job?
The only thing you can't do is get sex for free.  I know I was in prison for like basically the 80's, but, call me daffy, aren't you supposed to <u>stop</u> me from committing crimes.  You know, Book-em-Dano, Call-for-backup, Give-a-Hoot-Don't-Pollute.
Just browsing.  Don't touch me....
And to think I thought you were Evil Incarnate in pumps.
Too bad.
Why George, you big softie...
Yeah, right.  By the way, as long as I'm getting things off my chest, I'm the one who killed your little monkey.  Made it look like a Mafia hit.  Did it for fun. Ciao.
The Hudsucker Hoop!
Sure, sure, we'd all be millionaires. There's no point in looking back. At the time, Stilson thought dumping our position would panic the market, further depress the stock -- then we'd buy it all back, and more of course, once it got cheap --
But then I figured it out: they did it 'cause they figured young Norville for an imbecile. Like some othuh people ah know.
'Cause they's little pigglies! They's tryin' to inspire panic, make that stock git cheap so's they can snitch it all up fo' themselves! But Norville, he's got some tricks up his sleeve, he does...
Them po' young folks. Looks like Norville's in fo' the same kind o' heartache ol' Warin' had. But then, she never axed me 'bout dat...
I know they're gonna buy that stock --
But, Al, it's the bunk! Norville showed me his design for the whatsit the day I met him! Why Buzz couldn't have invented it -- look at the man -- he's an imbecile!
You've lost it, Aim. You've gone soft by the looks of it -- soft on the dummy from Dubuque --
No thank you. Seek and ye shall find, work and ye shall prosper -- these were the watch words of my education, the ethics of my tender years --
Of course -- I went to the Muncie, uh, Secretarial Polytechnic!
Exactly. And I bet she's ugly. Real ugly. Otherwise, why wouldn't they print her picture next to her byline?
Well, the Hindus say -- and the beatniks also -- that in the next life some of us will come back as ants. Some will be butterflies. Others will be elephants or creatures of the sea.
That's it. A great wheel that gives us each what we deserve...
We have to be realistic, Amy. You know things have slowed down a little here at Hudsucker --
Now, Aim --
Now, Aim --
Worked in a watch factory?
Norville!
I'm sure you do.
Forty-fourth floor, and it's very --
I --
Well, I --
I like to think so! It's this little idea I been working on!
Fired! You're fired! Is that plain enough for you, buster!
And don't call me buddy! Out of here! Out!
We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries! Get out of my office! Leave your uniform in the locker room!
Buzz... off! Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Aw, buddy, I don't care about that.
Yeah, go ahead. Might learn somethin'.
I don't care if you're president of the company! I need that voucher! Now!
Well, I'm a college graduate --
Sure, sure. And did your classmates there call you 'jerk' or...  ...'schmoe'?
But, sir! --
Get out of my sight.
Oh my God, sir!
-- So if you think it's appropriate, I'd like to bounce the idea off a few people at lunch --
Ya get the special?
She looks in her purse...
Maybe he's wise.
No, Bennie: Lumbago.
She is!
A puff-up, I call it.  But Miss Jessica always says "brioche."
Nonsense, child!  I know Wesley's been drinking too much lately.  I know a great deal more about what goes on at Fort Holland than you'd think.  I know all about you -- that you're a nice girl, competent and kind to Jessica.  The Fort needs a girl like you.  But now we've got to get you back there.  I'll walk you back and stay over night.  It'll be a nice change for me.
So -- he says I'm nice.  He's a nice boy, too, Miss Connell, a very nice boy.  But I'm worried about his drinking.
Use your influence with Paul.  Ask him to take that whiskey decanter off the dinner table.
Try it -- you may have more influence than you think.
You don't believe in it?
I don't mean believe, like believing in a religion.  I mean, do you believe it has power?  Do you think it could heal a sick person?
Wait. Don't draw any conclusions. Let me explain.
I asked you to let me explain. It's a long story.  And not an easy one --
A year's contract -- a trip with all expenses paid -- that's not so bad, you know.
That's rather nice, isn't it?
Yes -- on the boat.
I went to school in Buffalo.  Paul went to school in England.
I don't know.  He spoke to me last night on the boat. I liked him very much.
It'll wait.
It's my day off.
I'm a nurse.  I always watch people when they pour something.  I watched Ti-Joseph and it was exactly two ounces.
Did you hear what he sang?
One of these days he'll start on you, the way he did on her.  "You think life's beautiful, don't you, Jessica?  You think you're beautiful, don't you, Jessica?"  What he could do to that word "beautiful." That's Paul's great weapon -- words.  He uses them the way other men use their fists.
Of course, Wes.
Not to a nurse.  Sleep is a cure.
A woman crying?  No one's been crying here.
If I were as timid as you seem to think, Mr. Holland, I wouldn't have gone into the tower in the first place.
And charming?
Yes, he can.  But I've been wondering -- you know if you could leave the whisky decanter off the table --
Why did you come in here?
I love Fort Holland.
Because you wanted to give my wife back to me?  Why should that mean anything to you?
What I saw the other night, I didn't dare believe, Betsy --
No.  It's not just how I felt toward Jessica.  I've been cruel to even you.
I want you to be safe, Betsy.  I want to know you're away from this place -- home again, where nothing can harm you -- nothing and no one.
This is something else.  They're curious.  Curiosity and religious fervor make a strange and explosive mixture.
It's more than that, Doctor.  I've entered into their ceremonies - pretended to be possessed by their gods...
It is a hard decision to make -- but yours is only a technical responsibility...
Paul, we're not trying to blame Miss Connell.  It isn't a question of blame.  It's a question of what we are to do with Jessica.  The commissioner is very concerned.
No -- it's about Mrs. Holland.  A result of our discussion the other day, I'm afraid.
In view of all the circumstances, the commissioner has decided on a legal investigation.
To the asylum?
It doesn't matter what you call it. I can tell you right now Jessica isn't going!
Foolish?  Tell them how foolish it is, Paul -- tell them!
Yeah, see you bright and early Monday am.  Say, where's the wife?
And as usual no one believed me...
It's you Ben who needs to talk. I've had my say, and I'm waiting to hear back from you.
You want to go?
Well, it is a neighborhood tradition.
Oh. Sure, I -- Did you remember to pick up the cranberry sauce?
You know Elena, I've been thinking--
That shirt?
You go dry off now.
So what were you doing in the Williams' basement anyway?
See for yourself.
What do you mean?
I know, I know. I had no idea --
Well, I'm really pleased to hear a confession.
Thanks for the diagnosis, Ben. Thank you. So let's just go to this fiasco if that's what you want to do. Let's just go on in. I'd rather talk to anyone else but you.
The phone's out.
Well good. Just confirming. You'll be on the 3:50 Wednesday afternoon.
All right.
Yeah.
Uh, dad, you know I'm 16.
Sure dad.
Don't bullshit me around, Janey. Jesus Christ, I waited around for more than half an hour, in nothing but my boxer shorts, and -- and what's all that about? What the hell happened?
What?
I just can't believe you could be so --
What do you think we're doing, dad?
Who else would I be talking to? And take that thing off!
Yeah.
Oh for crying out loud Ben, you don't mean to tell me that your marriage is going down the drain now --
-- 73, and divorce is as easy as paying off a traffic ticket, and for crying out loud, Ben, be a man and just get it over with. I would have if I'd had the chance.
It was lovely!
My husband is probably passed out in the bathroom, or at least he wishes he were. I've been married to him for 17 years and I don't have any intention of going in there to get him... so what I'm proposing is that since your wife has gone off with a boy, and since you are standing here alone, I'm proposing that you and I do what makes sense. Stay warm. Pass some time. That's all.
What the hey. Let's go for a drive.
Well, we can talk about it.
Hi Wendy.
With Mikey?
Is it a big party? A big neighborhood party?
Thanks for eating it. I don't know why I even pretend I can cook.
It's not like we're too busy.
But not too ashamed.
Sometimes the shepherd needs the company of the sheep.
I hope you changed the water in that bong from last night.
I gotta get to English class.
See ya.
Um, Libbets Casey.
Moisture! Moisture!
Like into one of the other 20 or so bathrooms they've got in this place.
Pharmaceutical! You are a god.
Major.
Yeah, Paul, are you gonna get home okay?
You going to tell dad?
Yeah, well, you've been in love with like every other girl here, I was wondering when you'd get around to Libbets.
My diagnosis is messed in the head. A poor little rich girl -- I mean check out the jeans and fur look. And lend your ears to this brutality. Like her mom and step dad and her step-sisters are going to Switzerland to ski over Thanksgiving break -- and like they didn't invite her!
Who said so?
Yeah?
Yeah. When it freezes, I guess that means the molecules are not moving. So when you breathe, there's nothing in the air, you know, to breathe in to your body. The molecules have stopped. So it's clean.
Then why'd you come after me?
I dunno. I --
Huh?
Yeah. Yours?
Charles. Have you been keeping out of my shit? Have you refrained from entering the sacred precincts of my room?
Dad's like doing his Up With People routine, mom hasn't been saying much.
What time is it?
What are you doing at home on a Friday night?
I have to go to the bathroom.
Don't worry about them. They're at that party, getting drunk and falling all over each other and making jokes about McGovern and stuff.
That's all, for now.
Then change it.
About an hour ago.  Said he was more than happy to cooperate.
Worth pursuing?
Where is he?
We just gotta catch the bastard, right?
No fibers, skin flakes, hairs...
Has her books in it.
No.
I told her to come.
Mrs. Connell found this copy in the house.  It's signed.  Personally.
Yes.  Not that much at first.  But then she became more comfortable.  Started visiting me every week...
You know what about.
To do nothing.
But he's zeroing in on <i>me</i>.  On <i>us</i>. Everyone's talking about it.
Cut some kind of a deal.  I heard that's what Flynn's doing...
No.  He didn't say what his name was. Only that you were expecting him.
That's not what he thinks.
What kind of stuff?
The other guy?
Best friend?
What was?
What was it?
The phone call.  The knapsack.
I said you're going to get a phone call.
It was when I went to kiss her.  She started laughing.  I got angry.  After all I'd given her.  All I'd shared with her.  I just wanted to make her stop. That's all.
This an accident, Walter?
Procedure went out the window a long time ago.
Then there is nothing.
Then God does not exist...
Listen to me.
She is.
It's already begun. If you want to save her, send her away.
You said there were none.
Like moths around the candle of the age. Decadent, useless. They can't reflect anything. But you do. You reflect its broken heart.
I knew. I rescued you, didn't I? From the terrible dawn.
What a pair we are. We deserve each other, don't we?
Does it?
Yes. It killed them, unfortunately. But it keeps the blood warm.
Louis, put me in my coffin...
The way I learn everything. By watching you.
Hush, Claudia don't talk about such things. Show me your book.
Sit still. It's not finished -
And he found me with you. I ran, sickened at what I'd done. Then he cut his wrist and fed you from him. I tried to stop him, but you were a vampire then. And have been every night hereafter.
And suppose the one who made him knows nothing and the vampire who made him knows nothing, and it goes back, nothing proceeding from nothing, until there is nothing! And we must live with the knowledge that there is no knowledge.
I can't. Go away from me.
And you never cried -
The workmen must have a trunk - don't stop, cherie -
Still my beautiful child.
It was something hurries...and seldom savoured... something acute that was quickly lost. It was the pale shadow of killing.
Nonsense all right. But something tell me it's going to be the strangest nonsense we've ever seen.
Never.
Yes...
Then my luck would have changed.
And a beautiful house it is too. Yours is a good life, isn't it?
I want it!
How do you mean, start?
Kill me if you will, but I can't do this...
It can't be...
And if I don't?
Anything is possible. But just try it for a week. Come into New Orleans and let me show you some real sport!
Come the New Orleans then. There's an opera on tonight. A real french opera! We can dine in splendour!
Respect me a little then. I'm the only life you know.
I don't pretend to know.
I know. Let her alone.
In the old world, they called it the dark gift, Louis. And I gave it to you.
Oh God Lestat. I felt peace. I felt an end to the craving.
That's enough, cherie. Stop before the heart stops.
Don't try to speak... it's alright...
You know I love the dark. But there's no dark anymore.
We can't begin this way. Let me turn on the light.
You're not lying to me, are you?
The same. As you would say today... Bull shit.
But it has. There is no more to tell.
It's over, I'm telling you...
Yes...
Stupid. What were you thinkng?
Fish are all over the water...Come on, let us take a boat out.
That's why you'll come with Titus, mon.
What are you doing in my closet?
Would you relax? We've been dating three months. He ain't stalking your butt.
Ray, come on. I want us to be together.
No, I'm the King of the World.
I'll be givin' your fisherman some of that and see how he likes it.
Just kidding.
They never found the body.
Only he wasn't dead. He killed Barry and Helen last July Fourth.
Rio isn't the capital of Brazil. It was the wrong answer. Sorry, we lose.
What do we do?
You're okay. Thank god.
Why are you being like this?
Can't what?
Oh...it's not working right. You're home early.  Did I scare you?
Hey -- I didn't know you were here. It's okay.  We got the refrigerator in. Come see.
Tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of nature.
I told you.
It was in a church...it was so real. I mean, I could feel his breath on me.
I thought I was over the dreams for good. I really did. I hadn't had one for months.
Right. Planes get hit by lightning. They get hit by meteors. They hit other planes.
I scared you -- I crossed the line --
Rio, baby!
I'd hate for you to have to blow...your whistle.
We gotta get out of here. Now.
Are you crazy? We're not staying here on our own.
I said we start having fun. And that means now.
Yeah, a great weekend. Forget the weather!
We'll call you back with all the details...So what's your favorite radio station?
How much?
I'm not waiting...So give me the gun and keep the ring.
See, it's not a macho thing. It's about equilibrium in your inner ear. You could've used a patch, but it's too late now. Get used to it.  Some folks just can't sail.
So why are you still here?
Yeah, wait right here, it's the safest place.
What is up with that weirdo?
You collect these to sell, abroad?
That staggering. His dying so quickly.  In your campaigns, have you never seen men who staggered before they died, who talked incoherently  walked blindly.
All the graves?
That was my companion. She sings little peasant songs quite nicely -- a completely untrained voice, of course.
M~ father will take care of it.  Pappa is wonderful! No matter what happens, he makes me feel perfectly safe.  I could never leave him. I should be utterly helpless by myself.
How could we go back to the wars with such pleasant company here..
I think not.
No one can take my father's place.
On my word! That's what they believe.
Poor Cathy --
They shall not hurt you
What an odd question!
Why, I love my father because - because I do. Of course, he's nice to me.
That should decide it or you --
How do you know what my father thought - -
Would you care to explain what you're talking about?
You wouldn't tell that 
Because he was a brave man - because I liked him -- I came here to be sure.
Never fear -- when you are dead you will remain dead. I will see to it that you do not walk about again. I promise you that. There is another one here who can not die. I will watch you both. Never fear.
Her family name?
I heard the same sound at Ladysmith, at Nukden, Port Arthur.  What do you expect after a battle?
We have no time for that.
Plague? There's no possibility of that, is there?
But the war, the army  they need you.
He hates all my race.
It is more than a feud between two families. He stole my mother away from her people.
Then why does he persecute me? My family told me what kind of man he is, how he stole my mother and then abandoned her --
All right  all right.
Bert! Thank heaven you're here!
Suicide.
I found it out a little late. I'm worth more dead than alive.
You've never been born. You don't exist. You haven't a care in the world.
You haven't got your wings. Yeah, that's right.
Yes, George?
If you know where she is, tell me where my wife is.
Where is she?
Well, naturally. Of course.
That's your problem, George Bailey.
Well, wait and see.
Yes, but George . . .
Well, what happened to you?
Give the flower a drink.
Hee-haw!
Nice girl, Mary.
Oh, stop that grunting.
Well, she's not crazy about him.
No.
Well, I've got eyes, haven't I? Why, she lights up like a firefly whenever you're around.
And besides, Sam Wainwright's away in New York, and you're here in Bedford Falls.
Uh-huh.
Yes, sir.
No, sir.
Ummmm . . .
Don't hurt my ear again!
Aw, forget it.
Hope you enjoy it.
Okay.  What's yours?
I'm going to miss you, too, Pop. What's the matter? You look tired.
Pretty much. You know, George, wish we could send Harry to college with you. Your mother and I talked it over half the night.
Come on, George, let's hurry.
Harry . . . Harry . . .
She was here first.
Hello, Violet. Hey, you look good. That's some dress you got on there.
Why, of course you can. Come on in the office here.
George . . .
I just did, but they said you left. This is a pickle, George, this is a pickle.
How does anything like this ever start? All I know is the bank called our loan.
Have you put any real pressure on those people of yours to pay those mortgages?
The envious ones say that, George, the suckers. Now, I have stated my side very frankly. Now, let's look at your side. Young man, twenty-seven, twenty-eight . . . married, making, say . . . forty a week.
Well, what about the Building and Loan?
I'd like to do that.
Have you notified the police?
What is it  a woman, then? You know, it's all over town that you've been giving money to Violet Bick.
I guess I'm not quite the football type. You . . . look wonderful. You know, if it wasn't me talking I'd say you were the prettiest girl in town.
Oh, no. Just right. Your age fits you. Yes, sir, you look a little older without your clothes on.
Oh, no, don't. I love that old house.
In that place?
Come on, tell me.
What is it you want, Mary? What do you want? You want the moon? Just say . . .
I'm going to scream!
Have you made up your mind?
Do you like it?
Would you rather leave?
Hi.
You have no idea what's happened to me.
So's mine.
Sean!  Listen!  Listen to me, Sean.
I think we're changing course a little.
Stop paddling!
Is she responsible for the punch?
I was counting on hours.
We're hung up on something.
There's a shark....
Gangway, Turkies!
Want to swim home?
The rope!  The rope!
N-o-o-o-o-o-o....
Happy to do it.
I just made it up.  It means, "Get me out of there."  What the hell's that?
Could you just keep that crowd back, please?
Not the drugstore!
About an hour, maybe two.  Let's see -- I came on about eight....
Every day?
Oh, c'mon.
You stay right here.  You're going in with me.
I kind of had plans....
Hey, come on....
Pop.  I'm sorry.
Did you get any pictures?
Come on, Phil, don't jerk me around.
Too late, it's written.
Will you listen to this man? Will you just listen to him?  You really caused a panic on a public beach, you shoot up the place, God knows who could've been injured -- what if somebody de- cides to sue us?  That could ruin us.
What's that supposed to mean?
Come on, let's check the bite radius.
The Shark's mouth.
Jesus, don't quibble with me.  I want to know if a Great White Shark did this.
That's it?  Probably?  Look, sharks are attracted by blood, and thrashing around....
MMMmmmorning....
What're you guys doing today?
Boat nut.  What is it about this place that makes everyone a freak for boating?
For me?
Oh.  Want to talk about it?
It was bad, wasn't it.
Turn in the car.  Clean my desk, explain things to our sons, then maybe get shit-faced and punch your boss.
Very impressive ceremony.  Good speech.
Of course.  Look -- I've got some missing persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator....
Two of them are still missing!
Maybe they are!
Bullshit?  I'll give you bullshit -- there's a dead whale out there with bites all over it!
What?
What the hell does it take to make sense to you numbskulls?  Jesus, it's right there in front of you. I know what a goddamn shark looks like, I've been through it, don't you understand?  I've seen this sonofabitch before!
Last transmission said ten juve- niles.
Then nothing.  If you see him, tell him to switch to an operational frequency, or give me a status report yourself.
That's what he said.
What's daddy doing?
Dad!  Dad!
I will, I will.
Maybe.
Sure.  They like to play.  We may see some today.
Nope.
You're crazy.  She's Ed's girl friend.
None at all.  I wonder what the Brebner twins are doing tomorrow night.
3:30.
Shut up.
Huh?
Nope.
Power line.
I'll be right there.  Wait up.
Maybe you and Brooke could come over to the town beach....
I love it.
If we beat them, they can both go home stag!  Single-O!  Alone! Jackie can come back in this boat!
Uh.  Well.  Maybe you could give Polo a hand going in....
You going with Patrick?
You always go with Andy.
Yeah.  Go on, beat it.
Brody's riding his tower.
What the hell is he doing?
I have to walk him till the drug wears off.
Get the hose!  We've got to force more water through the gills and oxygenate him!
I can get it.
With those camera lights and...
I know, but you're just going to have to find another way.  So you better start.
They're acting very strange suddenly.
Don't forget you have your brother.
Don't let him get you.  Just continue your patterns and pretend he's not around.
We play hide and seek all the time.  They find a lot of things.
No.
Hi, baby.
Oh, yeah.  Very.
Up.
Get your reserve bottle and let's go.
God, they're horrible.  I hate them.  Did you see its eyes?  How black they are?  The look in them?
I got it on sale.  A real steel.
Should protect you a little, from the compression.  If that thing gets ahold of you.
Yes?
No.
Sounds wonderful.
Me, too.
So tell Calvin.
Well, that's why you got it.
Hydrophobia...
It was removed from Charlie Overman's body.
Couple of fractures, lacerations. They say he's gonna be all right.
... Okay.
Who's going to do it?
I want that shark, Kathryn.
Yes, aren't we all.
I thought they were clever.
No, no.  That won't do.
Sharks are man-biters, Mister Hutton.  Not man-eaters --
I think we can capture it.  I'd like to try.
The only Great White in captivity, Calvin.  All those people standing in line...
We're taking that shark alive!
Thanks for helping.
... Massachussettans aren't.
Depends on big brother.
Are you really?
Come on!  Check this out!
Now what's this do?
What, hon?
Taking my boyfriend to the airport.
Ohhhhh shhhhiiiit.
What the hell's there?
Polar bears in Georgia???
I'm sure you won't.  But you're going to have to wait till we come up.  Then you can film all you want.
Always do.
Right, Mike.
Damn!  You sonuvabitch!  Look at you!
... I'll go to McDonalds.
It's not that easy.  Worked construction every summer to get through school.  Three years apprentice in the park's engineering department, and two years to build all this.  Finish school first, Sean.  Then make up your mind.  If you still want to work with me, we'll have plenty of time.
This company's expanding.  They got parks in Texas, Ohio, California.  I think I'm gonna be going to Waco.
We're in love.
No, really.  I've never met anyone like her before.  This is it.
Sometimes my father puts me in his lap and lets me steer the Jeep.
No way....
It sure is....
My brain is shrinking.  There's only so much room.
No....
I'm sorry.  Please, Carla.  I didn't think there was any danger.  I'm sorry. I love you.  Both of you.
You caught me....
It's beginning....
You have something to say about everything....
What difference does it make?  It's here....
What's going on?
Where's the lady who brings the soda?
Thank you....
You're silly....
It's not nice to be evasive.
I didn't.
Good night, Daddy....
Come on, Mom, you can't be serious....
I won't have anyone in my family any- where near the water....  Never again...Never....
It's Jake's actually...Our floating lab....
You just got here....
I'm the captain of this majestic ship.  It goes where I take it....
Mostly it feels like driving.  You digging for buried treasure?
Where do I pull off...?
Sharks come and go, Ellen.  People don't have anything to do with it....
Give it up... Kick it in the ass... Get on with your life....
Good.  I have two left....
I have my own little island.
I'm sorry...I....
Yes you can....
I have coffee in the thermos.
I do....
You're the man who drives the plane.
Yes I can....
We'll buy you one.  We're having a party....
A shark attacked Thea and some kids...She's going after it....
She said it was coming....
Good news travels fast....
Still chasing fish?
Inch by inch....
She's a tough lady....
She's had a lot to deal with...She needs time....
The readings suck....
Shouldn't pick on that.  Sorry.  I'm sorry about your brother....
May your sex life be as busy as your shirt....
They put bombs on dolphins....
As long as he's been here....
Half the pilots down here fly drugs ...He's always going off....
Maybe the gear crapped out....
Close...I don't know...Just get the hell....
I'm going down, Jake....
I live to hear the sound...You all right?
Maybe he only likes white meat....
'Snuck up on me....'
You don't like my voice...?
I've got to get to her....
It'll work....
My equipment doesn't crap out....
I'm the one who wanted to study it....
Here it comes....
When he has a pillow over his head....
Yes.
What?
Oh no--
Oh, no. I wouldn't go ...
Old guy, offed himself with a knife. I can't find the knife.
"Welcome to Eureka."
I think you're here all day.
A professional, whining, con-person bitch with an ass the size of Africa ..
Since when did you drink diet soda?
Seven thirty-five .. Here, "Town Gets Top Cop." I was gonna pin it to your wall.
Watch my lips .. <u>Don't get into it</u> ..
Why don't you throw them all away, and smoke none?
Why don't you dump the "Fat Lady?"
I dunno .. I guess this is staff side of the building?
Forget it. They got stringent hyg- iene rules. He's long gone in lime.
Then give me that Zippo.
I need some security. I don't trust you anymore.
It's not your friend. It keeps you sucking. Remem- ber the old Bum's lungs?
He didn't shoot it, Ross. And no way by accident. There's a flash-burn. It was point-blank.
No God, Brother. If there was a God, asses wouldn't be at the perfect height for kicking.
I never knew about the sailor the- ory, Ross. He might have that one little thing I need in his files?
Just makes to so God damned mad ..
<u>I'm sick of this toy town shit</u>.
Screw Citrine. He can fire me.
I spose I'm drinking myself to sleep. It's Helena's Christmas songs .. they're really pretty ..
I'm going up to the institute.
I guess by the bed.
That, I couldn't tell you .. And don't worry about anya this crap, by the time you're back it's gone ..
I thought it was Taylor's case?
No, Sir.
Three or four.
Once.
I think he would have if he could have - been trying to get me up here long enough - I think he may have bribed the old guy to retire ..
What are you looking for?
Hey, c'mon, country boys, let's all line up and hear the expert.
I was hopin since we spoke that you might have remembered something that would give us an idea where she is?
I see .. Well, she's teaching an- other class at four .. I'd apprec- iate it if you don't detain her ..
No. Except he smoked. Like you.
No.
No problem. I'm not in a hurry.
Of course I would ..
It was probably the wind.
No.
I know, but you pick on the one time in my life I like not to remember. I was in the bad lands. Really not well. It's something that happens to a lota cops. We don't wanna talk about that.
.. sorry your father, mother sis- ter, whatever .. I couldn't take another day of it .. Come on, I'm gonna rob you of a cup of coffee ..
I know.
I know about alcohol, John.
I been told to take your car in, Sir.
I dunno, Sir. Brought you up a Chevy.
Yes, Sir.
C'mon, Chief, if it's sensitive, tell me .. I'm not taking notes ..
Even better.
She's a doll. But I wish he hadn't brought her out here.
I'm already walking. Where is it?
A derelict.
Ask him.
Ugh!
I think I was trying to sleep with you at the time.
Okay, this is working.
Everything's on the fucking run! Everything --
What was our deal when we first got together?  Brutal truth, remember?
"It's okay to eat fish, 'cause they Don't have any feelings...
"Something in the way.  Yeah."
Just be friendly and say "no comment."
Then you shouldn't have begged me to hire him.
Oh, tell the story.
Dorothy.  Ray.  A pleasure.
Sure. Yes. Medical, I don't know.
Give me your number.  I'll call tomorrow.  I'm just a little. I'm a little insane right now.  But it's going to be great.
He's asleep.  Watch out for that lamp.
And I am...
Sure.
Happy. He said "happy?"
You don't have to explain.
Yeah, what happened there.
I'm relieved you said that.
Maybe love shouldn't be such hard work. I know, but --
Same to you.
Easy, easy --
Fine, I just --
You want...
...my soul or something. _ 117.
Aw, shut up.  You had me at hello. _ 130.
Of course, medical! _ 42.
Of course I know --
Dotty -- this is not "guy.". This is a "syndrome."  It's called Early Midlife, About-To-Marry, Hanging Onto The-Bottom-Rung Dear- God-Don't-Let-Me-Be-Alone, I'll- Call-My-Newly Long-suffering- Assistant-Without Medical-For- Company Syndrome.  And if, knowing all that, you still allow him to come over, more power to you.
-- well, Rod, your agent passed me a note before the show. He says that your deal memo has been signed by the Arizona Cardinals. Four years for ten-point-two million dollars.  Playing in the state where you grew up.
Ten seconds, Rod.
It's either going to be Denver or San Diego trading up to take him.
Denver got very silent about a day ago.  San Diego's got a fever for Cush.  This stuff tends to happen the night before a draft.  People get crazy.  And San Diego, you should know, is crazy to the tune of seven years for thirty. Signing bonus of eight.  Million.
Okay.
Yeah.  And it might have even worked too.
Very much.
Well, boo-fucking-hoo.
No.
That's your word?
Rod, I'm not a rascist.  I'm telling you to be the best version of you, to get back to the guy who first started playing this game. Way back when you were a kid.  It wasn't just about the money, was it?
Forget it.  Forget it.
You're hanging by a very thin thread, dude.  And I dig that about you.
No.  A real man does not shoplift the "pooty" from a single mom.
No, I'm going to answer you.  You want an answer?  I'll give it to you.  Loyalty.  She was loyal.  Everything grew from there.
A year-and-a-half later, we were both in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl. Now I've always hit a wall at 18 months.  Every serious girlfriend lasts 18 months.  It's like --ka- boom.  The curse of 18 months.
Jerry.  You two will be together forever.
Marcee -- this is one of our agents. This is Bob Sugar, who needs to learn to knock.
I came here to let you go. _ 27.
I've got the clients.  I've got the juice.
Hi Ray.
Wait.  I want to tell you more about my dad.
Aw, the fucking thing... I mean, the zoo is closed.
We'll go to the zoo sometime. Okay? I think I might have some time on my hands.
A lot.  We got a big fax today... we need this commission, buddy.
I'm scared.  What is it?
That's why they cheer, you know. The white man sending the black man into battle...
I want to find them too, but we can't do a bit of good right now. For every scary thing we saw in the daylight, I'll bet there ten times more of 'em at night.  Am I right?
Think.
I loaned it to Nash. He must have had it on him when he...
We're not going anywhere, I promise.
I'm trying! That thing took him down this way!
But he didn't. And neither did you. And I'm glad about that.
Where is it?
They set a trap  They actually set a trap.
We'll be broke in four weeks.
It's a rapid prototyper. I feed in the scan data from the raptor skull, than the computer breaks it into thousands of slices which this thing prints, one layer on top of the other. It's the future of paleontology.
NO!
Sorry, Alan it's been six years.
Let me know if I can help, Alan. Youre bad about asking for help, but please ask me. Anything, anytime.
In Costa Rica?
Which one do you prefer?
Any weapons, radios?
Yeah.
Are you sure?
I want to be an astronaut.
Something must've scared them.
I guarantee it'll be worth your while.
There is. I own a place called Kirby Paint and Title Plus. We're out in the Westgate Shopping Center in Enid, Oklahoma. The "plus" is for bathroom fixtures, fireplaces accessories, patio furniture. Stuff like that.
It's no use, Dr. Grant. No use.
That cheap aftershave I send you every Christmas, you actually wear it.  I'm touched.  Sit down, sit down, what brings you to Mombassa?
Well, I'm a very well-funded old son of a bitch.  You go.
You broke that idiot's jaw for no reason other than your boredom.  Tell the truth, Roland.  Aren't you even interested in knowing this expedition's quarry?
It certainly does.
No.  I feel something.
Like if you shoot yourself in the foot?  Wouldn't matter.  You'd be dead  before you realized you'd accidentally pulled the trigger.
Because I didn't know!  I don't have the faintest idea what they're doing here.
Isla Nublar was just a showroom, Ian, something for the tourists, Site B was the factory floor.  We built it first, on Isla Sorna, eight-some miles from Nublar.
Is that who we're really working for?!  Gene splicers?!
Dr. Malcolm -- the world -- owes you an apology.
I don't even know this woman.
I'm your daughter all the time, you know.  Not just when it's convenient.
No.  Richard talked to his parents.
Out of the question.  You'd miss the gymnastics trials.  You've been training for that for a year.
This is nothing like Austin.  Forget about it.
What?  Why?
I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep.  All the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves. I saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill.
Rex won't be any different.  It'll come.
Do me a favor.  Don't pretend for a second that you and I don't know the truth.  You can convince Time magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer of whatever you want, but I was there.
Don't start a legal argument with me, this island isn't your property, and neither are these animals!
Don't ask me.  The guy's completely out to lunch.
You're going too?
Dr. Juttson, please take Kelly back to camp right away.  Leave the other car for us and we'll meet you there in an hour or so.
What do you think they want?!
Where's Kelly?
It'll hold!
Look, we have two choices.  We can hike back down to the lagoon, where we can sit for two days, in the open, next to a heavily used water source while we're waiting for your boat to arrive, or we can head for the village, where we might find some shelter and we can call for help.
It'll still exit if they go on not knowing, won't it?
Now's the perfect time.  The animal just fed, so it won't stalk us for food.  Predators don't hurt when they're not hungry.
Lighten up, Ian, you sound like a high school vice-principal.
Are you insane?!
What?
Women.  'Bout eighty percent female in Greenpeace.
I'm trying!
Move where?  Our boat's not coming for two days, your airlift is waiting for an order you have no way to send --
What now?
Where did the vehicles stop?
How would we cut off the lysine?
Dodgson, Dodgson.  We got Dodgson here!  See, nobody cares.  Nice hat. What are you trying to look like, a secret agent?
I was wondering, how are you planning to beat the security?
The question is - - how much can you know about an extinct ecosystem, and therefore, how could you assume you can control it?  You have plants right here in this building, for example, that are poisonous.  You picked them because they look pretty, but these are aggressive living things that have no idea what century they're living in and will defend themselves.  Violently, if necessary.
We're - - still perfecting a viewing system.  The raptors seem to be a bit resistant to integration into a park setting.
Yes.  Good shape, too.  Five, six feet high.  I'm guessing nine feet long.  Look at the - -
Yeah, I know, you know...kids.  You want to have one of those?
They smell.
The Cretaceous.
Yeah, plenty.  Some of them can't walk!
Say again?
We were right!
Dilophosaurus.
Yes, unless they figured out how to open doors.
What's that?
You can't just stroll down the road, you know.
Okay.
I can see the shed from here!  We can make it if we run!
Dinosaur eats man.  Woman inherits the Earth.
Must go faster, it's getting closer - must go faster!
Hola, bienvenido
He sends his apologies.
I can't believe we invited Ian Malcolm.
And the concrete moats, and the motion sensor tracking systems.  Donald, dear boy, do try to relax and enjoy yourself.
Thank you.
Really?
What if the car falls?  What if the wheels fall?
I doubt it.
Could you guys possibly cool that for a - -
You got me.
Tim, you're gonna have to let go.  I'm going to count to three.
I didn't say I was scared.
What kind of opinions?
Wu?
Do they show intelligence?  With the brain cavity like theirs we assumed - -
Let's get you out.
I'm trying to use psychology to get you out of the drain, you know!
It's safe.
Okay.  Keep low.  Follow me.
Timmy, let go!  You're gonna have to let go!  Count to three.  I'll catch you.
There's no sign of him anywhere.
Thanks for the presents.
Why did you do this?
What?
That was great!
Ken, it's Bruce. Listen, we've got a nibble on the Pendleton financing.
You want to put in chain saws?
We're not talking about truth, we're talking about perception. And the perception is that Crystal Lake means inbred psychopaths running around the hills with axes and hockey masks chopping up teenagers.  That, my dear, is what we call an _image problem_.
Yeah?
You learn something new every day. Let's go.
I really think we should go back...
And we're in the center ring.  You sure you want to wear that blazer?
You're about to be a media darling -- you might want to dress the part.
What?
Shit. We're still putting the victim list together. You'll need a forklift for the case file. I suggest you hire some help, and don't expect to get a lot of sleep for the next few months.  You're about to defend the most notorious serial killer in American history.
Compared to this guy... amateur.
Who's chest?
I always throw that in. It makes the jury feel sorry for the defendant.
Wait a minute. Let me see that. She hands him the file.
Simple. We sedate him, induce a somnolesent state, and study his REM patterns when he's unconscious.  If he has the disorder, his REMS will be highly abnormal. Ruby smiles.
There's a pizza place over on Market.
He's my client, and this is important. Enjoy your waitresses.
Don't you see? Jason was _asleep_. And he was dreaming -- the REM patterns prove that. And I saw finger blades just like Krueger's come out of Jason's chest. There has to be a connection.
So what do we do?
It was Krueger, wasn't it?
Alone... but with a murderous fury inside him... which led him to kill dozens of people.
And if he's not?
About ten minutes.
My client... is dead.  But I think he's a free man.
No, no, no -- quite a long time, yes.
The formality of a trial would be too costly for them.  They're beginning to understand that it's the ensuing news of our actions that incites support.
-- In magazines nobody reads.
-- In what sense?
Naturally? -- that's not the word I would have chosen.
Success or nothing?
Yes.
Another one?
Not necessarily.  A <u>wife</u> would.
Burgel, I thought it would be easier, as long as I was passing --
Yes.
Say what you like -- no one pays the least attention.
... My ... social situation?
No -- I just -- I feel a sense of obligation.  He was my friend -- if I can be of any help -- closing his affairs.
I see -- it's just the Erlanger claim then.
I know.
Why would you suppose so?
Yes.
That he was -- satisfied in that regard.  I didn't want to pry.
Do you think people in the New Town care what happens over here?  This will always be the ghetto.
Burgel gave me this -- what does it mean?
First these nameless authorities were the root of all evil, now it's insignificant Burgel.  If indeed there was a mistake -- and a minor one at that -- you're suggesting someone went to a lot of trouble over something so trivial as to not matter at all.
Eight -- and seven months.
No.  He didn't seem to be.  Do you think he drowned himself?
I don't think he really had any. He had no family either.
That's not what I call conclusive evidence of an abduction.
We saw her naked once -- didn't we.
Is your friend's name among them?  Then he only worked on the one case.  Your Chief will send me the final summation when he's finished with it.
These laws have been with us for centuries -- how can you doubt them?
She went to the roof to sunbathe one lunch hour -- we watched her changing.
It doesn't matter.  It's too late for all of us.
Amerika for us!
Now Ann ...
I just wanna deal with the boss, ok?
Relax ... it was fifteen years ago. I don't do it now.
Jack! This is the archeological find of the century!
It' s alright Jack ... it' s alright.
We should never have come! I pay you good money, only to have my life endangered. You'll be hearing from my lawyer!
We offer ourselves at your service, Mr Denham!
Exotic lands, primitive people, dangerous animals ... That's what the public expect from a Carl Denham picture! Lead us into the mountains, Sir!
Yeah? ... Well, I gave 'em a taste of American lead ... and I don't see 'em coming back for seconds!
I can't get back to the wall! I'll get eaten!
Yeah.
Yeah.
Compassion.
And then one night -- at the gaming tables -- well I just saw him. A stranger -- looking at me -- and I knew suddenly that all my life I'd been --
You've spent your life avoiding this. You'll try hard to deny it; you're quite likely to destroy it.
Look -- could I use your phone?
Now there's a picture I'd like you to --
I guess he figured it was better.
From the beginning I don't know why the hell he's messin with you. If he was me he'd know better. If he was even a city boy he'd know better. You're a whore Miss Daniel, that's the truth of it, right? Now somethin I'd like you to look at.
Here please.
I'm an investigator. I'd like to ask you some questions about Tom Grunemann.
No, I'm look --
What?  What do you remember about that -- dumper?
Look -- I'm sorry -- I've led everybody wrong. I mean yes, I get those feelings, but that's just me, that's just feelings.  I'm sure this will amuse you; I'm scared of the dark. And sometimes I get shook up, I hear people or -- well, I'll come out in the morning and think someone's been prying at my mailbox, or there's a little -- trash outside my door and I wonder if someone left it there for -- do you see? -- things other people wouldn't even notice. Well that's not real, it's just nerves; it's got nothing to do with --
-- OK --
Tell me about Frank Ligourin.
No thanks.
Do you know where he got the dumper?
You said you wanted these.
Try some other ways.
When?
Frankie kept them in the same apartment: it cut his travel-time.
I don't get you.
I told you before, you wouldn't understand.
No.
Mm.
What?
About what?
They don't scare me any more.
OK.
Can you use these?
Yeah. It wasn't Tom.
It's not so bad.
I've just got a few --
Can you account for his disappearance in any way?
Examine this letter please.  We recovered that from the shredder -- the plant disposal and incinerator system. Grunemann apparently typed it Friday, before he left, decided not to send it, tossed it away. We've already contacted the New York Police; they think they know the girl in question.
Unknown, unidentified and unwanted. And there's more every day man, there's more everyday.
Yeah.
Unless he was involved with Grunemann's disappearance.
Nobody's seen that.
Not particularly.
Do you like to be with your mommy?
Greatest...
Show...
Soon.  Very soon.
That's right.  You're absolutely right...It's been a long time since I made French toast.
Billy, don't eat with your fingers.
I guess...
Uh huh...
That's terrific.  That's really terrific, but I notice I'm the one that's cleaning up this--  Oh, crap, I'll have to do this one over.
No.  This is fine.  Just take a bite, you'll like it fine.
Some of the brown stuff is still there.
No.
I don't care.  I hate it.  I want pizza.
No!
You mean for good?
Dad?
Sure.
Sure.  Lots of times.
Uh huh...
Uh, huh?
No, son, I didn't get fired.  I'll tell you what we'll do, okay?  How about if we go to a Burger King and then we watch a little T.V. and then we get packed to go to the country tomorrow. Just you and me...How 'bout that?
Who will read me my stories?
Sustained.
Yes.  Very much.
Your honor, I would request a direct answer to a direct question.  Does she have a lover?
Your honor, I'd like to ask what this model of stability and respectability has ever succeeded at?  Mrs. Kramer, were you a failure at the longest, most important personal relationship in your life?
Eight, almost nine years.
Yes...
Call up the people at J. Walter Thompson.  Set up an appointment at four.
Either you call and set up the appointment, or I'll call.  And if I call, you lose the commission.
No.
Okay, okay...What is it this time? What did I do now?...
Joanna, whatever it is, believe me, I'm sorry.
So we've got problems.  Everybody's got problems--that's normal--
I heard you, Joanna.  I promise I heard you.
Okay, I understand and I promise I won't try and stop you, but you can't just go...Look, come inside and talk...Just for a few minutes.
So do you.
You can't tell it from a distance, Ted.
You've been living here, in the city?
Ted, if you can't discuss this rationally--
Joanna, what the hell is--
No more waiting in Coffee Shops ...I promise.
I mean it Ted, you're running this one.
You want to know the real kicker?  The real kicker is, for the first time in my life-- the first time--I feel like a loser.
Me?  I've never been better. I mean having my wife walk out on me after seven years of marriage agrees with me just fine.
Yes, what?
Oh, for God's sake, Kramer. You have got to be the world's most naive human being.  Murray has gone in and changed every single ad you've done on the entire Fire and Ice campaign. Every layout...Every idea...Every single thing, right down the line.
Kramer, I'm sorry.  All I was trying to do was--
Right.
Tough...  ...I get off duty at five-thirty.  How long you been divorced?
You've got that look.  My lady and I split two years ago in August and I'm an old pro at this shit.  First thing, stay away from the Children's Zoo.  It's pure hell--if I never see another chicken, I'll be happy.  I'm here, darling.  Don't worry...
Fine.
First, there's no such thing as an open and shut case. Especially where custody is involved.  Got it?
Six.
Ordered, adjudged and decreed that the petitioner be awarded custody of the minor child, effective Monday the 23rd of January.  That the respondent pay for the maintenance and support of said child, four hundred dollars each month.  That the father shall have the following rights of visitation: every other weekend, one night each week to be mutually agreed upon and one half of the child's vacation period.  That's it.
We can appeal, but I can't guarantee anything.
It's beautiful.  It's just beautiful. They have a beautiful relationship.
Oh, Christ.. .John, there's some- thing I ought to tell you.  My... ah, situation has...changed.  I lost my job.
Look, Ted, all I--
OhmyGod.  Didn't she say anything? She must've said something.
Ted, don't be so hostile.
I mean...things.  Ted, Joanna's very unhappy and--
No.
I understand.
Uh, huh...She said she had a good job, was playing a lot of tennis.  She wanted to know all about Billy.
Sure.
Ted, I just heard...
A moment.
Yes. I am ready.
Khambas are wild men.
Again?
Cow.
I know.
It is alright, Father.
And you have horses? You love horses.
You have cracked a man's skull and that crack has not healed. It is too soon to expect him to be your friend.
I will not approve it.
Soon.
All?
Yes. Most of the Chamdo region is now in Chinese hands. There is a report from Chamdo which makes quite clear that, unless some settlement can soon be reached, Communist troops will soon be marching on Lhasa.
Yes, but they say he did.
If I were to go into exile, could we expect any serious assistance, from India, suppose?
Answer.
No. Not very big.
No. This war is almost over.
Ask whatever you will.
I shall send a letter to America, to the President, informing him of our problem.
Eight thousand, five hundred, soldiers and officers. We have recently requested mortars, anti-aircraft guns and ammunition from India. We have several hundred in the area.
The radio contact said one officer had died. Then he said, "The Chinese soldiers -- they are coming." And then, the radio went dead.
Shall we consult the protective deities, Holiness?
The Communists put their guns in the hands of the Khamba children and force the child to kill the parent. They have dropped bombs on the monastery of Lithang in Kham. It has been destroyed. Women and children, trying to escape from the fighting, have been shot with machine guns, fired from airplanes.
Good. Very good. Tibet is a great country. A wonderful history. Long ago, you even conquered part of China. But now you have fallen behind and we want to help you. In twenty years time you could be ahead of us. Then it will be your turn to help China.
For me, I think such a mix is crucial.
You have a lot to learn about organization. How to draw out people's opinions. How to make key decisions. Train your young Tibetans. When I make contact with you, I want to reach you through a Tibetan.
You will always!
True.
But you are not a shepherd, you are the Dalai Lama.
Reting Rinpoche has been arrested. He tried to overthrow Regent Taktra. Today, he is brought back to Lhasa by government officials. The monks at Sera Monastery have been on his side. Now, there is trouble between them and the army.
I will miss you.
We have.
Eliminate you.
Buddha teaches that we must learn from our enemy. We have compassion for all people.
It is a difficult situation.
Doubt is an affliction. Reliquish it. Accept.
The land has stayed in the family. We work together. The nobleman is not too bad.
Look for a strong woman, not too occupied with her beauty. Look for a woman who keeps her hands busy. Look for a kind heart.
My department doesn't have any record of that, Mrs. Bickerman.
Thank you.
It happens when I land.
<u>No</u>.  If you don't kill him instantly, I'm dead and you'll only kill him instantly if you get his brain, which is about the size of a cherry.  And even if you <u>were</u> on target, a bullet might not penetrate his hide.
If he's eaten in the area, he shouldn't be far away.  Crocs hang around the food source.
They come on land and they're brazen.  They're also attracted to noise, you can see I make a lot of it.
No!!  Out!
Deep down, gut check.  I'm growing fond of <u>you</u> and it's liberating to say so.
I coulda shot you, you--
I have no interest in ever looking at you, Hector.  Could you please cut me down?
Is everything a big fucking joke to you?
It came from across the lake.
I don't know!
Jack.  We've all seen it.  He's probably a hundred and fifty years old, he's bigger than an elephant.
That's actually the easy part.
Right.
You talk to Bickerman?
'Cept he wasn't before, was he?  You know, when friends or family members say things, they tend not to register so sometimes it helps to hear it from a total stranger. You're fat.
What?  Oh as <u>if</u> I'm interested.
They could try to tranq him on land.
Guess I finally got bit.
What?
Skipping stones.  Look how flat that water is, you can get ten skips on a good one.
I am <u>not</u> staying on shore.
I didn't fly up here to roast marshmallows--
I'm sorry but you're...
That's probably good.
A man just died, you're hitting on me with science.
But why <u>Maine</u> and why alone?  Crocs are social, why's this guy on the move by himself?
Maybe.  I've always <u>read</u> about what's happened.  I've never... I know it sounds silly but, it's nice to be someplace <u>while</u> something is actually... y'know... happening.
Ssssh!
<u>No</u>.  I keep getting hit with heads!
You calm down!
He <u>has</u> been going after everything. It <u>could</u> work.  But this is not a happy cow.
Take him.
So I was thinking... maybe if I met anybody in <u>my</u> world who was good for <u>you</u> and if you know somebody in New York good for me, we could fix each other up.
Good thinking.
Ready.  A museum in New York sent us some additional back up.
Alright, Ms. Paleontologist.  I wanna know why that monster is here.  You got a theory?
So does he.
You too.
Did he say anything?
I'm fine, thank you.
It's to make you <u>understand</u> him, with understanding comes tolerance. Too bad they don't put proverbs in Twinkies, my load would be lighter.
I asked you to be nice to him.
And that's why he thinks they're Godly?
I'm just curious.  I can never tell what women think is handsome.  Is he handsome?
I don't know.  It was like a tug. Something tugged us.
He said he knew Karate!
Kevin, hey.
Absolutely.
I know and I thought I could handle it but work and pleasure along with somebody else, it's a dangerous mix.
Else.
I'm sure it's nothing, but you're a paleontologist, this is what we do, I--
It has nothing to do with--
Well... he didn't have to tell me that part.
Pleading with a crazy man, with come all over my face.
The one that was weighted down. Where is she...? Fred something.
Agent Mapp! Thank you!
I don't know! Get me out!!
I see.  Let's make this quick, then. I'm busy.
You might have suggested that in my office, and saved me the time.
I need the ID to fly with my gun. The gun belongs in Quantico.
Might I suggest tucking your pants into your socks? To prevent mouse intrusion.
Oh my! Oh my... Maybe you better come out now, Miss Starling.
I hope so. They haven't posted anything.
And what is that, sir?
It's all there, sir, practically verbatim.
You haven't said a word today about that garage. Or what I found there.
It matters, Mr. Crawford... Other cops know who you are. They look at you to see how to act... It matters.
Then have the lab check Raspail's head.  Dr. Lecter's patient - have them probe his soft-palette tissues... They'll find another cocoon.
I'm 53, Starling. If I found Jimmy Hoffa on national TV, I'd still have to retire in two years. It's not a consideration. But you are...  You've done enough. If I keep you out of school any longer, you'll be recycled. Cost you six months, at least. I can guarantee you readmission here, but that's about it.  Now's your chance, Starling. Go back to class. Leave Bill to me.
You heard them. I don't have that authority anymore.
Starling, we know who he is! And where he is. We're on our way now.
Sewing...
Chicago's only about 400 miles from here. I could be there in -
I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.
Stacy, did Fredrica ever mention a man named Jamie Gumb? Or John Grant?  Do you think she could've had a friend you didn't know about?
Where does Mrs. Lippman live? I'd like to talk to her.
Sometimes you do.
"We" being the Behavioral Science Unit, at Quantico. You're one of Jack Crawford's, I expect.
Yes.
No. I only hoped that your knowledge -
Then please - do this test for me.
If you didn't kill him, then who did?
Scared, at first. Then - exhilarated.
I don't know. Next time I'll have to check.
I never thought about it.
That doesn't interest me, Doctor. And it's the sort of thing Miggs would ask.
Mmm. And what else...?
Tell me. Don't lie, or I'll know.
The significance of the moth is change. Caterpillar into cocoon into beauty... Billy wants to change, too, Clarice. But there's the problem of his size, you see. Even if he were a woman, he'd have to be a big one...
Why so briefly?
The personality inventories would trip him up. Rorschach, Wechsler, House-Tree-Person... He wouldn't test like a real transsexual.
First principles, Clarice. Simplicity. Read Marcus Aurelius. Of each particular thing, ask: What is it, in itself, what is its nature...? What does he do, this man you seek?
No! That's incidental.
No. We just -
And - one morning I just - ran away...
What was it?
Got dressed without turning on the light. I went downstairs... outside...
No. First I tried to free them... I opened the gate of their pen - but they wouldn't run. They just stood there, confused. They wouldn't run...
Tell me his name, Dr. Lecter.
Thank you, Doctor. I'll keep it in mind.
I won't sleep tonight. What an adventure!  I absolutely cannot wait to return to Portman Square, having laid eyes upon the full-blooded, red men in the wild!
Why did they turn back?
How did you learn English?
And what were the consequentialities of European culture you didn't bother with?
Miss.  May I?
No. I will find you.
...never doubt what you are doing.
He knew the consequences. And he stayed.  Are those the actions of a criminal?  ...Duncan, do something.
Yes I do! I know exactly what I am saying.  And if it is sedition, then I am guilty of sedition, too!
Aversion?  No... "Hatred"... "Loathing"...
"Some"?
Cora, in my heart, I know once we're joined, we'll be the happiest couple in England. Let those whom you trust, your father, help settle what's best for you. In view of your indecision, why not rely on their advice and judgment as well as mine?
Yes. Yes, I will.
What the bloody hell plan is this?
Do you hear me, sir!  If you ever fall... into British hands...  What white water?
Then we take the south rim down the mountain and it's 12 miles cross country to Fort Edward.
Out the northern sally-port. Strike for the east side of the swamp until you clear the French picket line. Head north over the ridge, then come about southeast and fork left in Little Meadow and you're free of the outpost and skirmishers...
That reason wear a blue dress and work in the surgery?
...not enough time to get to Albany and back with reinforcements...
What did you see, Major?
And what is that?
Only twelve miles away! He could be here day after tomorrow.  Find your man, sir! Captain Beams will give you the message.
Sir!
"Magua understand paleface is a dog to his women.  When his women want to eat, he lay aside his tomahawk to feed their laziness."
Does Yengeese Major have property across salt sea?
Yengeese Major give all property to Magua.  Magua give Yengeese Major much wampum, many gifts, maybe three, four oxen.
And this?
Does the chief of the Canadas believe the English will keep the terms?
Many things my French father cannot do, Magua can.
Carry them to England to your King with pride.
France.
Il est necessaire d'etre vigilant, mon enfant.
Well, I'll be on the golf course in the morning.  Then, if I don't have any babies to deliver--
He did.
I'm not a doctor.
I don't know.  I've been back and forth with Narragansett Naval all day, consulting with the best people in maritime medicine, the best people in viruses...
No.  I think they isolated him in genetic engineering. Homo aquaticus...
Don't worry, I don't want to give up any more.
Uh, oh...I see where this is going...
There's now a problem with the weather for pickup.  There's a typhoon in our sector... ...We're going to be delayed twelve hours...
What dead one on the ship?
I need electrical field experience on my resume. Everything helps...  Why are you here?
Has it helped?
Can't we fix it?
It bit me!
Don't thank me, yet, but it is important to know where you're going and who your friends are... 'Know what I mean?
What you don't understand is that my crew is in jeopardy.
It shouldn't be a long delay.
Not yet.
It wouldn't make any difference in there...He could be two feet away and on fire and she'd still not see him!
The man is unbelievable... I say, leave him in there.
Hook's on 24...
Shhhh...don't tell no one.  Job security.
What music?  There ain't no music.
Pretty good.  He sent them out videotaping outcrop.
I feel it, too...Someone's trying to get out.
I'm going to kill it!
What?  That?...I've done this one before.  You hungry?  I'm hungry.
We're simply concerned about her...proximity to...
It's had a meal.
No fuckin' lie...
The air's stopped.
Your pocket?
Right.
Probably no longer than four weeks.
I would rather put my money on a three-legged rocking horse. The odds are a hundred to one for a good reason, BACON . . . it won't win. So where is Ed with all the bright ideas?
It's hit us all hard!
I still will, if you don't mind.
Think about what you're going to say, Ed; we are on thin ice.
A cocktail, you asked for a cocktail.
You want a pint, go to the pub.
You ask him if you like, but I would leave him to it if I was you.
You get the guns?
There were two old guns there; where are they?
Yeah, Bazza, what?
Chris.  You come to collect something, Chris? Should I have something for you?
Er, yeah, sure, I'll have 'em.
Yeah, it's all there, to the pound.
It looks like ít, but who knows? The opportunity was there. In my experience it is best to take the opportunity if it is there.
No chance of you lifting this sunbed up is there?
That's no way to answer the phone.
You know those shotguns I sold ya, well I need 'em back.
We're in the spite. They were his fucking guns that we sold; we gotta find 'em.
What is the point in that? Even if it was a bug they would have taken it with 'em.
There is no such thing as easy in my experience and, if you think this is going to be easy, you're a dick. It may be easier than most but it's not going to be easy.
How about you? All right?
All right, all fucking right, I am coming.  Willie, he doesn't know you are here, just sort something out, OK.
I mean it, there is only three of us here.
Out the back.
Well that depends on how you look at it. I can afford it as long as I see it again, if that's what you mean. You got the rest from the fat man and Bacon?
Carrying them. They could all be carrying them for what we know.
Where did they get those outfits from? Haven't we got some like that, Tom?
Why not? The whole of the British Empire was built on cups of tea.
I don't know, but what I do know is that there's no more Harry, which means there's no more debt, and if there's no more debt there's no more problem, and there's no more problem with our neighbours because they are all dead. I think, if I get this right, we haven't done anything wrong anyway, which means we are in the clear.
The man who decides if you can play is this man Harry, or Hatchet Harry as some including himself like to call him.
Why, what's up?
Right as rain.
What do you mean, me?
I'11 meet you in the car.
We paid seven hundred quid for those guns. They could hardly trace them to you, could they?
I like your bar.
I want your bar.
All right, it's Plank. Is Willie there?
You know it doesn't include the amp.
Doesn't sound very good to me.
Never mind that now. I also need some artillery, you know, a couple of sawn-off shotguns.
I'll only be a minute.
At what, exactly?
Cupid stupid! That's the last time I am getting any more fruit off you Tom. Call that fresh? There was more small hairy armoured things in your fruit than there was fruit. You should open a butcher's, not a grocer's.
Hold on, give us half a chance to count it.
Six.
How the fuck should I know?
Er, fertilizer.
I don't pretend I came over on the Mayflower--
So?
They're not going to jail.
I'm sorry, sir.
I-I can do the job, sir.
Follow orders. Do whatever they say.
Yes, sir.
I'm sorry, Sergeant Major. There wasn't anything I could do. Shadow gets crazy--
He's going to lose a lung. This is not good news for Athena--
Thank you, Sergeant Major.
We were just dancing--
Hey, Ben. Thanks for coming down.
Male, 40 to 50 years old, five-foot- eleven, chewed tobacco--then we get into the dental records--
That badge--
Yeah.
Skull was intact, no soft tissue left--not much to go on.
Colt Peacemaker.
You feeling bad for Jimmy? Have him tell you the size of the mordida they took out of his hide when he run a place on the other side. Those old boys in Ciudad Leon--
You do whatever I say you do or else you put it on the trail, son.
You're fired. You're outta the department.
--and that squeaker the Aggies dropped to Oklahoma-sonofabitch stepped in some lucky shit before he kicked that goal--
Daddy calls it an "altercation." How you doing, Sam? You look skinny.
You watch the draft this year? 'Course you didn't, idiot question. They try to make it dramatic, like there's some big surprise who picks who in the first round? Only they been working it over with their experts and their computers for months. Doctor's reports, highlight reels, coaches' evaluations, psychological profiles--hell, I wouldn't be surprised if they collected stool samples on these boys, have 'em analyzed. All this stuff to pick a football player for your squad. Compared to that, what you know about the person you get married to don't amount to diddly, does it?
What?
Colonel. Is uhm--is Otis in?
If it's too late--
Your mother got a brother--Alphonse--
No sir.
So they stayed in Florida?
Are you kidding? And face a court- martial?
Public Display of Affection. Every time he moves up a rank, it's like he's got to tighten the screws a little more--
I thought we already had this out? Next year, if your grades are high enough--
You got to be in the Army, you might as well have something slick to drive.
Lead mine.
It's not just cactus.  There's the nopals, the yuccas--
Man knows a hundred-fifty varieties of beer, he can't tell a poinsettia from a prickly pear.
He can't hear with that rig on-- Mikey!
Yeah?
Well--I don't see what's changed. No - PDA's, no necking on the obstacle course.
Good deal you were born down here, then.
You mixed drinks bad as you mix metaphors, you be out of a job.
Old Sam stood for somethin', you know? The day that man died they broke the goddamn mold.
So tell me why I shouldn't make this place off-limits.
I hear things, too.  People call you the Mayor of Darktown.
Why would you want to do that?
I heard somebody been haulin' wets on this road.
You know this road got a bad reputation, Eladio--
Good night, Enrique. She slides into the car--
I have some friends who have had a accident--
You think you're doing these people a favor? What are they going to do? Either they get on welfare or they become criminals--
I am marry to the cousin of a friend-- but only to be able to live here. This is the mother of my child--
We have a daughter.
Better late than never. Korean War hero, Sheriff for near thirty years-- Buddy Deeds Memorial P--
We don't need a new jail.
We're already renting cells to the Feds for their overflow--
Right.
You go by your old house?
You recall if Charley Wade was a Mason?
We got that dedication tomorrow. This is a hell of a time to be draggin' up old business.
Sam! Quite a do the other day. It meant a lot to folks that you said something.
Buddy Deeds--
Word gets out who that body was, people are gonna think Buddy done it.
Danny's gonna be out for blood the next time.
It wouldn't happen to be your construction company gonna get the bid on building this thing, would it, H.L. And Jorge, you wouldn't be thinking about a couple dozen new jobs to dangle in front of the voters--
The Sheriff.
He was killed.
A little older than Paloma is now.
I was too busy.
Them days, you deal with Sheriff Wade or you didn't deal at all. First of the month, every month, he remind you of who you really workin' for.
He's going to wish he was dead.
He ever accept cash for a favor?
Of course you can.
Enough with the clothes--
Out in the fresh air, nice gringo lady making you pies--who's gonna sit back in a little jail cell all day? Sheriff Buddy, man. Como el no hay dos. And after that cabron Charley Wade--
He murdered Eladio Cruz. That tough enough for you?
Somebody called--something about an electronics store.
You've got your mother, your kids--
What was your father's name?
You'd do a good job.
I appreciate you telling me.
I haven't seen anybody come by.
Yeah. It's quiet--
Sure.
Uh-huh.
He's gonna find out.
I mean, there's no instructions--  What do you mean, they're not tricks?
He's a priest?
About?
Not yet.
I swear... this is the place Swann told me about.  The rocks...
Yes...
Please... Butterfield... I wasn't there.  Ask Pimm.
Yes.
You don't?
I don't exactly know. Philip doesn't like to talk about the past.
Sure.
You haven't seen anything yet.
I don't know where you'd start.
They won't tell you anything.
Jennifer Desiderio, for one.  She threw herself in front of a car this afternoon.
I was grateful to him.  I owed him my life.  And he loved me. He couldn't always show it, but he felt it.
And they all came...
Find Valentin!  Find him!  Get him in here!
I'm here, Harry.
I... have... to.
Harry-?
I'm a private detective.  I was hired to follow somebody for a few days.  A guy called Tapert. Insurance fraud.
Evil.  He was evil.  Come on.
Illusions are trickery. Magicians do it for real.
Yes.  It's regrettable
What for?  You need to stay busy?
Why people die?  Give it up, D'Amour.  Go home.
I'm afraid she's not in.
Haven't you seen enough to know that doesn't matter?
Shit...
Shut up.  We've lost enough lives already.
And what does Jennifer think's real?
I'm not afraid to die.  There's something terrible... coming home...
I know all the kids coming up. Got to stay ahead of the game. But I don't know you.
It's not a business. Harry. It's a vocation.
Now I'm going to have to kill you.
Why?  So you can fuck my wife?
Now that I'm dead, the spotlight's off her.
Yes.
Looks that way.
No.  I'm taking a couple of weeks' vacation.
What?
Fuck you.
You want to be like that, Swann? Mud and shit?
These people are paying you a lot, do you think you could consider it?
Thanks. I'm sure your mid-life crisis will work out,too.
Who do I have to fuck to get off this planet?
No.
I think he kind of liked me...Is that so hard to imagine?
I don't know. My fax said "have a good fright".
But, it's great being with them, after they can talk, and can do things with you.
Where'd you grow up?
John thinks I'm so snotty.
I know, but that's what you like about me.
No, we'll find something around here.
Hi, Bob.
Yes.
Hello, darling.
Oh, yeah? I wish I had seen it.
That sounds great  can you hold on...  What Zoe?
Ok, well... I love you.
Is this a bad time?
What are you talking about?
What?
Alright?
I have to go, Adam's tormenting Zoe, I'll talk to you later. Are you going to be Ok?
It's Lydia, your wife.
Tomorrow.
Ok.
Do you want I send it to your room?
Why do you have to defend her?
Ok. Maybe I'll walk down with you.
What?
Oh... that's nothing, someone gave it to me.
I'm not. It's just corny, but I'm not into it.
Ok, definitely call them, I'll be back Friday. I love you.
It'll just be a few days.
Bad?
Sorry.  It's just...a strange woman waltzes into my office today.  Tells me she murdered her parents and can prove Satan exists.
I don't know.  What are they?
Frustrating.  Form over content. Everything's so retro.
What time did you make it for?
On the day of the murders  what did the defendant request?
I'm gonna go make a stink.  Sit tight. I'll make sure you get a change of clothes.
And was he in distress when you opened the door?  Or was he sitting here, relaxed, at this table?
You weren't there.  Give me time to get some proof.
If you really believe in God, why is it so inconceivable that his enemy is just as real?
Father, I have nowhere else to stay.
I don't have the experience.  Father Thomas should officiate.
You ready?
You know, I respect that you have such faith, James.  I don't understand it, but I want you to know that despite our differences, I admire you and I always will.
Everything I did, I did for you.  I love you, Peter.  Think of it.  I'm giving you a gift, absolute power and knowledge.
Don't worry...about the transformation, Maya.
Um hm.  That's right, Maya.
How many weeks are you honey/
You need his blood-type.  Like right away.
Oh, thank you, thank you so much!
...as a narcissist, he couldn't blame himself.  He created the voices after the fact.
Peter Kelson?
Listen, I'm sorry, but I'm running late.
That's their explanation.  You might not believe me...
It's true.  Birdson knew your name, he was writing it in numerical code.  It wasn't easy but I figured it out.  It spelled your name.
The good outwitting the bad.  It's like Birdson had a split personality.
You're already contaminated.  It's why you couldn't hear the tape.  There's probably a pentacle near your bed.  To sanctify you.
If you or any of your lunatic friends ever come near me again...
The only baptism he ever performed in seven years as pastor at Bedford.
Seven years.  One baptism?  He's your mother's only brother
What?
Your 33rd birthday.  The transformation will be a perversion of Christ's rising from the dead.  Townsend discovered it in one of Lareaux's books.
What's the bible for?
We're going to do this.
Maybe that's my problem.
Only your body will remain.  I believe your soul will be at peace.  If we kill you, Satan can't stay.
So, what does it mean.  The ark sank and the sun set?
I know who he is.
You are the younger of two...
We millionaires yet?
Well, long-term exposure to things like this tends to give you a sort of clinical understanding of the subject. After awhile, you begin to make friends with it, so to speak.
No, the less mystifying.  Good and evil are only illusions.  There is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."  That suggests some third party bad guy pulling all the strings.
Mike.  Oh, the christening.  I meant to call...
Hey, don't thank me.  Somebody up there likes you.
Where is she now?
Fine, you don't like this one, which one would you rather wear?
Need any help?
To that stewardess?
Oh, yes.  The superstar female athlete whose mother is nothing but a housewife.
The doctor said it was okay.  Anyway, I'm still trying to lose some of this baby fat.
You're a caterer?
Thanks.
Uh-huh.
Get used to it, babe.
You're just scared.  I know rehab is hard, and you have to worry about whether you'll be as good as you were but you will be.  I believe in you.  You just have to get back on the court.  Like you'd get back on a horse.
Always on my ass, anyway.
Just cause I don't kiss her booty like you...
No one's forcing her.
Found?  I'm not some charity case.
Too many times.
I'll take that as a compliment.
No buts.  Took a lot of heart to take that charge.
But that was a dumb-ass pass to Toni. Ten seconds left, you run out the clock.
You mean my championship trophy?  My bad.
I guess, you know, we play ball and we ride to school together.  And if you get mad at me, I gotta give you flowers.
Oh.
So that means I have to ride with you.
Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give to you.
She's a ho cause she's sending her coochie through the mail.
Who's Spalding?
Yeah.
None of your business.
That what you think?
Cause I don't just stick my dick in anything.
You do see me standing here, right?
What?
Why not?
I mean, I can stay a few more minutes.
Quincy...
Here I am.
You think for once we could talk about something besides basketball?
Yeah, sorry about that.  I had this meeting with this guy.
What the hell's going on?
I never asked you to choose.
I was.  I see your peach fuzz finally grew in.
We won the championship.
Thanks.
Darryl.  He's alright, kinda corny.
Yeah.  Two weeks.  I didn't get to send you an invitation, but if you...
That a nice way of saying I rode the bench?
Something was just missing.
What?
What?
I know why you broke up with me in college.  And not that what you did wasn't messed up, but what I did was, too.  So if you forgive me, I'll forgive you.
C'mon, girl, you live next door.  Who's been creeping?
Nona, don't start bitching.  I got maybe two years left to play.  I'm just trying to put some things together for us.
No, you said I should get my degree.  I like my "bullshit" job, okay, and it's gonna lead to a spot in the front office. Til then, don't worry, there's just enough savings to keep your ass in Gucci and gold.
Nona, please.
Happy.  And he won't want to see you.
I've been hearing you.
Said he'd be home later.
Don't sweat it, okay.  Sooner or later the truth'll come out.
I mean, how many times have you told me yourself to watch out for these ho's?
Let's hope I can say the same about you one day.
You know, people.
I'm also good enough to go pro.
You came out early.
I mean, it's not true, is it?
We need to talk.
Look, I ain't saying it was right, but sometimes things happen.
Your mom was real quick to show you those pictures, wasn't she? Well, she was nineteen when she got pregnant and don't get me wrong, you're the best thing in my life, but she knew I wasn't ready for no marriage.
Fine, I'll fuck off, but not til I say something.
I don't know.
These adults are tough enough, I think you'll be surprised -- the Mexican's a bit of a question mark --
In my sleep, Burt.
You fuckin' don't do that. You don't do it, you cocksucker. I'll fuckin' kill you with my barehands.  Go. get the fuck fuck -- we're going back and we finish the show --
What's wrong?
Well what's the situation?
It's rough.  I'm sorry, did she make it?
It's a helluva disease.
No.  No.
I want to sit.  I want to talk to you.
I don't want you to think that I'm that way to you -- I'm not gonna call you a slut or something --
Don't yell, honey.  Please don't go crazy --
I have something, so much -- I'm sick, Claudia. I'm sick.
I'm dying, Claudia.  I have cancer. I have cancer and I'm dying, soon. It's metastasized in my bones and I --
LAPD. Open the door.
It's the LAPD, can you open the door, please?
No one else in there with you?
Ok. For one thing, we're gonna need to turn that music down so we can talk, ok?
Well if you keep listenin' to the music that loud you're not only gonna damage your ears but your neighbors ears.
Who was it?
You and your boyfriend have a party last night?
-- do you wanna cup?
That'd be fine.  So, Claudia, lemme just say, so I can get my role of LAPD officer out of the way before we enjoy our coffee  I'm not gonna write you up or anything, I'm not gonna give you a citation here -- but the real problem we have is that there are people around here, people that work from their homes, people tryin' to get some work done, and if you're listenin' to your music that loud:  They're incovenienced by that.  If you had a job you'd probably understand, but I see you like listenin' to your music and that's fine, you're just gonna wanna keep it down at a certain volume, maybe memorize what number you see on the dial and just always put it to that -- If it's the middle of the day -- that's what I do -- just put it on two and a half and that's a good listening level, alright? I see you like listenin' to your music loud, but, hey, forget about the neighbors, you end up damaging your own ears ok?
Arlight, then.  Cheers.
It's not -- what's a 422?
This is, for not a fresh cup, a great cup of coffee, Claudia --
Yes.  I will.  It was nice to meet you Officer Jim.
Then...I'd like to go...What do you want to do?
Really?
What about ten o'clock, is that too late?  I don't get off and then --
Oh, see?  This is great.  Ten o'clock.
What?
ok.
I'm really nervous that you're gonna hate me soon.  That you're gonna find stuff out about me and you're gonna hate me --
Ohhhh I started this, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, fuck.
yeah, yes, hi, hello.
Diet Coke.
Son, don't --
-- no.
Son, please, now....
I'm not mad, son, I will not be mad at you and it's ok and please put it down and I won't be mad and I won't --
I think it's more complicated than that little man.
Why the hell aren't you in school?
They don't have substitute teachers where you go to school?
That's confidential information, little man.
I ain't fuckin with you --
-- watch the mouth, homeboy, I don't need to hear that word --
Now that shit will help you SOLVE the case.
What's up?
Maybe I'm just happy to see my friend, Brad there.
Well --
I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.
"The" cause of dullness in others --
Mmm.Hmm.
Brad, honey, you have a special secret crush over here I think, don't take him too lovely -- he might get hurt --
"It's a dangerous thing to confuse chidlren with angels..."
Don't get strong, Donnie. This is making sense, this making a lot of sense. You are not doing the job, the job I ask you to do, a job I give you. Over and over and over and I'm sorry. But I'm not gonna say I'm sorry that much more.
It's...doesn't matter....
I can help you through this the best I know how but there are certain things you are gonna have to be strong about and take care of, now we can go over them, but I need to know that you're listening to me, ok?
We can fix that, because I can give you -- are you listening?
Fuckin' bullshit is what this is.
I'm trying.
She went out.  She said she went out to run some errands.  She'll be back.
When was the last time you talked to your son?
Is Jack your son?
Hi.  Is Frank there?
I'm looking for Frank Mackey.
Like I said, yeah --
So boring, so useless --
I know alotta women and I'm sure she remembers me.
Mm. Hm.
I'm quietly judging you.
Hollywood, mainly.
"Go Get 'Em, Honey."
Not a problem.
...this close...
Well I guess the question is this: Do you remember Miss Simms?
...are you Phil...?
I got your message.  That you were trying to get me -- right?
I just...he was...but I gave him, I just had to give him a small dose of liquid morphine.  He hasn't been able to swallow the morphine pills so we now, I just had to go to the liquid morphine... For the pain, you understand?
About three weeks ago.
Calm down.
Then you've got nothin' to worry about.
No one else in here?
Maybe so, but I'm gonna ask you one more time: Is Anyone Else In This House Right Now?
I'm not askin', Marcie.
What's this, how did this happen?
If she asks me any question I want to tell her.  I want to tell her everything I've done.
I need you to get me Paula --
Are you alright?
I'm sorry, Stanley.
I went to see her -- some fuckin' asshole answers the door in his underwear, he's fifty years old, there's coke and shit laid out on the table --
She went crazy.  She went crazy, Rose.
I don't know.  I have to go, I don't have time and I have more drinking to do before I go march --
Paula.  Ellen.
Is it over 'cause you're sick?
Well maybe.
Do you feel better now that you've said this?
I'm not mad.  I am, but I'm not.  Y'know?
I'm not through asking my questions.
<u>I don't know what I've done</u>.
I don't know what I've done.
Are you her boyfriend?
What's MOW?
No they don't --
Like a shrink, like if I go to see a shrink, I'm protected, I can say things -- fuck -- I don't know what I'm doing --
-- I have something to tell you. I have to tell you something. I want to change his will, can I change his will?...I need to ---
No, no....no, you see...I never loved him. I never loved him, Earl.  When I started, when I met him, I met him and I fucked him and I married him because I wanted his money, do you understand?  I'm telling you this now...this I've never told anyone...I didn't love him. And now....I know I'm in that will, I know, I was there with him, we were all there together when we made that fucking thing and all the money I'II get -- I don't want it -- Because I love him so much now...I've fallen in love with him now, for real, as he's dying, and I look at him and he's about to go, Alan, he's dead...he's moments...  I took care of him through this, Alan. And What Now Then?
You don't have to change the will, if what you want to do is get nothing you can renounce the will when it's time.
Well.  Considering that there's no one else mentioned in the will...we'd have to go to the laws of intestacy, which is -- as if someone died without a will --
-- unless Frank is specifically ommitted as a beneficiary that's what will happen.
Shut the fuck up.
-- what-what-what, ma'am -- I --
Hi. I'd like to get an order for delivery.
Ok. One of those. Do you have Ram Rod? The magazine, Ram Rod?
Thank you.
That's pretty cool.
Love you too.
See you.
I'm fine. nothing.
Yes.
Go to bed.
It's ok.
I have money to give you.
It's raining frogs from the sky.
This happens....this is something that happens.
I understand you saved my son's life today.
If I don't kiss you, I die anyway.
First they told me he had died at birth.  Then your father admitted he was alive, but well cared for, in secret.  But the message that told of his death said he had been a prisoner.
Perhaps you can find out who this secret leader of the Jesuits is. You are now a priest, but you were once a Musketeer, serving the throne of France, a throne ordained of God. Can you accept this mission, and keep it private?
Soon enough.  Here we are.
Come, we have a boat waiting.
There is that, of course -- but mainly it is because I am so much smarter than everyone else.
But -- what is he doing?
He's threatened to do it, it's been building up in him for months.
The mask is terrifying... especially when unexpected.  Do you notice?
He can learn to be Phillippe in time.  But first he must learn to be Louis, and for that he has two more days.
Hold your goblet with two fingers.
I will need you all.  All for one. One for all.
I know.  God go with you.
I trained those men myself.  They will stand and fight.  But if we are to die, let it be this way.
Hell may be our destination, dear Porthos, but not this trip.
Jesus of Nazareth found the holy among the profane.  If we are to have a place of private prayer, where better than here, beside the channels where the shit and the garbage run to the river?
So they tell us.  But what are we to believe when the king is a tyrant, and the Church, meant to stand for all those oppressed, has become the tool of oppression?  When no conscience is tolerated?  No dissent, no objection?
I expected action.  There was no killing, no fighting, I was useless.
I carried the king's child!  The queen had twins that night, and one of them was sent away, in secret!
Why didn't you say so?
We will make our own luck tonight... if Phillippe holds up.
None of the ladies will be able to take their eyes off you.
She died giving you to me.  And I want to die knowing it is one the finger of the women my son loves.
Life is too long.  Except when we have our friends.  Look at you! You're still a boy!  Sit, sit!  I'll open a bottle of wine.
I fear I know our King.  I came to try to bring you hope.
Save my son, d'Artagnan.
Get out of my way.
Perhaps not as much as you might imagine.  When tutors answered every question except those about who I was.  When I was imprisoned in a way no other man had ever been, I knew there was something different about me.  But a king...
She will be at the ball.
If I could have a blade, then I would be please to run with you.
I decided it this morning.
I am King, d'Artagnan.  I will change my mind as I wish, and I will enjoy my banquet as I wish!
Not criticize -- plead.  Love.  Love your people, and you will not bear to see them hungry.  Love women, and they will love you.  Love yourself, and --
You will protect me as you always have, d'Artagnan.
It shall be done, your Majesty.
Yes, your Majesty.
There.
Sire, we have an emergency -- of security.  I must ask you to accompany me.
No, Keeper.
No.  He cut an ear from one of the men, no one else was hurt.  Captain d'Artagnan allowed him to leave. Athos was upset about the death of his son, at the front.
Not by you.  I will order d'Artagnan to do it.
Out directing the search for the traitors.
It's lovely.  It's just...
Or worse, we'll have a hostage situation on our hands.
Where are you?
Fine...
It's just...catching up with me, you know?
And who are you?
Did he harm the girl?
No Zydowski I didn't read today's paper - it's just going to irritate the hell out of me.
No...
I didn't.  I figured you leave it well enough alone.
No.  A witness.
What happened with the tape?
Look, Jimmy, you know, I haven't seen you in eight years, you show up to my door like you're on drugs - now the least you could do is tell me what the fuck is going on!
It was self-defense, Tubbs! They're dirty!  I walked in on something, I don't know what -
Did you have sex with her?
Did you have sexual intercourse with the woman in question?
I asked him not to tell me where he was going.  I told him I don't want any part of it.
He doesn't think you run mind games on him.
Why aren't you ever alone with him?
That's when it happened?
What's the bottom line?
If the Tooth Fairy listens to Lecktor, he'll come for me. So we're going to set me up as bait to draw him out. Give him a clean shot.  That's what you were thinking, isn't it?
Right.  What about sweating Lecktor?
That's it. Lecktor called him a Pilgrim when he was talking to me...
Nobody's better with evidence. But he has the other thing, too. He doesn't like that part of it...
I don't want to talk about it anywhere.  If you brought pictures, leave them in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin will be back soon.
I think there has been a lot of bullshit about the way I think.  I came down here to get away from all that.
As long as they're dead...
He's working on the single print index. What time is it?
What do you want to do?
I know...
To recover the mind set.
The mark? Yes.
I'll tell you in a second. Now listen to me: everything is okay, I'm taking care of it, so stay on the phone when I tell you.
What's it narrow down to?
When I'm done.
'Changes?'
VTR, film, Polaroid, stills, what?
I want a chopper on the roof in three minutes. To Meigs Field.  At Meigs have them warn up and flight- prep the Gulf Stream.
Put your back against the door. Come forward three steps until you feel the tile on your feet and there will be a stool just to your left.
No, thanks. I manage very well.  I'll order you twelve hundred feet: of 1000 C tomorrow.
I have work to do at the plant.
I'm fine, Francis.
Me.
The Tooth...
Atoning, Mr. Lounds.
Yes.
No. I don't want to see you.
Oh, God.
Yes.
'I have had a great privilege. I have seen with wonder the strength of the Red Dragon. All I wrote about him before was lies from Will Graham. He made me write them. Now I understand.  'Will Graham: you will learn from my own lips how much you have to dread. Because I was forced to lie, he will be more merciful to me than to you.  'I will be a testament to the truth, now.  About his work. About his becoming.'
Dr. Chilton.
I'll bet she has a call caddy right next to her phone.
Now I'll bet it has his home address there, too
No. I can help you.
That's true.
He only bit women so far, right?
Psychologists call him a sociopath. They don't know what else to call him.
I call him a monster.
I'm a forensic specialist, Molly. You've seen my diploma?  I got a diploma and everything.
Huh?  Will? Is that you?
I don't know. I'm goin' up to Baltimore this afternoon.
Yeah. Ah... yellow, let's paint it yellow.
Hey, goddamn it, paint it shit-brown for all I care...  Look, I'm sorry. When I come home, we'll go to the paint store together and get some chips and...
I remember.
No.
My grandboy's been eatin' a ton of breakfast every day. Been out riding. Must be the good air. You oughta see that little booger eat.  I'll bet he's gained ten pounds.  Molly's out in the motor home...
What's that?
I'll come inside with you, if you like, but Mr. Crawford said you'd probably want to be alone.
There's a VTR setup waiting in your hotel room, that you asked for. They transferred the home movies of both families onto half-inch VHS.
Go on to the house...
Are you George Sherman?
I'll hang around in here. I'll just be in the kitchen, Mom...
No. You're very well-protected.  No one can find our where you are.
...yes.
I got it. Thank you.
Very interesting, even to a layman.
You read about it, I'm sure.
There are things you don't have. Research materials... I could speak to the Chief of Staff...?
No. I knew that I'm not smarter than you are.
No.
Big backyards, fences, some hedges, why?
That's interesting.
I haven't decided yet.
Do you know how you caught me, Will?
I'm worn out with you crazy sons-of- bitches. If you've got something to say, Lecktor, say it.
It feels good because: if you do as God does, enough times, you become as God is: powerful...
Yes.
...commercially prohibited.  Number Twelve shot in liquid Teflon in a copper casing. On impact it all opens up in the target. Expect the recoil. They're hot loads.  Body armor?
I'm not a comedian.  I have no talent.  I'm a song-and-dance man.
"No"?  "No" to which part??
Of course.  But only on Monday nights.
What's up?
You're DAMN RIGHT you're sorry!  And you -- you're the road manager! You should be watchin' out for him!
Hi, Andy.  How's the weather up there?
There'll be other shots.
What, you don't think I can beat him?
Y-yeah?  Well, then it has to stop! Because if these bad vibes get out... then everyone will be talkin' about how sick I am, and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, and then -- I'm dead.
Ehhh, you know those guys.  If he had his way, I'd be stuck in the hospital, running tests all day.  And anyway, I've found a new guy who's gonna be able to instantly remove the cancer.
Eh, I dunno... Andy.  I'm... thinkin' of letting you go...
Okay, great!  So let's reset!
Do you wanna wrestle?  It's a good way of breaking the ice.  That instant physical intimacy really brings two people together.
No no no, it's not sex!  I mean -- it can lead to sex... but really, it's just wrestling.
Hi... am I late?
Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond."
Then your father's a wimp.
You're a wimp.
Are you nuts?!  40 million people watch you every week!
She'll say, "Now my son is a man."
What is this, World War Two...?
And you say, "Santa, what am I gettin' for Christmas?"  And he says, "Cancer!"
Yes, your Holiness?
I'll take my chances!!
I don't know what yer talkin' about. You musta talked to someone else --
Look... I don't know what your problem is...
They're gonna lynch him!
No way.  Not possible.
Should Tank I.D. it?
Don't tell me you're a believer now?
He's going to pop!
... Yeah.
Really?
How many were there?
I got you.
I know, Trinity.  Don't worry.  He's going to make it.
I've been looking for you, Neo.  I don't know if you're ready to see what I want to show you, but unfortunately, we have run out of time.  They're coming for you, Neo. And I'm not sure what they're going to do.
I can guide you out, but you have to do exactly what I say.
How do you know all this?
Because I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.
Far from it.
A.I.?  You mean artificial intelligence?
The body cannot live without the mind.
No, Neo.  I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready, you won't have to.
Yes.  She's very old.  She's been with us since the beginning.
That I would find the One.
That's why we're here.
Faith is beyond the reach of whys and why nots.  These things are not a matter of cause and effect, Neo. I do not believe things with my mind.  I believe them with my heart. In my gut.
Morpheus, I don't know --
Ten hours straight.  He's a machine.
I need the main wet-wall.
Goddamn!  It's good to hear your voice, sir!
How did you know...?
Honestly?  I don't know.
What?
What?
It's necessary, Neo.  For our protection.
From you.
Why?
Easy, Neo.  Easy.
It disables any electrical system in the blast radius.  It's the only weapon we have against the machines.
It might have been.  I'm not sure.
I'm not the One, Trinity.  The Oracle hit me with that too.
I'm sorry, I'm not.  I'm just another guy.  Morpheus is the one that matters.
Why?
Do what?
Deep underground.  Near the earth's core, where it's still warm.  You live long enough, you might even see it.
The Oracle.
Neo, this has to be done!
Guns.  Lots of guns.
I can't!
I don't know.  I lost him.
Thanks.
Let go of her.
Yeah, well, keep away from those Chinx.  They don't have shit.
Well the guy over there said...
And cherry bombs...ash cans...and rockets?
Ok.  Wait here.
'Take a little tip from Mack the Knife...'
Anybody wanna have a game?
Sure.  And you're gonna take the vows next Tuesday, right.
Not quite...but keep trying.
Charlie, I swear on my mother, you're not going to believe this.
Wouldn't bother me.
Ok, ok...take it easy.  I'll show. Tuesday I'll give Michael something. I promise.
Listen...I'm a guest here.
Stupid bastard...you get your cousin half-sick over this.
Did you see them run!
I understand.
You tell me that in front of these creeps?
Charlie, twenty-eight bucks is nothing.  The only way to do it is through your uncle...think about it will you?
No.
What pipes?
For these prices don't be particular. That's all they had - but next week we'll see...
Isn't he supposed to be here tonight...I mean...
Get him in.
'But I say to you, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute...'
'But I say to you not to resist the evildoer; on the contrary, if someone takes thy tunic, let him take thy cloak as well...to him who asks of thee, give; and from him who would borrow of thee do not turn away!
I know.
No...his business is bad.  But I'll decide what to do and you...and you just keep out of anything that might...might...er draw attention to you.
Ok.
What I don't understand is why you have to go to college to read these books that you're gonna read anyway.
Teresa.
Ok, we'll go for lunch.
Anything specific?
I know you don't.  You've been very preoccupied lately.
You're intolerable today.
Uhuh...probably a good idea.  Why don't you do it this time?
I know...I know.
Which one, the big tab or the little tab?
We'll close up as soon as everybody leaves.
Quiet please.
And isn't it a lovely one?  So sturdy, so straight --
He's coming.
Unfortunately.  I sat between them at the Bronx Zoo benefit -- it was better than Seconal.
Hi, Allison --
Allison, I trust you.  This is your thing.
Calm down, Daddy, you'll see, you're going to love it.
And you could care less --
We've got some things to discuss.
Of course.
Yeah?  And what about my enemies?
No jocks?  A twenty-game winner or a Masters champion?  Someone I could talk to.  Or would talk to me.
Yeah, they hit the calf over the head with a mallet and then Luisa hits it again in the kitchen.
But what?
I thought you were buying my company.
Hello.  I'm Joe Black.  Nice to meet you.
Yeah.  Goodnight.
Bill's birthday is the day after tomorrow.  There is a provisory by- law in our charter.  Per the discre- tion of the Board, Corporate off- icers can be retired at age sixty- five.
Here...
Why yes, thank you.
"Death and Taxes"?
Susan's patient is whom we are talking about.
Not good, not bad, you know what we got?  Nothing.  No credit, no cars, no mortgages -- no wives.  Nothing.
-- And now you're going to pee some more.
A voice?
Sorry.  I know it looks like I'm reversing my field.
I am now.
But the matter's still on the table, Bill --
Certainly, Bill.
Quince, m'man, thanks for the offer, but it's all set for just me and Bill. More people might --
Are you?
'It's up to Joe', huh?
Well, that's very interesting.
You're on, Quin-cee.  Destination Hospital.  Joe, you'll be the Tour Guide.  Okay?  How's that sound to you?
Make it go 'way.
Make it time.
Yes.
She knows you real self?
Only flowers I wan' see's one's over my peaceful self restin' in the dutty.
Hi, Jennifer.
I didn't know that.
No.
I'm lost.
Peanut butter.
That's impossible.  I'm a doctor, I'm --
Patients have visitors, not doctors.
Be sorry for nothing.
I thought you said 'Be sorry for nothing'.
It wasn't an intrusion.  And if it was, it turned out to be welcome.
We're doing what we can for her. But it doesn't look good.
I said get out.
I am.
Maybe it's the draft through the door.
I loved it.
Yes!
You want me to wait for you, you'll be back --
Joe knows what you're saying, just being polite --
I didn't know her.  The body I took knew her.  The man she met in the coffee shop this morning.  I - uh - took him.
That's the best I can do.  ...but minute-by-minute, I find myself lingering.
I hope you realize, Bill...in your office this morning, that was your time.
Not at all.
What do you mean?
Of course.
Make an exception?
That's what everybody says.
Oh.  Okay.
I wouldn't put it that way.
Are you going to fire me, Bill?
Well, you goddam well should.  You walk into my life, give me the worst news a guy can get, have me dancing on the heads of pins with my busi- ness and with my family, and now you're spooning with my daughter.
What are you saying, that it's time to go?
Some aimless infatuation in which, for the moment, you feel like in- dulging.  It's missing everything that matters.
I don't expect you to.
I'll take it from here --  I am --
An indictable offense.
I am not a dream.
You're not Death.  You're just a kid in a jacket and a pair of pants.
I'm here.
Quiet.
Time.
Watch it!
Bill.  Come on.  The question.  The question you've been asking yourself with increased regularity, at odd moments, panting through the extra game of handball, when you ran for the plane in Delhi, when you sat up in bed last night and hit the floor in the office this morning.  The question that is in the back of your throat, choking the blood to your brain, ringing in the ears over and over as you put it to yourself --
Yes, Bill.  The question.
I'm doing great.  You ready?
Joe, you don't know how glad I am you're aboard.  Anybody who can take some of the weight off the old man, I'm in his corner.
Please, Eddie, no 'Fat Lady Sings" shit.
No, I'm going to stay down here, keep my finger in the dike and maybe by Monday, the waters could recede.
I know it's none of my business --
And I'm your daughter and no man will ever be good enough for me.
Bravo.
Yer damn right.
Now we love Drew and Joe in verbo- ten?  What's going on?
Where's he going?
I'm having a helluva time.
The fireworks are about to start.
You and 'Honey'?
So you're a one-girl guy?
I could be her.
And I want to get into my apartment and go to work.  Please, what do you say, another cup of coffee?
'Pro bono'.  That means doing good -- Going to be doing good all your life?
You never know.  Lightning could strike.
Did I say something wrong?
Because I like you so much.  You have coffee here every morning, don't you?  If I came by, could you give me the name of a doctor?
No --
Relax a little, okay? Take off your jacket.
Sense of humour went with the memory, huh? You know why you're still here, don't you?
No. Just leave the stuff lying around as if it were yours. Like you just took it off or something.
I'm sorry... um... ?
No. It's different. I have no short-term memory. I know who I am and all about myself, but since my injury I can't make any new memories. Everything fades. If we talk for too long, I'll forget how we started. I don't know if we've ever met before, and the next time I see you I won't remember this conversation. So if I seem strange or rude, that's probably...
Couple days.
What?
Yeah?
Who did this to you?
Don't be too hard on yourself.
Sorry.
There are things you know for sure.
Where is he?
He'll kill you, Lenny.
I told him about your car.
Get rid of Dodd for me.
I can talk about whoever the fuck I want! You won't even remember what I say! I can tell you that your wife was a fucking whore and we can still be friends!
Maybe it is! How the fuck would you know?! You don't know a fucking thing! You can't get scared, can you get angry?!
* John G. was clever. He took the dead man's gun and replaced it with the sap that he'd hit me with. He left my gun and left the getaway car. He gave the police a complete package. They found a sap with my blood on it in the dead man's hand, and they only found my gun. They didn't need to look for anyone else. I was the only guy who disagreed with the facts, and I had brain damage.						 *
Who's your boyfriend?
Are you Teddy?
You have no idea where you've just come from? What you've just done?
Lemme take you down in the basement and show you what you've become.
Mr Gammell?
You don't have to remember to be hungry.
Well, the other day you made it sound like you thought somebody might be trying to set you up. Get you to kill the wrong guy.
He took away the woman I love and he took away my memory. He destroyed everything; my life and my ability to live.
Why?
How'd ya get him in here in the first place?
Fucking hope not.
What's wrong with this one?
She's involved with these drug dealers.
Why not?  MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99
So in your grief you wandered into a Jaguar dealership?
I know, you investigated. Maybe you need to apply some of your investigative skills to yourself.
That, and your thing.						   *
Sammy didn't have a wife.
I guess I can only make you believe the things you want to be true, huh? Like ol'		   * Jimmy down there.
Why would I have a gun?
Doing...?
What's your twenty?
Turn around.
Grieve elsewhere.
Good.
Three wakes off the back of those boats.  Who runs three Sterling engines off a deep-V hull?
You said Nazi Low-riders...?
Tell them what you want.
Meth precursors and the Dutch party favors are en route.
Okay.
And what is that?
Later!  Do you dance?
Died in childbirth, having me...
That's right.
'Cause we <u>guarantee</u> every load.  Anywhere, for any reason, it comes up short, we make good.  Your operations will, from now on, run risk-free.
I need thirty.  Calculate in, also, the cash you don't have to front...
Why?
Do I need it?
When?
Maybe.  Maybe with the crazy whites.
We could try to run loads into these guys.  Run a few loads for Montoya into South Florida.  Into this group.
Nothing.
No.
Verdado.
It's in the suburbs outside Havana.
No.  Havana, Louisiana.  Don't we have a meet?
As in...?
What's your Miami PD badge number?
...so there's <u>no</u> industrial- strength HRT weapons team out there tonight?
Who's the "we"?  There's you and there's us.  And all we got from you was bad intel.  "Low-level producer."  Yeah, right...
Haiti and Puerto Rico.  Money through Dubai and Geneva maybe.
I'm my <u>own</u> man.  And anytime you want to see how much man I am?
Sonny...?
They got a steady stream of supply. So, no...
The bouquet, here.  Five-hundred dollars worth of roses...yellow.
José doesn't like the deal in South Florida...
They're serious.  They're cautious. They'll forgo a deal over a technicality of how a delivery's handled...they'd walk away, rather than compromise operational security...that's good.
I had to lay eyes on you.
You don't like us finding your load?  We can go and lose it all over again...
They lied.
Men, they mostly faggots.
Sure you're all right?
Y -- what in hell starts with Y?
For what?
My friend O'Daniel. That's who you need. Operates the biggest stable in town. In the whole goddam metropolitan area. A stud like you - paying! -- not that I blame you -- a dame starts crying, I cut my heart for her...
Not a cent, I swear to God, I swear on my mother's eyes.
Shee-it, man, I can't say all that.
Rico! Rico! Rico! Is that enough?  And keep your meat hooks off my radio.
What's all this sweet talk about Florida? Your friend O'Daniel got a stable down there now?
You talk like a man with a tin twat.
Well, uh, my manager's gonna manage all that crap, or else he gonna get a coconut up his flue.
You like it? Take a look.
What I'm gonna do, I'm gonna make a cowboy outta you, kid. How about that? Build you up a little, teach you couple little tricks'n turn y'out to stud, Rat-stuff.
Forty-second Street. Where'n hell you think it come from?
Yeah, well, so?
Rico. Rico Rizzo.
No. But while you was buying the underwear, I could have lifted the socks.
And what?
I been thinking. I hope we're not gonna have a lotta trouble about my name down there. Because like what's the whole point of this trip anyway?
What?
No, yes. No, I mean yes please go. Help me to be good. Come back tomorrow. Promise.
Ready for anything.
Who's he? Oh God! Don't tell me you two are a couple -- ?
Is he all right!
...He had a bald skull and...
Yeah, what do you think this is, the good USA? This is Turkey, man... ) It's a fucking accident here if you're innocent. And anyway... ...ain't nobody who's innocent.
Nah, just covered with batshit!
Shit.
Dad...  I'll pay you back for all this, I Promise.
Nothing. Just twisted my ankle.
Well, it's an interesting place...  Tell you the truth, I think the food is lousy. The crap they sell in these little restaurants. I went out to eat in one of them last night, and I had to run to the damn toilet... You shoulda' seen the toilet.
For the money... )
I know.
Good. Now, where did you get the hashish?
Something like that. Cigarette?
Let's hope so, Billy.  Let's sure hope so.
What did he do?
Twelve years.
A hundred grams.
That doesn't seem so bad.
What do you mean?
Yeah.
It's a dead end. The Turks musta' sealed it up.
Yeah.
You know where it is?
Cat, ah!  Ayip!
It's not important, just technical things. We make our case.  You were very good, you spoke well. The Judge like you. It look good. Don't worry.
Who?
Okay, Jeremy...go get Dr. Chris Raymond, will you?
Selling your sould for a fistful of carbohydrates...
Yeah, and a loudspeaker so you can yell "Epidemic! Epidemic! You're all going to die!"
New York's finest.
Right.
Yeah, and you gonna have to show me a lot bigger one you wanna go down there. That's the old maintenance grid, Doc. Swiss cheese: tunnels, tracks...
You wanna keep up the conversation, you best come back with the proper permits and the right attitude.
All right, motherfucker, that's it.
Yeah, I feel like ripping your fucking eyes out...
Go!! Just go!!
"...and behold he will come that walks as a man, yet is not a man- ..."
We'll find him. We'll be back and find him.
Please.
Is this a Catholic guilt thing...?
Monks bottle their own wine. Don't they?
We?
No, there's...
Susan, we're not b-
It didn't bite me.
That's camouflage...
What-
We can do it!
You the bug lady, right?
Oh, Jesus.
No shit.
What?
I know.  Help me get a sample.
I know. It's so upsetting. I'm his number-one fan...I've got all his books, every sentence he ever put down. I'm so proud of my Paul Sheldon collection...  ...here I am, prattling on and my manners have just flown away. I haven't invited you in. Please.
How long...?
If you wouldn't mind.
I don't have a title yet.
Nothing.
Oh, it's ridiculous, who am I to make a criticism to someone like you?
Well, it's brilliantly written, but then everything you write is brilliant.
It has no nobility.
The phones are working?
I DIDN'T...
Show me the way?
You know, Annie, this book never would have survived without you. When it gets to new York, there will be a big auction, and whatever it brings we can split.  God knows you're entitled to it.
You're right. You're right. I don't know what I was thinking. I'll tell you what. It doesn't have to be published. Nobody ever has to see it. I'll just keep it for myself. No one will ever have to know it exists.
Great.
That's the big surprise. Your new studio--after all, writers do need a place to work.
You did great, except there's just one little thing--I can't work with this paper. It's Corrasable Bond, it smudges. Maybe you could go back into town and bring me some white, long-grained mimeo.
No, just the paper will be fine.
Annie, what's the matter?
I want my pain to go 'way, Annie-- make it go 'way, please Annie--  --please...
--cliff-hangers--
Wait, let's do this right. Do you have any candles?
What?
I'm glad you like it.
It will.
You'll know very soon. I'm starting the last chapter. And when I finish, I want everything to be perfect. I'll require three things.
What? What is it?
He might well be. But not the way they say. He didn't crawl out of that car by himself. You saw those dents on the door--someone pulled him out.
Well, whoever she is, she sure likes to read a lot.
Maybe you can, Libby.
No long-distance phone calls, Federal Express packages--anything at all out of the ordinary?
Are you kidding? Every time that fella writes a book, she makes me set aside the first copy.
No, the typing kind.
It's... it's nice, Paul. It's got... character.
Not a bad business. This thing would still be growing, too. The first printing order on Misery's Child was the most ever--over a million.
I'm delighted the critics are liking it, and I hope the people like it, too. But it's not why I wrote the book.
Paul, since you brought her up, I have to ask you this, or I'd be drummed out of the agents' union-- what about a non-fiction book? The truth about what went on in that house.
All done, chief..
In the envelope in my pocket.  My right.. jacket..pocket..
How hard you had to work to get me out of there..how in the world did you ever find me?
Maybe that's it, then.  Everything's upside down and backwards...
To do what?
And you're going to have time.  There's been a change of plans.
Good.  Biocyte stock is just a week or two away from going through the roof.
And you're happy about that?
It's okay.  She scrambled the transmission.  Luther, continue feeding the GPS her position.
I'll be damned.  It's McCloy, the Biocyte CEO.
What are you talking about?
What manic invents  disease like that in the first place?  Why would he do it?
I hope there's a place to land.
No.  Just as if I'd like to.
What if I pay the rent?
Working under adverse conditions.  Highly adverse conditions.
You didn't do that badly.
Damn, you're beautiful.
And six billion in the world.
I'd like a little more conviction..
I don't.
Generally, I don't favor coercing someone. Not when there's a chance my life could end up in their hands.
Betting table twelve off the paddock. Nyah, are you up to this?
I am now.  Get me out of here.  Just get me out of here.
Why did you phrase it like that?
Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich is dead.  So is his colleague, Gradski, but that happened earlier.  We had Nekhorvich on a flight from Sydney that crashed in the Rockies..
Twice.
You know we had reservations about each other.  Isn't it a little late in the day to be asking me that?
The question is why?  What was this Chimera Nekhorvich was carrying?
In any case, you've got to recover Chimera and bring it to us.
Well you know Nekhorvich's history. You're the one who got him out of the Soviet Union was it still in bio- weapon business.
You mean it'll be difficult.
We could lock down passport control and all ports of authority, but that won't stop Ambrose, and beyond him, we don't know who else we're looking for -- all terrorist bank accounts of which we're aware are stable.  No deposits, no withdrawals.  Therefore no suspects.
But that leaves another seven or eight pints of Chimera.
Oh, you don't have to do that. Wouldn't be a vacation if you did.
Yes, he knew.  Just..
No.  After you've lived with <i>Chimera</i> for twenty hours, nothing can save you.  Not even...<i>Bellerophon.</i>
Right.  I guess there aren't many flu epidemics in the middle of summer.
Left jacket pocket?
All storage and production of Chimera is done here, in this lab on the forty-second floor, the heart of the building.
I'm not waiting 48 hours.  When we're done at Biocyte, if she's not out of Ambrose's, I'm going in and getting her out.
You're right, of course.
What about him...?
And if we donít find him - weíll search the whole train again.
High speed train.  No-one gets on.  No- one gets off.  High security.  Good place for a pass off to Max.
This is bullshit - we donít even know what Max looks like.
Walk, just walk.  Start walking.
If you're gonna do this again Claire, It's not gonna be on my watch.
Roger that.
No, I got out of the car and I ran to the bridge.
I walked away.  He said abort.  He was gone so I walked away.
Who is "they?"
Who is they, who is they?
I've been disavowed.  They think I killed Jim and everyone else.  Somehow a hundred thousand dollars found its way into my parents' bank account.  Kittridge assumes I'm a mole they've been tracing and I've been in the employ of an arms dealer, Max, for the last two years, to get him our NOC list.
I'm going to answer it.
Do you read me?  <u>The list is in the open</u>!
Heard a lot about you, Hunt.  Donít disappoint me.
Yeah.
Yeah.  I follow you.
Why was there another team?
Of IMF agents.  At the Embassy.  Tonight.
This whole operation was a molehunt.
Profitable.
Luther, I guess you're all out of excuses.
Oh man...I don't know.  I'm gonna miss being disreputable.
That depends.
Even so, I'm sure you could arrange an introduction.
Because I can deliver the actual NOC list.  The one you have is not only worthless, it's certain to be equipped with a homing device to pinpoint your exact location.
Okay, boot it up and in anywhere from thirty seconds to ten minutes you're gonna have Virginia farm boys hopping around you like jackrabbits.
Tell you what.  How good's the RF scanner you used in the car?
Okay, use it.  But I suggest pack up first.
I don't have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession -- like a warm blanket.  My deal with Job was subject to a successful boot scan.  Obviously it didn't pass muster.  Deal's off.
What about Job?
My contact is extremely shy.
Always.
What about my coat?  I'll freeze.
Why?
Allowing Max to see you and hear what you've got to say.
I'd say you've got about two minutes.
Wonderful.  Ran into a convention of auto dealers at the Drake Hotel.  You hear the one about the astronaut who comes back from the first manned flight to Mars after two years?  His wife's got a year old kid.  So he says "All right.  Who was it?  My friend Harry?"  She says no. "Oh, it was my friend Sammy."  She says it wasn't Sammy.  "Oh, I suppose it was my friend Lou."  "No, what's the matter, don't you think I have any friends of my own?!"
He's our guy.
Not this week. This week he's flyfishing at the Oughterard Slough in County Kildare, with one of our best Irish guides.
No, not in a hurry.  What do you think? You think the plot'll work?
We were forced to tie him to my best stallion and drag him around the barn a few times.
If I supposedly deliver the NOC list to Max, Max has agreed to deliver Job to me. Iíll have Claire and Luther Stickell with me on the train.  Marcel Krieger will have helicopter transport waiting in Paris.
Youíre wrong about one thing.  Iím not the only one whoís seen you alive.
Of course I can hear you.
I always check the batteries.
And I'll have the special fish.
And go to confession.
Johnny Cammareri. I think it's great and about time. What's she gonna do with the rest of her life she don't get married?
You do, huh? Stick around. Don't go on any long trips.
No! Bad luck! Your Ma and I been married fifty-two years an nobody died. You were married, what, two years, and somebody is dead. Don't get married again, Loretta. It don't work out for you. Who's the man?
What'd you do to your hair?
What are you doing here?
I don't know what to advise my son. I think he should pay for the wedding, but it is important that he don't look ridiculous.
I'm calling for your brother Johnny. He's getting married and he wants you to come.
He's in Palermo.
Yes. Do you want...
I don't understand.
Maybe I should come back another time.
That's the bad blood between you and Johnny?
So. Five years ago your hand got cut off and your woman left you for another man. No woman since then?
Just Johnny.
You got any whiskey? How 'bout giving me a glass of whiskey?
Me neither.
All my life I have never reached a man. I knew that I would reach my husband, but I took my time and he was dead. Ronny.
I've never seen a moon like that.
All right, I'm guilty. I confess!
I can't!
That you come with me tonight. Once. To the Opera.
He was having some fun. Yeah, well he's dead.  Come on, let's go in.
You're late!
I was.
I got a lot on my mind, Aunt Rita.
Hi.
No?
Maybe you're right.
She was too young for him.
Bobo, take the cart away.
Where? At the City Hall? No! I want the whole wedding or we will have Bad Luck. For a whole wedding to be planned, a date must be set.
I'll take care of it, Johnny. I'll take care of the whole thing. All you have to do is show up.
You have a brother?
Sure.
Loretta, I can't marry you.
If I marry you my mother will die.
Good. When you love them they drive you crazy cause they know they can. But you like him?
Johnny has a big apartment. We'll live there.
I'd like to stay, Ma. I love the house. But Pop don't like Johnny.
Just like your father. I lied to him. He thinks you came home last night.
A wife knows.
Where's pop?
Hey there  ...YOU WITH THE STARS IN YOUR EYES...
Did you see it?
You gotta date?
Hi. Why ain't you at the store?
The bank. OH MY GOD, I FORGOT TO MAKE THE DEPOSIT!
You should think about this.
Alright. This is your penance. Say two rosaries and... be careful, Loretta. Reflect on your life.
I have heard that Johnny Cammareri got down on his knees in The Grand Ticino and proposed to her.
Maybe. I don't know. He has not asked my advice. If he asks my advice, I don't know what I will say.
What are you doing here? You're supposed to be in Palermo.
Then tell her I'll come by in the morning. We need to talk.
You're forty-two years old, Johnny, and Mama is still running your life.
What happened?
I'm not disturbed. By you.
That woman was a student of yours?
I teach these classes I've taught for a million years. The spontaneity went out of it for me a long time ago. I started off, I was excited about something and I wanted to share it. Now it's rote, it's the multiplication table. Except sometimes. Sometimes I'm droning along and I look up, and there's this fresh young beautiful face, and it's all new to her and I'm this great guy who's just brilliant and thinks out loud. And when that happens, when I look out among those chairs and look at a young woman's face, and see me there in her eyes, me the way I always wanted to be and maybe once was, then I ask her out on a date. It doesn't last. It can go for a few weeks or a couple of precious months, but then she catches on that I'm just a burnt out old gasbag and that she's as fresh and bright and full of promise as moonlight in a martini. And at that moment, she stands up and throws a glass of water in my face, or some action to that effect.
Yes.
Oh.
Did you dress her up like this?
I am...  And this my trusty servant, Patsy. We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join our court at Camelot..  I must speak with your lord and master.
What do you mean?
Well, it doesn't matter.   Go and tell your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here.
But the Grail ... where is the Grail!?
The Britons.
I am your king!
You don't vote for kings.
You must return here with a shrubbery or else ...  you shall not pass through this wood alive!
Oh, please!
I cannot tell you.  Suffice to say is one of the words the Knights of Ni! cannot hear!
Come on you pansy!
You'll what ... ?
You're a looney.
Come, Patsy.
Oh, just some friends!
Who did we lose?
Man!
I'm thirty-seven.
Shut up, will you. Shut up!
Well, don't. |      I really don't know where all this got started. It's like those miserable psalms.  they're so depressing. Now knock it of
I'm not dead!
To find the Holy Grail.
What is the capital of Assyria?
I can't take him.
Er, Well ... the thing is ... I thought your son was a lady.
Oh ... that's awfully nice.
Don't like her?   What's wrong with her?  She's beautiful ... she's rich ... she's got huge tracts of land ...
Shut up!  You only killed the bride's father - that's all -
Got it?
No ... just keep him in here.
Okay.  Fine.  We'll remain here until you get back.
The Prince ... ?
Oh, I see,  Right.
Yes.  It's not a very good name, is it?  But we are nice and we shall attend to your every ... every need!
What is your name, handsome knight?
I'm afraid our life must seem very dull and quiet compared to yours.  We are but eightscore young blondes, all between sixteen and nineteen-and-a-half, cut off in this castle, with no one to protect us.  Oooh.  It is a lonely life ... bathing ... dressing ... undressing ... making exciting underwear....
We'll cover your escape!
No, really, I can cope.  I can handle this lot easily!
No, no, we must find the Grail.
No, I'm not.
Back to your bed!  At once!
You got my note!
Yes!  With a herring!  With a herring!  Cut down with a herring!
Stop saying the word!  The word we cannot hear!  The word ...
Look.  I'm warning you.
Did I tell you?  Did you listen to me?  Oh no, no, you knew better didn't you?  No, it's just an ordinary rabbit isn't it.  The names you called me.  Well, don't say I didn't tell you.
Shut up.  Oh, nobody really. just passing through.
I think he nearly ruptured his truss.
Seventy a year.
You know what I mean.
I'm on ninety pounds a year plus seventy pounds for a pile of tartan I'd be wearing anyway.  That's as much as a Page of the Back Stairs gets and that job's only for toffs.  I'm Her Majesty's Highland Servant! Indoors and Out.  There's no stopping me now.
She'll be worried about me.
Oh, I'm much more than that.
Aye.
I can't move to tidy.
Yeah, yeah, I did.
Yeah.
I don't think I've had that pleasure.
She's away to Windsor tomorrow.  Talk to her there.
Out of my way!
I do believe they send so many boxes to taunt me. Doctor Jenner writes to them to say that my nerves are in an extremely fragile state and yet they continue to hound me with box after box after box after box after box!
It is a disgusting habit, Bertie.  It should be discouraged.
It is quite late enough.
Aye, do.
Yes.  I do.
Is that the Queen's request?
A man can refuse only so many invitations from his Queen.  It was remiss of me not to come earlier.
Quite.
I don't think about it.
I'm not married.
I do what I do.
She trusts you, John.
No love.
But others will know that you acted for the greater good.
Aye, ma'am.
And I intend to be there when she's ready.
It's a fine spot, ma'am.
Just say what you have to say, woman. What other people think shouldn't matter to you.
What Mr Ponsonby was appreciating was their literary merit, a skill not intimately associated with the knowledge of grooming.  Literary appreciation does not begin and end with Tennyson.
I hope they didn't go to any trouble, John.
The Queen forbids it.  I cannot allow it because I cannot live without you.  Without you, I cannot find the strength to be who I must be.  Please.
Indeed, and for that they are eternally grateful.
In so many ways ... and yet it is your presence they crave.  A figurehead.
So?
It's questionable whether there's any advantage to be had from that direction.  She's never been less popular.
Not too protracted, I hope.
Dear oh dear.
No, indeed.
I will not tolerate anybody lecturing me about the responsibility of the monarchy....
Just them?
I made no request to go out riding today.  How long has he been there?
Mr Brown is unable to attend today.
I believe he is unwell, ma'am.
I understand he was in a fight.
Again?
I have no idea.
I -- forgive me, ma'am, I am no wiser than yourself.
They are demanding the dismissal of John Brown on grounds of drunkeness.
It's a tough game.  Hard to pin that bastard down.  Keeps on changing the rules.
And maybe you've been taking too many drugs.
He's probably outside.  You know how he is. Gets bored...
We are talking...
How?!  It's a machine, Alex. Machine's don't think.  They're not alive.  It's a good program, a brilliant program, it was designed so it would act as if it were alive, but it's not alive.
Call the others.  Laurie, Benz...
It's the middle of the night.  They're asleep.  Phone didn't wake them.
It's two o'clock in the morning.  Go home. Go to sleep.  We'll figure something out in the morning.
We can't...
What?
Like the fractals?
...but then it hits the relay stations...
I don't know.
What?
Everything.
You didn't hear me?
Yes I am...
And what if something happens to you? Am I suppose to go in after you alone?!
What?
Yeah, that's what worries me.
There never is.
Hold my keys, then.
Yes...
Then we'll go home.
That way.
In this world, wrong is right!
Yes...but...how did you...
Give her a chance, will you?
What's going on, Cynthia?
I'm going home Cynthia.
Yeah.
Whatever.
That a man's attitude determines to a large extent how his life will be.
Well, Sir, I'm afraid they said you're overdrawn at your bank and your line of credit has been cancelled.
Honey, all the great ones came through here at one time or another.
Now I guess you and your Aunt have an understanding. So here's the key and you need anything, just give a holler.  Everybody in this building's pretty much okay with me or they wouldn't be here. If you want, later I'll introduce you around. No hard feelings if you don't, and don't forget the rooftop garden. It's just up the stairs we passed. It's open to all the tenants. You can see the Hollywood sign from there.
You got it! See you later honey.
It's just for a night or two, until she finds her own place. I tried to explain that to Aunt Ruth, but the connection was bad and her plane was leaving and she got it all mixed up. I kept telling her it was my friend and she kept saying she didn't know any Ritas ...
Don't make me out to be a sucker. Louise Bonner says there's trouble in there. You remember last night. Sometimes she's wrong, but if there is trouble - get rid of it.
Well. Shall we get to it? Would you like a water or a coffee before we begin?
What?
Yeah ... Betty. You don't rush it. I don't rush it. We play it close, just like in the movies.
May I have your name please?
But it said #12.
Unh, unh.
Maybe that's where the accident was. There must be a police report. We could call.
I'm not sure about this.
Good luck!
Okay.
But I don't know, Sol. I never heard of Sol. I'd just get in trouble. That's why we shouldn't go see about Diane Selwyn... it's better not to get in trouble.
C'mon help me in. I'll open the front door.
And do we know which of the fifty-seven buildings Wally Brown is in?
Nothing... I don't like being out in the open like this.
Go ahead.
It was just a thing. The story made you laugh.
Not a coke or anything?
Great.. great. Is there any kind of hint or anything ?
Jesus, my legs are asleep. I'll never be able to win this shit.
I have an embezzler and his accomplice.
You're both embezzling. I saw the records.
I don't know.
What ?
Look I don't even wanna know how I got in this mess. I just want out. It has nothing to do with me.
I'M NOT BOFFING MATTHEW !
NO ! I wouldn't do that.
We drown.
I'd say about thirty to forty minutes. Give or take a few.
Excuse me ?
I just graduated from M.I.T. in engineering. That's when John McCay hired me.
So you may have been duped this whole time. Killing innocent people, that must make you feel ..., how does it feel ?
Yeah, everyone has to when they get hired.
Know what ? That it was your fault ?
It'll end. It'll end with him and McCay. Then the park shuts down. Permanently.
I work here, remember ?
Well, I'll see you at the next staff party.
Yes, can I help you ? Maybe a donut or something ?
Who are you anyway ? What the hell is this ?
Are you hunting wabbits ?
You were one of those guys that played Dungeons & Dragons with real swords, weren't you.
Yeah, we're about a hundred an fifty feet below the subway stations. We're heading a little higher up now.
What ? Are you my mother ?
You've got to be kidding me ! His lazy ass couldn't win the special Olympics.
For once in your life, shut the fuck up.
Fire the whole division. We're moving more of the operations division into Manhattan anyway. Whoever is left over from the conversion is no longer needed. We already have all the key people here. Anyone else is expendable.
I am thirty two.
John, sir.
Sir ?
We have new "guests" for the park. I have a file on them. May I see Bruce ?
No I am not.
Just a temp who pissed me off and a girl who turned me down for the night of her life.
You're paying the bills.
The room will fill to the top, then if they wind up in the next room, they lived, if not, they're dead.
He's got two chices.either it's the Bowling Alley from Hell or Alice in Murderland. See this ? Even Bruce knows that no one can make it out of here in one piece.
How can this happen ?
I've never heard the Flintstones reduced to a sexual exploitation quite like that. You're funny.
Like what, a Porsche ? A Ferrari ?
Wake up, we're in trouble.
Fine, fine, I feel like a chicken McNugget.
Maybe all that testosterone plugs his ears.
We made it !
I want to go to sleep for about a month.
Hey buddy. You okay ?
I disagree. I think we should start looking into the severance pay schedules and make sure the people with families can.....
I was drinking a little in those days.  I'm drinking a little these days too.
I'm not supposed to talk to strangers, not even nuns.
Well if I was looking for a victim, I definitely wouldn't pick your Uncle Phil who outweighs me by about 150 pounds, besides, who would I ask for ransom? You??
Don't mention it.
Me, I'll know!
Pommeroy.
Well the thing is your room is right next door to ours, and so we thought, well, I thought, if you were willing we might move you to Grammoo's room, and use your old room for the nursery. See we're gonna be up half the night with a newborn and there'll be a lot of noise....
No it's okay, I understand, really.
Seriously?
What boy likes you?
Okay, we need wallpaper paste.  Hey Cece!
Of course.
And no boys, promise me, oh those LA people are all so corrupt you'll end up pregnant and on drugs...and don't come running to me when you wake up in the city morgue with a tag on your toe having been beaten up into an unrecognizable pulp by some surfer...and DON'T make eye contact, it communicates an implied vulnerability.
It means...I'm a paranoid nitwit who's never let his baby girl out of his sight for the simple reason he's a paranoid nitwit. So why don't you just say &quot;Oh Dad&quot; and get on the damn plane already?
Thanks, I needed that.
Have fun.
Listen, if a boy wants to do homework with you, it really means he didn't have nerve to ask you out on a date, so you'll get your homework together and pretend to be studying, and the next thing you know you're ordering pizza and talking about your favorite movie stars.
Phil's moving to LA, Grammoo's passing, the baby being born, Vada's report, I think...
Maggie Muldovan? Did you...know her?
I'm sorry, it's just...I've been taking all these seminars to get in touch with my feelings and...sometimes it gets out of hand.
Oh.  Ohhh?
Ummmmm, look, I...I...
Does she?
You are?

I'll try.
Well...
It's just a corpse.
Neither can mine. She's dead. It's Shelly who's pregnant.
It's Kevin, I don't want him to see me.
Oh God, he's coming over here, act natural, totally natural.
Boys always pretend they hate you when they really like you.
I don't know. And I don't care, Kevin's a jerk and I don't like him anymore. He's all yours!
Well...I'm not supposed to talk about it, but since I'm gonna write about it I might as well tell you. She was a spy against the Russians.
No-one invented gravity, it just exists.
That's simple. She was pregnant with me...when she went to Russia and she didn't know...and then when the Russians found out, they waited to shoot her 'cause you're not allowed to kill pregnant women anywhere in the world.
I'm Sam Helburn. Sam.
It's no problem, I had a mother once myself.
O.K. Thank you very much.
If you're selling Girl Scout cookies I'm borderline diabetic.
The poem is really about attitude. It's about not giving up and...it's easy to be overwhelmed sometimes but...that's when we should...force ourselves to push on.
My mother.
Great, I have so much to say, I hardly know where to start.
MOM!
And you're gonna solve the mystery?
I wasn't eavesdropping, I was overhearing.
Excuse me, pardon, thank you, excuse me.
What difference does it make?
Yearbooks always set you out for disappointment, I want mine to say: Nick probably won't amount to much, so don't be surprised if you never hear anything about him again. Can we go?...It smells like someone left their gym bag in here.
You would.
He is one of the great poets.
Oh, no wait, I like that you bought me here.
Well, it doesn't open cans or anything but it...it's sort of a reminder of a friend of mine.
Well he was a boy, he was my friend...he was my best friend. When we were kids we were gonna...move out here and move to the Brady Bunch.
In the tar??
Big deal.
But we wouldn't really be related right?
Good. I mean...
He's an undertaker.
You better ace it...you sacrificed our whole vacation.
Some sacrifices are worth it.
Well I know you're not crazy about taking Vada around tomorrow, so...I just want you to know I appreciate it though.
Well, wha...what kind of arrangement?
Committed.
Vada, I know that traditionally you're not supposed to do a lot of these things before you're officially married...but these are very, very special circumstances.
Bye.
I don't know, he's got an awful lot on his mind right now.
You want me to come with?
Dad already gave me this lecture. He's gonna meet me at the airport, then we'll go for some pizza, then we'll have dinner in bed with Shelly.
He wasn't touching me he was just...gesturing...
Oh, Hi, how's the investigation going?
You know exactly...what kind it is. Come on Rose...what do you want from me?
I'll be here.
Well maybe for you.
You couldn't?
When did you umm, I mean umm...
Why do they call them training bra's? It's not like learning to ride a bike.
No. You know they say, that it never rains, that you can barbecue on Christmas day...instead of riding your bike, you just surf over to your friends house. Oh, and the place is just crawling with celebrities. I know someone who saw Walter Matthau picking up his dry-cleaning.
Everybody did, walk along Citrus between Fountain and Sunset any afternoon.
Good for you baby.
I'm impressed.
No.
Vada, what's wrong sweetheart?
Oh, wait relax now, let me look, let me look, come up here and we'll have a look.
I think it's still available.
Great, you can start right away. Call me Harry. Now, umm, is this what you'd normally wear for work? Don't get me wrong, I like it, very much, but the....
This was the Reverend Porter's wife, you have her looking like a two dollar hooker.
That wasn't an image. She WAS an old school Marm.  Fix it.
Oh that, she just likes to play.
She was raised in a funeral home, she knows a thing or two about it.
I shouldn't stick my nose in other people's business. It's just that I like Vada, very much.
I wrote that.
Oh, how do you mean?
Did she ever see Vada?
Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?
Honestly Harry, he got the mustang, I promise.....
I know that, but what do you want from me?
Ya, that rack holds six ties.
Last month you wanted to play the violin. Then you wanted to be a ventriloquist.
Why?
Ahh, Vada, just put anything you want in the cart, anything at all.  I don't know what's gotten into her today.
In a minute, look it's hot, sweetie you'll burn your nose, look out.
Yes, I did, very much for a long time, and even now, I get a little sad when I think of a pretty flower or a sunset that your mother would have liked.
That's good, memories are good sweetheart. Vada, I'm sorry; I was trying to keep it from you, I just couldn't. You're a good girl, and I want you to be happy; don't be an old grump like me.  Seeya in the morning.
I'm very nervous.
Are you sure about all this?
Oh, I'm running late. Shelly'll be here any minute.
Oh, I'm Judy, I go to school with her, I wanted to tell her I'm sorry about Thomas J.
Thank you. Bye.
Yes, and now I'm reading War &amp; Peace for fun.
Thirty five dollars.
Do you think she is?
Yes I do, and I think she's very good for your father.
I am.
It's a mood ring, it tells what mood I'm in.
Well you don't know that. Ask him.
No, I'm divorced.
You don't have to wait, daddy'll be mad if you're late.
No.
A girl's always gotta look her best.
They'll come around. Close your eyes, I wanna bring out the gorgeous color in them. The first rule in applying eye makeup, is you can never wear enough blue eye shadow.
Uh huh, why?
NO!, He's fine.  Fish are very resilient animals you know. Don't worry, I won't get another fish.
I'll pay it back, besides, I don't think i'll ever go to class again.
That was Grammoo's. It's a phrenology chart, they used to study the bumps in your head to see if you had a good personality or not. Come here, i'll diagnose your head.
Come on, it's fun.
It doesn't matter, 'cause they're not regular horses, they got wings, and it's no big deal if you fall, you just land in cloud.
We're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch.
I am running faster!!
Hi, wanna ride bikes?
I wanna live with them too.
He likes her better than me.
Leave then, some friend you are.
Hi Vada, can you come out?
No.
But then I won't be able to see anything.
Okay, okay.
Umm, Ummmmm
Well, let's spit on it.
Okay, seeya.  Vada?
Would you think of me?
I've adjusted, and thanks for asking.
The wandering sportswriter.
He says, "Swear.  When we're both 28, if we've never been married... we marry each other!"
Desperate.  To talk.
I can see why.
Go figure you.
I wish.
It's too late to start over.
Tell him you've loved him for nine years, but you were afraid to realize it.
So your honeymoon is exactly where?
Do you get hysterical in small confined spa...
Probably am.  Forget I brought it up.
... whatever is manly and independent.
Exactly.
Only.  If he wants to.
They'll eat it anyway, you ever been to a walk?
... well, maybe it works on fingers, too.
Actually, it all starts tomorrow. It's one of those four-day weddings, with all the traditional events, and ten million people flying in from Madagascar such.
Dance?  You don't dance!  You learn to dance??
First girl I ever knew.  Who lets me give her a bath.
Hey, cabs are expensive.  I'm cheap, remember?
She would never.  Never.  Even think of that.
That would be a girl.  I don't even know.
Michael!!
Like I said, dazzling.
It's more than that.
You've been the man in mine.
I mean, you commit to a wedding. And then it seems like... this... momentum, you know?  You forget you... chose it.
The night we met.
Well.
If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento...
... wrote it, yeah.  I'm the bad guy.
Lower.
... me, yeah.  And she likes Tommy Lasorda.  Case closed.
No, it's, uh... a real big favor.
Like family, huh?
To him.
Well, if that's the way you f...
With those big, dark, haunted eyes. As if you were harborin' some... unspeakably... guilty... secret.
Oh the way out of the crab house? We asked Michael if we could see the ring?
Well, that just happened that time.
You got a real good memory, Star.
What do you have to buy?
Is there food?
Don't feel that way, honey.
Go to the King Of the Road and thank her.
I'm really all right, Barnett. Don't you worry really... I just don't want you to leave me that's all.
Eater  says she doesn't see how you do it.
Green.
Thank you-- Yes, I am.
Oh, sure.
Okay. Thanks.
How is that?
His word? Are you telling me Haven promised you something?
Third party?
What does he want?
Stop it!
When is it?
Where the hell have you been?
National?
Your brother?
What is a turkey shoot.
No. Mr. Green, I don't know how to tell you this -- your wire passed away -- I thought they'd called you at home.
I think we can do that. Come in.
Oh... a little of both. Just thought I'd look around at Nashville for a while.
I'1l get your bag.
Maybe you can look after me a little.
Replacement party.
He doesn1t have fungus, does he?
Does their hair fall out?
But, I'll take some of that Nyquil... you know it puts you right to sleep no matter what's wrong, you go right off...
Yes, it is --
He's a member of our congregation.
Well, I met you that afternoon in the control room and we...
End of Church Street. Next to a grocery store.
I have to go. He sighs.
That's what you said before.
Oh.
Hundreds of times.
Hello.
For him?
You're doing some recording here, aren't you?
What!
Do they have a show to give it to you?
Just a minute.
What?
No, we never did that
I'll be dammed.
Well, you just remember, if you can't kick front, kick back, 'cause at least you're kicking... Ten minutes, okay?
You think I got any kind of a voice?
Is that good?
You think I should take lessons?
Well, honey, I sure hope it comes your way then.
Yes, they were.
What...
Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime.
The key lime is great, but it's an acquired taste.
Are we in a big hurry?
Don't stop!
Susanville, Soledade.
How's it goin'?
I've never wounded anything in my life. I got you locked right between the eyes.
Let's do it.
Aside from the obvious?
Then was it worth it?
Excuse me, did you say an instant of purity? What was the instant of purity? The bodies you left behind on your bloody trail?
Please explain to me, Mickey, where's the purity that you couldn't live without in five year old Danny Millhouse's blown off head? Where's the purity in forty-eight people who are no longer on this planet because they met you and Mallory? What's so fucking pure about that?
You'll never understand. Me and you, Wayne, we're not even the same species. I used to be you...then I evolved. From where you're standing, you're a man. From where I'm standing, you're a ape. I'm here...I'm right here... and you...you're somewhere else, man. You say why? I say why not?
I'm sure we will.
When have they ever been right?
Are you kidding? The Golden Globe, The Edward R. Murrow award...
Got it.
So, what now?
No. Not really.
Unfortunately, yes.
I do, too.
Have you seen 'Pumping Iron?'
They were especially influenced by 'Conquering Huns of Neptune.'
That's my opinion.
What's the big deal? Take out my chocolate cream filled, put one of these roasted coconut---
So you're giving a man who butchers whole families, little babies included, my chocolate cream filled?
Rockin'!
Well, Mickey and Mallory can't be together. So, we'll put you on one of our prison busses and you'll take Mallory first, then you'll come back for Mickey.
Super cool.  This is great stuff. How ya doin'?
How so?
Now, Phil, I don't know if you've ever been on a set before---
Mr. Wurlitzer, I assure you, I am very familiar with Mickey Knox's career.
I can't do that. Five guys.
I'll cut it in half. Four guys, but that's it.
Now, if you want to work like a real nigger, you can always go out and chop cotton.
That dyin's gonna be done two ways.
I still don't know what you're talkin' about.
Used to be. On the railroad.
Don't start no trouble, boy!
I'll smile when it's funny.
Would you like me to say anything tomorrow?
I don't know. Forty-eight, I guess.
That ain't my idea of friendliness.
Okay.
Oh yeah? That's my home town.
No. Never had much use for hell-howlers. You goin'?
What d'you expect?
Don't Duff--
Well, either we're gonna hit the hay or get married. Now you don't want to hit the hay, and I don' want to get married.
No.
What d'you mean?
Are you married?
What?
Look, baby - I don't know 'bout you, but it's the right thing for me. I just know it is. So, what d'you say?
He could live with us.
Smells like something crawled in there and died.
Duff - you know those women you used to know--
You still didn't answer my question.
Uh-huh. Why?
They won't.
Don't ask, baby - huh!  How much money you got with you?
Water pump's busted. I don't know if it's worth fixin', but I need that car.
Yeah!
'You kiddin'? You ain't goin' to no white home. I seen the way they look at you when you go down the street.
Watch out!
Well, that don't do me one bit of good!
There's nothing to say.
Like what?
You gonna sit at home the rest of your life? Jesus!
What 'you signifyin'?
Yeah, see you in hell.
What's eatin' you, Jocko?
Wouldn't have known you.
Okay.
'Don't sound so sure.
That's right.
Okay.
Okay.
She don't look no worse to me.
Thank you.
How come you all ain't sendin' them to the same school?
Don't look like there's a right way.
'Musta knocked her up.
What d'you know about women, Pop?
Hi.
Your mother used to lay for her boss, boy. Did you know that?
Okay, so what's a girl supposed to do? Me not workin' and her cleanin' house for a white man. I'm tellin' you, boy, keep away from marriage. Ya gotta stay light on your feet or you won't make it.
If you don't quit it, Will, I'm leaving.
Okay, boy, beat it.
Omar, listen to me--
Since when?
Bathroom. But he's nowhere near it.
My man's coming to get my ass out of here. That's good enough for me.
She was prettier before she tarted herself up with the hardware.
The Elders, mon...
Skeleton key. This opens the gates of Babylon.
No. Just Riviera trying to fuck with our heads. They're close. Very close.
We'll match your rate just prior to your... accident. One half in advance.
Then we rendezvous with the final member of our team. For now, that's all you need to know.
I cannot tell a lie. Sorry.
You'll be linked during the entire operation.
He's a Sense/Net Chairman. Why would he launch an A.I.?
The old man cheats on his wife with her own clone?
What are you talking about?
I find out now.
The words?
Fine, Ratz. Thanks.
I don't have a girl.
Fine, Dixie. Fine.
Yeah. That was me.
We got problems topside.
I'll let it access me. That'll give you a free shot. Make it a good one. Dix.
Less than thirty minutes.
I said, it's coming. Just get me in, man.
What?
I thought you already left.
People are talking. They say the Yakuza has a contract out on you.
Too many places. You're playing tag wish some kind of death wish, Case.  I'm sorry but I'm not sticking around for the funeral.
There's no call for violence. I've simply accessed your memory for a spokesperson. You use that gun and it will only create another inconvenient interruption. You see, you've been avoiding me, Case.
And Linda...
I think you're full of shit.
I'll give it my best shot, mother fucker.
Since Armitage sold them a program on it. Put them years ahead of the competition.
Couple of months.
For someone else. Bodyguard. Courier... Whatever.
We'll find out soon enough. If you don't pull the splices out.
Couple of days. They'll examine you.
What is it with you? Why is it so important? It's a buzz, right? Like getting high.
So you're a wire junkie.
A regular Fagan.
Give me five minutes.
Yeah... Yeah, I'm fine.
Something exotic I hope.
...And if I guess wrong?
Or a little self-indulgent to say the least.
Hold on.
Shut up.
Well, do you?
Nice.
Oh I know.
Thanks.
What about the "Roaring Twenties" or "The 80's"?
Roger in Op/Ed.
I swear to God, Jos. When is the last time you went on a real live date?
I've kissed guys. I've just never kissed a guy. Felt that thing--
And Gus - when you picked up knitting, who showed you how to hold the needles?
The girls threw them at me in the locker room.
Very romantic.
'Nita, this is about reporting, not accessorizing.
Yeah, but I'm okay. I've got some work to do.
No, thanks--I'm doing this on my own.
Her dad sold a car to Leonardo Di Caprio's uncle and before he picked it up, her dad let us all sit in it and take pictures.
Umm- I don't think you're supposed to wear white jeans after 1983.
Rosalind and Orlando.  From "As You Like It"?  Shakespeare?
Every Tom, Dick, and Harry thinks he can write. But a journalist gets in there, right where the bombs are. He's aggressive. Grabs the bull by the balls.
But I don't want it straightened out.
Have you been to any parties?
I bet Good Housekeeping would go gaga over the cole slaw piece.
Dude, you rock!
Wow. That's big. I mean sex is a really big deal. You shouldn't do it until you know you've found the right person.
But I'm not a penguin.
She just needs a new windshield wiper.
Oh yay! And then I could be as happy as you!
I can't do this.
Is that true?
Better than I...
This is it Jos! This is my ninth inning! The game isn't over--I just thought it was!  I get on the Southglen baseball team, the right scout sees me-- I'm into the minors- it's game time!
I-
Not the happiest of souls.  "Art is a form of catharsis, and love is a permanent flop."
College. Haven't really thought about it.
I don't have to say that.
Why do you do that?
But Humpty Dumpty was alone.
That's really what we all need, right? Someone to sit up on the wall with us--
What! But--I wasn't even going to go to college--
Thanks. So do you.
Well, are you here with anybody?
I don't! Look, you could get to know me, again.
I finally found my story.
Who are you guys?
You so do not deserve to be prom queen.
Lock.
<i>                      Now in the box, we'll wait and hide Until his curiosity Entices him to look inside...</i>
<i>                      Jack said we should work together.</i>
No!
I'm grown up now.  I have to leave some time.
No.
I'm not hungry.  What's wrong?  I spent all morning on that soup.  I thought you liked Worm's Wart.
Can't you make other creations?
<i>                      -- A box? --        Is it steel? --                     Are there locks? -- Is it filled with a pox? --                          A pox! -- How delightful, a pox!</i>

It's getting there.
Who's Lisa?
And you don't know anything about a murder across the street and a crazy girl who lived here - who saw the whole thing?
I wasn't sure, Ken...
Oh, please...
Jesse's dead!  I sliced 'im real good!
What the hell are you talking about?
Yeah, well, Schneider's got a stick up his ass today.
I'm sorry...
How come?
Look at this car.  Are you kidding?
That's okay, I wanted to.
Wow...
World History.  But, I'll see you in the morning, right?
About what?
Whoa!
Why won't you talk to me?
he's just waiting to take me.  When I sleep.
I can't!
Hi.
Huh?
No.  I'm okay.
We're gonna stay out of your way tomorrow night.
We're going to bed.
Thanks, Mom.
They've gotten worse since I took away her credit cards.
The maid packed a suitcase.  Teresa!  Teresa?
It's okay, I'm not tired.  Really.
That's right.  I don't.
Morning, Doctor Goldman.
YOU'RE HOT STIT WITH A LITTLE MUTE KID -- LET'S SEE YOU TAKE A PIECE OF ME!  KRUEGER!
When I was a little girl.  Three or four. If I had a nightmare, I'd bring my Dad in. The dream would always get better.  He always used to tell me about it the next day -- he used to think they were his dreams. NANCY When did it stop?
How do we find him, Kristen?
They sedated me.  We're stuck here till it wears off.
I'm so proud of you all.  Tell Neil I...
So?
But I couldn't go until I told you how sorry I am for all the things I've done.
What's that supposed to mean?
So I've been told.  Practically an obsession of your.
Never been here before?
Anything?
There's nothing we can do.  It's out of our hands.
Assuming your mysterious nun in right.
There's only one man...and its time for him to talk.
No...
What about Kristen?
How do we get in?
Cooling down.
There will be no repeat occurences of last night's events.  From now on, your doors will be locked during sleeping hours.  We'll begin a policy of evening sedation.  For everybody.
Accident my ass.  I thought this was supposed to be straight talk in here.
I said I'm not listening -- and I think, looking at something that firm, you and your droopy little excuse for an 'arse' would be well-advised to keep quiet.
Who was that rather difficult chap you were talking to on the way up?
Eighteen yards.  That's my house there.
No.
Oh -- Okay.
No, it's a stupid privacy thing.  I always choose a cartoon character -- last time out, I was Mrs. Bambi.
Ahm -- well -- we would have liked to -- but it was difficult, obviously, being set in space.
Well, I've been on a diet since I was nineteen, which means basically I've been hungry for a decade.  I've had a sequence of not nice boyfriends -- one of whom hit me: and every time my heart gets broken it gets splashed across the newspapers as entertainment. Meantime, it cost millions to get me looking like this...
Let's go in.
Yes, you did.
There's no 'unless.'  No one has said "whoopsidaisies" for fifty years and even then it was only little girls with blonde ringlets.
Step aside.
She left me.
You've got to go.
Because my boyfriend, who I thought was in America, is in fact in the next room.
This is the place.
Damn.  'And Wainwright...'
My son's name is Johnny?
I do.  It feels like how being in love should be.  Floating through a dark blue sky.
You have a stunt bottom?
The ice cream or Mel Gibson's bottom?
Well, thank you.  Anyway -- time for bed.  Or... sofa-bed.
You and every person in this country.
No seriously.  I mean, they're just breasts.  Every second person in the world has got them...
But... they're odd-looking.  They're for milk.  Your mum's got them.  You must have seen a thousand of them -- what's the fuss about?
I know, I know -- but... just -- let's stay calm...
I mean -- today's newspapers will be lining tomorrow's waste paper bins.
I only found out you were here yesterday.
Absolutely -- you're clearly very busy.
Okay.
Yes -- I'm sorry -- I had to leave... I didn't want to disturb you.
Thank you.  Shall I...
You expect me to tell the truth about my life to the most indiscreet man in England?
Well, no -- I'm sure he was friendly -- to Demi Moore -- who acted with him in 'Ghost.'
Miracles do happen.
Right.
Why not -- all that awaits me at home is a masturbating Welshman.
Tony -- what do you think?
What?
Hello, Anna.  Delighted to meet you.
Shame!
No -- it's my 22nd.
Di Caprio.
It was good.
Hun -- this is Anna.  Anna -- this is Honey -- she's my baby sitter.
Blimey.  What's that?
Well, thanks, that's great.
This is Henry James film?
Any bit in particular?
But Ringo Starr doesn't look anything like Topol.
Martin, can't you just deal with this yourself?
Can you tell her I'll ring her back.
That is a cheap question and the answer is, of course, no comment.
No, it doesn't.
I think you do, yes.
But I wish to make it clear I've turned a corner and henceforward intend to be impressively happy.
No, don't think I do.
So not over her, in fact.
Or Bambi... or, I don't know, Beavis or Butthead?
Ahm -- combination of factors really. No clean clothes...
Right.  Vicious circle.  And then I was like rooting around in your things, and found this, and I thought -- cool. Kind of spacey.
So -- any messages?
Absolutely not.
Does 'Flintstone' mean anything to you?
Right.  Right.  You think it's the wrong moment.  Fair enough.  Do you mind if I have a go?
Why not?
Yes.
Okay -- what if I did have a book down my trousers?
I mean, the other day you made an allusion to my wife and the possible sexual problems we might be having. I know that to be the case, but the way in which you broached it, if that's your idea of teaching me something...
Is it true McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped yesterday?
I-I-I...
I don't want your mother to believe something like this but what am I to think?
Mister Washington.
Yes, ma'am.
Yes. Now go along, Mister McMurphy. Go along.
Sorry, ma'am.
That music is for everyone, Mister McMurphy.
Mister McMurphy, there are old men here who couldn't hear the music at all if it were lower. That music is all they have, and I wish you wouldn't lean against the glass there, your hands are staining the window.
Not at all, Mister McMurphy...
Well, say. How 'bout springing a pack of cigarettes loose?
Go on...
Just a minute, Mister McMurphy!
No way.
A vote is before the group.
But there are eighteen patients on the ward, Mister McMurphy.
Thank you, ma'am.
B-B-Billy.
O-o-o-oh...
Just fine, Billy boy, just fine. Full of piss an' vinegar! They checked my plugs and cleaned my points...
M-M-M-Mack?
Thank you.
Ca-na-da...
Yeah...
Wow! They're so quiet.
That okay. I'll take your marker. How many ya want?
Yeah, Mack, what is it?
Hey, what's that?
Come here a minute, Cheswick. You, too, Sefelt. Hey, all you guys, come over here, I wanna show you somethin'.
Tell 'er to go straight to hell!
Huh?
Lobotomy?
Now, what would I be trying to say?
I don't see you scoring any points, buddy. And you're just the man for the job, right?
A baseball game isn't worth the risk, my friend.
You mean you're going to try to pick that thing up and shove it through the window?
I know, goddammit! You don't have ta tell me that!
I just started!
No!
Gary Blinker...
Hit me.
Wait a minute, Martini, I can't hear a thing.  What?
I saw 'em! I saw 'em.
What is it?
In what way?
Well, you're here for a ninety-day observation period, Mister McMurphy. I'd like you to understand you are here on a court order and we are responsible to the state. So, I'd like your cooperation!
Good. Good.
We'll let you know.
Stay back! Patients aren't allowed to enter the... Oh, stay back!
Look, miss, I don't like swallowing something without knowing what it is!
'Kay, Mac!
Are you a doctor?
Because I quit breathing.
Yeah, yeah, you're a fucking phony, McMurphy!
You're on.  Let's go! An' keep it quiet.
I don't believe it...
Breakfast! Hell, I know just the place where we can chow down an' thaw out before we shoot back on home. 'Kay?
Sure...
Gimme those dice. I'll blow this board to pieces. Here we go...  Lebenty leben, count me over eleven, Martini...
Okay. Who else?
Martini out!
Prayin', brother. Prayin'.
I tell ya, there's an angel of mercy standing out there, Turkle.
You's better believe it, brother!
Fine, thank you.  Here, please take these.
To help you relax... please...
No...
Oh, yeah...
Hi ya, big boy? How's it goin'? Like it in here?
Huh?
Jus' playin' the game, sucker...
No way...
Shhh... let's move it away from the window...
Are they dangerous when they're awake?
Yeah, well, I'll tell ya somethin'. I'll tell ya somethin'. I had this boyfriend, Chuck.  Ya know him, Mac. Ya remember, Chuck.
I thought so.
He's dead.
Oh, yeah...
Don't you sweet talk me you ol' spook, you!
Yes, but...  He was having an affair.
I-- I must've misplaced it.
It was late in arriving.  But it's here now.
Once they pay the bill, we don't usually follow them.
I feel like I've been wandering in the desert for as long as I can remember.  With nothing but emptiness around me, wind and sun...  And suddenly, out of the blue, somehow I've found the oasis.
Dwayne?
Ask her if she knows how I might reach him?  If she has a telephone number?
Hi there...
Thanks.
Amazing.
Dwayne Pinsley?  I'm trying to reach Dwayne Pinsley.
Well, he'd have to hurry.  My flight leaves at four o'clock.
I know I'm limping.  I stubbed my toe.
What?
Because-- I want you to be happy.
Just to that place down at the bottom of the stairs.  Nothing fancy.
Actually, I think I prefer Katherine Hepburn.
Yeah.
Hi.  Are you... busy?
I know the feeling.
No one had to tell me.  He's starring in the local play.
No, it isn't.  I called off my wedding all because of you.
Yes.
That's not the point.  And what if I had wanted to?
There is no us.
Just since yesterday.
Okay.  Good.  See you then, then.
Oh, hello.
Yeah.  He's around somewhere.
Oh.
So, what's your point?
I don't know, Kate.
I know.  You're right.
Because you were afraid to fly.
How hard can it be?  I'll land there, I'll go to his hotel, I'll introduce myself, and--
Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned?
A rich, possibly fat, slob.
Nothing.
Well, you don't have to get snippy with me.
I don't know.  I just asked her if she knew him and all of the sudden--
You've travelled over six thousand miles and now you're gonna play hard to get?
Okay, okay.  You join him.  But first will you ask if he's here?
Oh my God.  Where?
What?
Like a detective.
The last dead end in a long series of dead ends that I am relieved to finally be leaving behind.  May as well start packing, our cab's gonna be here in an hour.
My God... you're right.
Uh huh...  Okay, we'll be there. How is he, anyway?
So.  I guess I've got a wedding to go to.
You used to love it when I called you doll.
What?  You know him?
It was a harmless little prank. Who in the world would've thought she'd spend her life waiting for this guy?
I can't tell her.  She's called off her wedding.  She'll never speak to me again.
She said she knew where to find him, and then she grabbed my car keys, and--
Good strategy.
Aren't you gonna go introduce yourself?
Thanks.
He just got a call from "Mr. Upstairs." Something's gone wrong. He's plenty hot.
You know Johnny when he gets mad.
If I talk too loud it's the fault of the nuns.
Why should he forget it?
In a minute.
I've got to cover a bet there on the way over. Anyway, it gives us a chance to talk.
The grapevine says you picked up a subpoena.
Sure, that's all right when you're a kid, but you'll be pushing thirty pretty soon, slugger. It's time you got some ambition.
Maybe.
Boss loader!
I don't know I don't know! I tell you I ain't made up my mind yet. That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
I could have been better!
Charley... . Charley... . Wow... .
I wish I knew, Edie, But
Terry... Terry... .
None of your business.
Thanks.  Steel pipes and baseball bats.
I'll get home all right now.
You training to be a nun or something?
Looked like two pieces of rope. And your teeth were
Man, you were a mess!
Pardon me while I reach for my beads.
You don't mind yourself at all, do you.  Joey used to race pigeons.
Describing you. A square from out there. I mean you're nowhere.  Miss Four Corners.
I had to scrap all my life. Figured I might as well get paid for it. When I was a kid my old man got killednever mind how. Charley and I was put in a placethey called it a Children's Home. Some home! I run away and peddled papers, fought in club smokers and  But what am I runnin' off at the mouth for? What do you care?
What a fruitcake you are!
Want to hear my philosophy? Do it to him before he does it to you.
I thought I felt mean tonight. But I'm not I'm just all mixed up... .
Look out for number one. Always number one.  I should've known you wouldn't tell me. Pop said Johnny Friendly used to own you. I think he still owns you.  No wonder everybody calls you a bum.
Terry, what's wrong?
Lucky Pop isn't home, he'd kill you.
It's you who's being hurt. By keeping it inside you, like a poison. Sooner or later it's got to come out.
I never mentioned the word before. In his agony he grips a glass standing on the night table.
Do what I told you. Take care of Charley.
I thought you might want some hot coffee.
Who is he, Pop?
Someone else c'n take your confession.
Edie. The Commission. Your subpoena. I know you got a subpoena.
Ball games! Don't break my heart! I wouldn't care if he gave you a life pass to the Polo Grounds. So you got a brother. Well, let me tell you something you got some other brothers and they're all getting the short end while your cousin Johnny gets mustard on his face at the Polo Grounds. If I was you   Listen, I'm not asking you to do anything, Terry. It's your own conscience that's got to do the asking.
What do you want from me, Father.
You go to hell.
A bum. Look what you're doing. You want to be brave? Firing lead into another man's flesh isn't brave. Any bum who picks up a .45 in a pawn shop can be that brave. You want to hurt Johnny Friendly? You want to fix him for what he did to Charley and a dozen men who were better than Charley? Don't fight him like a hoodlum down here in the jungle. That's just what he wants. He'll hit you in the head and plead self-defense. Fight him tomorrow in the courtroom with the truth as you know it  Truth is the gun Drop that thing and tell the truth a more dangerous weapon than this little   cap pistol.
Johnny Friendly is layin' odds that you won't get up.
I can? Okay.  Okay...
Have a seat. I'm trying to find out just what happened to Joey Doyle. Maybe you can help.
What about it?
Looking for me?
But I ain't out. I'm in. I'm in. Who's lying to who?
No.
Hey look-
It was a big nothing! The Father did all the talking.
How'd you get that.
You want to know somethin'?
Go on talkin'. You're talkin' yourself right into the river. Go on, go on... .
I can't believe it a small fortune.   You can't buy me you're still a bum!  'Bye, Edie. Lord have mercy on Joey.
You wouldn't understand.  Seeing a cemetery on a night like this can stir in the mind the best ideas for a good horror story.
Sure there are--and I've tried them all.  Plays, love stories, westerns, dog stories.  Huh, now there was a good one, that dog story all about--
Where?
Then..then what's that music?
Be careful!--They'll see you.
You've got a right to be. We're trapped by a bunch of fiends.
I don't know.  I just don't know. But don't give up. We're not finished yet.
What can we do against them?
Maybe so.
There's nothing to forgive. It was all a dream.
It would seem so, Master
For what!?!
Yes, Master.
Yes, Master, and we caught them, him and me.
I have promised both The Wolf Man and The Mummy a reward.  It could be that <b>you</b> are that reward.
You need not worry...Not just now, anyway.
Aaaaannnnnuuunnnuhhhhh?
And the one driving the other car?
They didn't <i>tell</i> me anything, they asked questions.
He didn't want me to.
Oh.  Uh-huh.
Yeah, I was Emil's box-jumper for almost four years.
Listen to me.  I'm a good friend of Jack Foley.
Why don't we talk about it later?
I want to talk to her again, that's all.  See what would happen under, you know, normal circumstances.
You better come see this.
He knows where she lives?
I been thinkin', if I was Glenn, I was up there to take down the Ripper, where would I go?
They don't stay the night, Jack, 'less you pay for it.
Forty-five minutes.
Forget about my sister.  If Karen Sisco's tailing Glenn, we're fucked. Tomorrow night at the fights we all get picked up.
Time comes, we knock on the door.  See if he wants to talk about old times. Go in the easy way.
They put a gun on you, you still have a choice, don't you?
I don't know.
They're gonna rape the maid, aren't they.
Jack --
That's nice of you to offer, Karen, but I got all the help I can use right now.  Instead, let's talk about how you got the bump on your head.
Really?  Huh.  He told me he didn't remember how many he robbed.
They're in 7D.
Call and tell you.
Wait.  You not Adele?
Oh, is that right?  You going to shoot me?  Nice girl like you?  I don't think so.
Excuse me, Adele?
Why you think is today?
Yonelle.  Looks like someone raped her, shot her, then threw her out the window.  Fuckin' animals.
I report to the FBI, first thing they're gonna do is ask me to go get some coffee.
Listen, Raymond, a year ago, DEA had this guy Glenn Michaels on possession with intent but couldn't make it stick. In his statement, Glenn said he went up to Detroit to visit a friend and look into job opportunities -- if you can believe that.
We're a few minutes away.  Just sit tight, stay outta the house till we get there, understand?
I thought everything.
Not until recently.
Uh-huh.
I don't recall his hat, but I've seen pictures of him lying dead, shot by Texas Rangers.  Did you know he didn't have his shoes on?
Faye Dunaway.
You'd probably tell me.
Uh-huh.  Well, but if --
Why?  You think he might tell you where I am?
I'm partial to mountains myself.  But if you like islands, we'll make it an island.
Those guys bother you?
Love it.
I don't think it works if we're somebody else.  You know what I mean?  Gary and Celeste, Jesus, what do they know about anything?
It would be worth the risk.
She did, huh.
I don't know.  I hadn't worked that part out yet.  All I knew was that I liked you, and I didn't want to leave you there, never see you again.
I couldn't believe it.  I was thinking of you by then, a lot, wondering what it would be like if we did meet.  Like if we could take a time-out...
Where?
What about <i>my</i> motive?  Now I can say I fucked a US Marshal.  You think I will?
I'm trying not to.  I just wanna know what's gonna happen.
Studs.  Man, I haven't heard that since Lompoc.  What's going on?
That broad you picked up -- did you know she was a US Marshal, for Christ sake?
How many?
Oh, uh, right, thanks...
I don't know.  I never used a gun.
The fish saved my life.  Two years ago, I found out I had high blood pressure.  So my doctor, he tells me to go get an aquarium, look at the fish every time I felt myself stressing out.
It works.  You should try it sometime.
First, I'm goin' to Israel for a year, study the Talmud, work on a Kibbutz... then come back, maybe take some tennis lessons.
How are you, Richard?
A minute or two, you're gonna wish you were.
You gonna write me a check?
Five point two.
The Hejira was the flight of Mohammed from Mecca in 622.
The brothers in Leavenworth gave me the name.
Yeah.  That was the ninth.
Glenn?
Last fall, I drove you from the Palm Beach county jail to the federal courthouse, twice.  You're Glenn Michaels.  I never forget anyone I've cuffed and shackled.
I remember you now.  Shit.
No way, man, no fuckin' way am I gonna turn myself in.
Nothing.  I just wanna get the fuck outta here.
Yeah, the plan was to pick him up at his office tomorrow, take him out to his house in Bloomfield Hills.  Now, I don't give a shit what they do.
I don't know-- he doesn't exactly confide in me.
Really?
I know, you'll find me.  Jesus, I believe it.  I keep thinking if you hadn't driven me to federal court last summer, you wouldn't even know who I am.
You crazy, come up <u>here</u>?  It's fuckin one degree outside.
Gimme another hint.
Me?
I think you're forgetting, this is my car.  I drove it up here.
You look great.  Your dad taking good care of you?
Great.  We got one of 'em.
Oh...
How you know that?
Light to super-middleweight, as my body developed.  You go about what, bantam?
Your dog was killed?
What did you call it?
Which one is that?  The ATF guy?
Huh.
Off a tip?
Foley <i>kid</i>napped me.
The combination is three-ten-forty-four.
Ten gees.
White Boy, the man's not gonna hide no diamonds under the fuckin' mattress.
You mean hiding them?
Ooo, she's thinking of her date!  Come on, you've been dating a pilot.  We want to know what we can expect.
He was that good?
You don't forget love, Honey.  Not ever.
You liked that?
Where's that lizard?
He did.
Good shooting, Rafe!
Hey, you wanna test my limits, you better line up a couple dozen women on the GROUND...cause I got NO limits in the air!
It's a test.  If I asked her to come and she came, it wouldn't tell me anything. If I tell her not to come, and she comes...then I know she loves me.
Sure you did.  So come on.  Say what you think.
What facts are those?
Six P-40's.
Home of the brave.
What color flowers you want me to bring to your funeral?
Danny, what the hell are you trying to do out there?
They'll turn the ship into the wind before we launch.  That'll help.
Longer?  It's getting shorter.
I have a phrase I want you all to memorize:  "Lushu hoo megwa fugi."  It means "I am an American."  In Chinese.
Y-Yes Sir.
Thank you, Sir.
We can explain, Colonel.
Top secret means you help me pick the other pilots, train, and go -- without knowing where you're going until it's too late.
Dorie Miller, 'Mam.
How did you?...
It's not your fault, Rafe.  The letter I wrote you, they --
There's nothing you can do here, they'll die or they won't, we just --
They were bringing back a ship full of wounded and needed extra nurses along.  I wrote Colonel Doolittle, and told him I needed to see you before you go.
And if we fail, and lose our carriers, we destroy our ability to fight them at all.  As soon as the second wave returns, we will withdraw.
Have the planes made it to China?
God help them.
Learn English, then!
Grandpa, if you had a chance to do it all again, what would you do?
Goodbye, Grandma.
You're probably the only one who could carry it off.
We did for a long time. We just got married too young, and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things.
I can't. It's all too much.
Yes. Let's stay in touch.
That loudmouthed little bitch~
It's that jerk Walter.
Charlie...
I mailed it to you on Wednesday.
Pretty strange.
They'll learn to live with it.
Thanks.
Rejected, worthless, miserable.
Great, isn't it?
What?! You mean sex?! Intercourse?  You want to have intercourse! Last weekend you said... What time is it?
Save it.
I bumped into him after you dropped me off Last night. I didn't feel like going home, so we went for a ride.
And why do you always refer to yourself in the third person, like Napoleon? How come it always turns into an argument with you?
That won't make any difference. We just can't live together. And you had the nerve to drive up with that bimbo Janet.
I'm trying to save you years of frustration... waiting for a big break... no. Waiting for that big disappointment so you could blame it all on me.
Not terrific enough. What were you doing in that part of town? Who were you with?
That's real big of you.
It means I care about you and what happens to you.
What?
I know.
I'll love you, too, Charlie. I'll love you for twenty years.
Oh, God, Dion.
I'll never give up.
Of course.
Take a long walk on a short pier.
What if we're witnessing the end of touch dancing?
He won't tell me, but I've got my suspicions. And I don't want any of that. Don't keep her out late.
What're you doing here anyway?
I thought chicks like you traveled in packs.
They care about you. They're just a different generation.
For everyone.
I hate chickens.
It's not Charlie. It's me.
Oh boy, that's another thing that's going to change. Who's going to think for us? Our husbands? You know, you treat Mom like a maid. It's not entirely your fault. Those were the attitudes in the fifties, and that's the way you raised me. But give Nancy a break, encourage her to go to art school.
Look young lady, I grew up through the depression. I fought in the second World War. Six days a week I get up and deal with the public, the bank and the bill collectors. And on the seventh day, when God rests, I don't have to listen to my daughter calling me a fool!
Mr. Fitzsimmons is a very prominent man.
We've got to move fast. This is an idea whose time has come.
Mom, how about a machine that's like your blender, only it slices vegetables, kneads dough, chops meat and even make fresh pasta?
What? When did it happen? Your dad and I always expected you two to get married.
Let's do something together.. Do you want to play Monopoly? Or Careers... Clue... Snakes and Ladders?
You have an incredible memory.
I just did it for tonight. I don't normally dress like this.
Well, you showed them. You're rich and famous and successful. And you have a beautiful wife.
What was?
You know, I never told anybody this, but I always had a feeling that when you die, before you go to heaven, you get a chance to fly around high school for a while.
How, did you know about my grandfather?
Am I dead or not?
What if it's beyond science? What it it's God?
I'm just not the type. Besides, I want to get out of here.
Come on. You can't be serious.
High tech. I like the sound of that.
That's terrific. You did it. You really changed the course of your destiny.
No offense, but you're pretty out of it now.
Me? You went crazy! You started taking your clothes off. I was putting them back on for you.
I think it has something to do with your birthday. You were rambling. I didn't understand the rest.
It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out.
Wait! I'll go with you!
I don't know what you expected to find, Matthews. There's nothing wrong with the antigens, nothing to indicate an unusual death...
Not this dog. There wasn't enough oxygen in those red cells to pump life into a flea.
He did. We buried him.  There's a place out in the woods... if you bury something there, it comes back alive.
Just until he heals up?
He pissed me off.
What if it's not bullshit? If I bury Zowie there, and it works...  ...he'll come back alive.
Look, if there was even one chance in a million it'd work, wouldn't you want to try?
You never get over it.
Go later...
I came back for you, Geoff. We're going to be together again.
In a word, Bob...
Andy, do you know who reps Kronos Inc.?
What's wrong with my face? You want to know what's wrong with my face? I've got a skin condition. Next question, Bob? No more questions? Fine. Now can you help me find the complaint?
Sorry...
Yes, Bob, I do.  Excuse me? Am I being fired?
Because they deserve to, Walter.
What's that on your forehead, pal?
Andy?
Some people think you have an attitude problem, Beckett.
Yeah. Thanks, guys.
So what? It's nothing to be ashamed of. You have nothing to be ashamed of, okay?
You're not going to like this. Please try to smile...
I promise!
I said, skip it, Michael. It's my treatment.
No.
Then, what <u>are</u> we, Drew?! The <u>winners</u>? "Ladies and gentlemen, the first prize of AIDS goes to Andrew Beckett and his lover Miguel..." Excuse me, I'm not your lover. I'm your Care Partner. FUCK!
Ready for what, baby?
More than your friend. Family.
If you'd lost confidence in me, why did you give me the Kronos suit?
Sounds delightful.
Your Honor, I submit there were no complaints until Counselor began knocking on doors, drumming up business. And the dust, which Counselor refers to, has appeared on only three occasions. Each time it has been examined and the results...
Defined by Webster's as harmless.
Little baby girl.
Continue.
Continue.
We?
Makeup.
Charles, I must apologize again, for the Kronos mishap.  It was a scary few minutes around here. Wow. But thank God, the complaint was found. And no damage was done.
As in, the vegetable?
What's her name?
Rayisha. Very nice.
Thank you.
Any settlement agreement <u>must</u> include, and this is critical, a letter of exoneration, making clear my termination had nothing to do with the quality of my work.
We're friends of Beckett's.
Not bad.
Let's find you a drink.
Beer.  We need to go over your Q and A.
Correct.
Let me tell you something, okay? When you're brought up, like the rest of us, in a place like where I was brought up, there's not a whole lot of discussion about... homosexuals. As a kid, you're taught right away that queers are weird, queers are funny, they're a danger to kids, they're afraid to fight, and they all want to cop your joint. And that pretty much sums up the general thinking out there, if you want to know the truth.
Do you... pray?
You're ready, don't worry.
What impressed you about him?
I suppose you could say that.
What?
Get down to Word Processing. Help Jamey look.
It's impossible to know exactly when or how I was infected with HIV.
No.
That's right.
Absolutely.
One. Here, in front of my ear.
Answer the question, please.
Hi, Mom. It's me.
All I know is, you got through your diagnosis fine, like a trooper. But when they fired you... you were so devastated, Andy... I don't expect any of my kids to sit in the back of the bus. Fight for your rights.
Yes. I'm now in charge of the paralegal department.
What did you say?
I'll withdraw it. Mr. Beckett? Were you living with Miguel Alvarez in 1984 or 1985 when you had your anonymous sexual encounter in the porn theater?
Right.
Not by touching, or shaking hands, or hugging, using the same toilet... Even kissing someone with AIDS is safe. But it there's something in your past you're worried about...
We were satisfied.
In a word, yes.
Yes, character. To the extent that it affects a person's ability to do a great job.
What kind of people?
How many do you know?
Duh...
That's perfectly clear.
Yeah... ?
My lettuce is wilting.
Tell Iris all about it.  Take good care of Mrs. Finley, Iris.  Beckett, come in.
With all due respect, Your Honor... We don't live in this courtroom, do we?
You have to make a decision: is this guy partner material?
Bob. I must ask you to shut the fuck up. Did Andrew Beckett say "I might not be able to serve our clients to the <u>best of my ability</u>?" He said nothing. And now, Andrew Beckett proposes to haul me into a court of law, to sling accusations at me, in full view of the entire, Philadelphia, judicial establishment. My God.
Yeah, yeah -- we're all fuckin' amazed. Anyone not ready for this?
Oh, sure. Why not? Sounds like a hoot.
No, we'd never....Oh, God, honey, you shoulda told me sooner.
Slam doctor. Well, we called him "doctor."
We can, can't we? Trust you?
Hunger. I see 60 years of hunger.
Think about what?
Let's drop back an' boot up.
Riddick? How close?
Truthfully? I wouldn't know how.
You're fuckin' with me. I know you are.
Don't do this to me....
But they...they could still be....
It's starting....
Spirits. Anything over 45 proof burns well.
Probably right.
Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.
<u>We're gonna find the body</u>, Johns. Christ, you're a cop. Why am I tellin' you this? We gotta go down and find it.
Let's wait on the power cells.
That's what I said.
May've noticed chains don't work on this guy. Only way we're truly safe is if he believes he's goin' free. But if he <u>stops</u> believin' --
<u>You</u> made it a problem when you let Owens die like that. When you had enough drugs to knock out a fucking mule-team.
'Sokay, 'sokay. I killed it.
What the hell's it matter?
Riddick. <u>Riddick</u>.
-- tried to kill us in our sleep. Paris had it right -- we <u>are</u> disposable. We're just walking ghosts to her.
How much you weigh right now, Fry? Huh?
So what the bloody hell happened, anyways?
He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was looking right at him when --
You hear me? Captain's dead. Owens too.
So what, we should both go down too? Out of sheer fucking nobility?
Riddick?
What?
And what about the cells?
Those suns gotta come back <u>sometime</u>. And if these animals really are phobic about light, we just sit tight till then.
Not staying in here another....
We're movin'. And I'm just wondering if I shouldn't lighten the load right now.
Say that again.
About the girl.
They been nose-open for her ever since we left. They go off blood.
So much for my cocktail hour.
Maybe they had weight limits, you don't know.
You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?
Your conclusion is premature. Have you forgotten your Scripture? The Thirteenth Scroll?  'And Proteus brought the upright beast into the garden, and chained him to a tree, and the children made sport of him.'
Well? For a time the ancients kept humans as household pets.	Until the Lawgiver proved that man could not be tamed. Keep digging Cornelius. You'll find evidence of the master of this house: an ape.
Do you have any weapons?
Just the same, I want one.
Sorry, Taylor. The terrain around that lake is poisonous. There is no fresh water, no vegetation. Nothing.
Right now, if you like.
Good luck then.
No.
Zira, come on. You know they can't --  Oh oh. Here comes Number One.
And they fell out of the sky with you?
And even if it weren't, why fly? Where would it get you?
No creature can survive in that part of the Forbidden Zone. I've been there. I've seen it.
No, thank you'. I won't get into that battle.
Zira....
Let's find them all.
I don't know. This beast lost a lot of blood.
Show this to the President.
Climb off me, will you!
Don't bother
But I'm not prepared to die.
Let's take a look.
So you can talk.  I'm Dr. Zira's nephew. This abduction was her idea. You're not really going to the zoo. That's just our cover story in case we're stopped.  Although I do feel that if it ever came down to a question of whether something like you should be public or private property --
In my world -- before I left it - only youngsters of your age wore un- scraped hair.
Disillusioned...  But vindicated! I've been right all along. You can't trust the older generation. It's a matter of values --
I think you're making a mistake.
The Hunt Club.
A man, Dr. Maximus.
By your leave, Mr. President -- the Tribunal has not yet defined the purpose of this inquiry.
Read it yourself.
With one of them.
I take it you don't believe the prosecutor's charge -- that I'm a monster created by Dr. Zira.
All right, suppose I am a mutant? Why does the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic?
Then you admit --
I don't know.
When were the Sacred Scrolls written?
Very well. If Zira and Cornelius can prove that those scrolls don't tell the whole truth of your history; if they can show you definite evidence of another culture from an unrecorded past -- will you exonerate them?
Okay.Up to the cave.
He might have been wiped out by a plague. Natural catastrophe. Like a fiery storm of meteors. From the looks of this part of your planet, I'd say that was a fair bet.
Don't look for it, Taylor. You may not like what you find.
You're going back to the Forbidden Zone?
Wasn't I humiliated? By all of you? Didn't you lead me around on a leash?
All right, but....  ...you're so damned ugly!
Of course. He saw you moving yours.
Says he can't walk.
Yeah that long hairy orange and black bastard I found in the ammo crate. I'm gonna put it in this asshole's crotch, see if he can walk.
Fuck you bitch.
De fool think he's gonna get it but he ain't known for his thinking.
Shaddup bitch.
Barnes comes from Hell.
You mean he's crazy? No more crazy'n the rest of us been out in the bush too long.
I got one...
Hey take it easy man. They're scared.
No!
Yeah.
Fuck it, don't mean nothing, no such thing here as a coward, done your best man, next time y'do better.
What are the heads?
...there's nobody.
Who gives a shit!
Sounds like it.
Hey O'Neill why don't you cool it, you don't have to be a prick everyday of your life, you know.
Merle? Jesus!... Patty?
He dugged his own grave.
This is one time we could sure use Elias.
I'm going to Vancouver, Mr. Mitchell.
I really don't know.
How do you do?
Maybe you're going to have to like me.
How soon can I get a plane to Seattle?
You don't sound as if you liked him very much.
As I said before...
I never pay for anything. They just keep me here to amuse the guests.
I can be talked out of it. As a matter of fact, I'd like a dry Martini myself.
No thank you.
On a train. He said he lived here, and he offered to make a reservation for me.
There wasn't any plane.
That's putting it mildly.
Let's not pretend Mitchell meant anything to either of us.
Dance? Here?
I didn't notice him.
You don't know who he is?
He was following us--but he's not a policeman.
All right--following me.
So have I.
No percentage in that.
Yes.  I've never been very far from it, for a long time.  Will you do something for me?
But that's what I'm doing.  Couldn't they think of that?
This must have cost a fortune.
You wouldn't like it.  I've been there.
I can still see the shoreline. The moon is rising.
Frozen.
Wonder what?
The money that makes you Mr. Clark Brandon.  Let's you live in a penthouse, on top of the Vancouver Royal.  Lets you own a cruiser. Lets you do as you please, go where you please.  You big, open-handed, generous guy.  That's the kind of money it takes, isn't it?
And I'm begging for my life--and yours.
Magruder does.
Do you think I was faking?
Ale. I don't mind.
Who told you I was married?
Yes.
I've never been to Florida.
You were a galahad, compared to some cops I've known.
I don't want to talk.
What do your friends call you?-- The ones that know you well?--and like you very much?
They'll only find someone else-- who won't be so kind.
To do what?
I hope he can prove it.  Come on. You don't want to get pneumonia.
I understand, Betty.  I understand perfectly.
Morning. Any calls?
All right. Get him.
This way.
$40 a day and expenses. Expenses run pretty high on a case like this. I'm a long way from home. I don't have a B.C. Licence. I'd need about $500 for a retainer.
Charlie's suits me fine. I don't scare.
Fascinated.
No thanks. I had some. How would you like to take a walk for, say, half and hour?
You passed up a dozen chances to arrest her.  What toughened you up?
That COULD BE TOLD.
She didn't have to.  He could have climbed down from here.
Now and then.  Mostly just for the fun of it.
Lay off, can't you?
Did I do something wrong?
Nothing to discuss. Tomorrow the sun will shine even brighter. Be grateful for small mercies.
See how easy it is? Perhaps Miss Mayfield left her door unlocked. Or if she didn't, there's a passkey on every floor in the linen room. The head porter has a passkey. The bell captain has a passkey. The hotel's full of passkeys.
He saw my face too.
He was very easy to hate. If you'll look in your mirror, when you are in a better temper- you'll know why.
I'm sorry, Inspector, I don't know much about..
No, Not recently. I'm sure of that.
Drunk-rolling job.  They hit him too hard.
Go live in a tent.
Open it and count it.
So it seems Sergeant.
Somebody did it twice last night-- in the dark.
Pretty big chance, huh?
Well.  What about it?
Warm water, no doubt.
Try Betty Mayfield.  The Mitchell case.
I disagree, sir.  As Inspector in charge of the case I have the right to form that opinion, the right to act on it.
I think you'd be entirely justified, sir.
What are my orders, sir?
Who's the girl?
Why should I mind?
As thoroughly as I could. It wasn't easy. But you are helping me.
You ought to know why.
You don't have to make a pose of it.
I seem to recognize this routine. First the kiss then the touch.  Oh, what's the use. You're you.
That's not very kind.
A girl you meet on the train. Excuse my bringing it up again.  Be back in an hour. Right?
In an hour, Larry.
It's quite unimportant, Mr. Mitchell. After all, you got what you wanted.
To James.  I remember what it was I was going to say.  We were talking about forgetfulness.  The Czech writer Kundera has one of his characters say that the struggle of man against tyranny is the struggle of memory against forgetting.
I think you'll do very well.
We'll see you next week, and if--
Penfield.  James Penfield.
I see.
Hello.
...break away completely from--
...from all the moralising and talk of national humiliation that is now the standard line on Suez...
Very thoughtful.
No.  It's a bit of a madhouse. For some reason a lot of my mother's friends specialise in monologues.
Yes.  Might.  Remember, you're here to talk to my mother.
What did he want?
Any sign of the goddess Barrington?
No jokes.  James is in love.
Name so Susie Barrington.  Daughter of the eminent historian, Anne Barrington, step-daughter of the scandalous Matthew Byrd the acclaimed sack-artist...
Let me see.
Mmm...
On the torture of very small children, but don't start telling them about their rights--
Tame those rights...you know, we're even freighting in a couple of exiled Argie trade unionists from Paris for a TV tie in.  One of them had his balls tap-danced on by the secret police.  The other one had to be hosed off the wall of his cell after the police-- yes my good man?
Sorry.  Got held up.  What are you doing here?
Hello.
Next time tell her I've gone away.
Oh she knows you're very busy, especially now, with everything going on...the doctor said to try her on solids, but she's been right off her food...You take this up to her.  Tell her you made it.  She'll like that.
No.
I dunno.  Ploughman's Lunch.
U-huh.
You'd look naked without one.
Two years of surgery.  I missed my window.  Limped through law school instead.
The one you decked is Bunker Wiess. The big one is his brother, Warchild.  The other two always hang.  They think they're some kinda death squad around here.
Where?
Only make bets I can't afford to lose.  Only way to be 100% committed.
A flaw I'm working on.
News, last night... those guys, the Ex-Presidents... they robbed my bank yesterday.  And I was just there the day before, cashing a check.  See... look.  Assured Trust... same place.
My man!
Insurance policy.  Now this is going to sting a bit, but it's for your own growth, brah.  Press play.
She'll be fine, Rosie won't do anything.  At least not as long as I meet him at a certain place and time, about... let's see...  ... six hours from now.
See!  That's what I like about you, man!  You're just sharp as a razor blade.
Around somewhere.  Listen, I'm in kind of a hurry, Johnny U.  What can I do for you?
I'm not FBI anymore.
There's nobody else here...
Sir?
I take the skin off chicken.
A little mushy.
Take your hand off my shoulder right now.
Punk.  Quarterback Punk.
Yeah, they control the room well. Stick strictly to the cash drawers.
The fucking punks are surfers.
The lab made three possible matches, this was one of 'em.
Why can't I just walk around with this thing under my arm and act stoned?  Ask a few questions.
It sticks out, so I can't lock it. Look, Angelo, you think I joined the FBI to learn to surf?  This was your lame-o idea in the first place.  You gotta back me up on this.
Remember, all bank robbers are losers, but not all losers are bank robbers.
Right here, partner.
Angelo, we gotta talk.
Yeah, or cashing a check.
Sure.  No problem.  I'll just call up and tell him his favorite agent saw this one surfer moon another surfer yesterday and it looked real suspicious.  Shit, he'll probably call out the National Guard.
Yeah, he thinks he's evolved to a higher plane of existence, or something.  Maybe he has.  You've seen him surf... that frenzy.  It seems like anger.  It's not.  It's the energy of lovemaking.  The sea is the woman in his life.  She's his only true lover.
Warm them up.
Fuck you, Johnny Utah.  Fuck you!! Don't you have a soul?  Goddamn you to hell!
No way, old buddy.
You never were all that smart... let's go!!!
They're getting better equipped every day.
Jesus... this is inhuman.  Uh... I wasn't told of any operations in this area. They shouldn't have been here.
The wound all fused, cauterized... what the hell did this?
Bullshit. You're just like the rest of us.
What, Sergeant?
I saw it.
The best friend I ever had.
It's been a long time, General.
That's the problem. Apparently they strayed off course.  We're certain they've been captured by the guerrillas.
What's that, General?
I don't think that was any ordinary army taxi...
Hawkins?
I don't think so.  You should know we're going to fight you with every resource we have.
Huh?  Oh... yeah.  S'okay?  Uhm... how're... business things going.
Please, we hardly know each other.
Storage, I think.
You what?
What?
How are you, Mr. Kross.
Yes.
How?
You're very right.  I think the best thing we could all do is go home.
Uh, no.  How do I get to Beverly Hills?
If you can figure it out, be my guest.
Yeah, I peed in the fountain there once.  Give me a break.
What?
You mean they don't have hookers.
Off the boulevard.
Right.  So!  In town on business?
I've known a lot of everybody.
They should be.  They're both good at it.
I sell them.
What?
Of course.  How much?
Done.
Upset.  No.  I never get upset about business.
I have work to do.
He died a long time ago.
I really doubt anyone here frequents Hollywood Boulevard.
Shall we mingle?
I'm sure that's true for some of them.
Vivian, what the --
I don't know what you're talking about.
I want my fucking money.  I'm getting out of here.  I don't want anything more to do with you.
I'll call you a cab.  If you want the clothes, pack them up.
You won't.
I'll guard them and you with my life.
I'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you.  But you'll be surprised how much you understand.  The music conveys the story more powerfully than any words.
You just did.
What do you mean?
Thank you.
Afternoon.
Apologize to Elizabeth for me.
No.
Oh, god, what?
We don't have the time to bring someone new up to speed. Besides...  You've already impressed everyone you need to, haven't you?
Vivian's in sales.
Bill?  Stop panicking.  Kross isn't going anywhere and I don't need to spend the rest of the day watching his stock go down.  I'll be in the office tomorrow.
Yes.
I will.  I'm trying.  Meanwhile I got some crack left, you wanna get high?
Maybe we should get a pimp. Carlos likes you and --
Kit!  Where've you been?
In Beverly Hills?
Carlos.  I still owe him two hundred bucks...
What do you know?  You look <u>good</u>. All dressed up.  You clean up real nice.  You sure don't fit in down on the Boulevard, lookin' like you do.  Not that you ever did anyway.
Dummy.
Do I!?  Momma!
I'm gonna pay you back next time I see ya, babe.  Just wait, I'm gonna do something real nice for you some day.
Rent.  You're late.
Of rent I do not bullshit.
What?
Vivian.
Will I like it?
Okay.  Thanks, Barney.  You're the best.
But I always eat like this.
Steak spoon!
Professionally?
Miss Vivian.
I'm just looking, thanks.
I don't think it would fit you.
'Scume me.
I just might do that.
Aw, come on, Bill.  It's just business.
Then I'm here till I die?
Yes. Yes, of course. Naturally, not those four.
Should I be?
You admit to me you do not love your fiance?
"Are not capable of love" is what you mean.
I can't afford to make exceptions. Once word leaks out that a pirate has gone soft, people begin to disobey you, and then it's nothing but work, work, work, all the time.
Life is pain, Highness. Anyone who says differently is selling something. I remember this farm boy of yours, I think. This would be, what, five years ago?
Nothing you can say will upset me.
This is true love. You think this happens every day?
Move? You're alive. If you want, I can fly.
Well ... you were dead.
I will never doubt again.
But how is that possible, since he's been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago?
Now, was that so terrible? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           64.
Gently.
Gently!!
Did you say, "I do"?
You mean, you'll put down your rock and I'll put down my sword, and we'll try to kill each other like civilized people?
I'm waiting!
Yes, some of the time.
It's you.
Perhaps not. I feel fine.
-- what? --
His true love is marrying another tonight, so who else has cause for Ultimate Suffering?  Excuse me --
Where did you get that?
-- well, when does it get good?
Oh. You're sick, I'll humor you.  So now, where were we here? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ah. Oh. Okay. Westley and Buttercup raced along the ravine floor.
Well, who says life is fair? Where is that written? Life isn't always fair.
Okay.  All right, now, let's see. Where were we? Oh yes. In the Pit of Despair.
Sire.
Many of the thieves will resist. My regular enforcers will be inadequate.
The gate has but one key, and I carry that.
I tell you once again -- surrender!
DEATH FIRST!!
Of course.
Yes.
True, but that's hardly common knowledge, is it?  Thank you. Now, there may be problems once we're inside.
Have you ever considered piracy? You'd make a wonderful Dread Pirate Roberts.
-- power too -- promise me that --
I WANT MY FATHER BACK, YOU SON- OFA-BITCH!
Are you the Miracle Max who worked for the King all those years?
Okay. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           97.
Nothing comes to mind.
Again. Thank you.
I was eleven years old. When I was strong enough, I dedicated my life to the study of fencing. So the next time we meet, I will not fail. I will go up to the sixfingered man and say, "Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."
No one of consequence.
That would be inconceivable.
You're sure nobody's following us?
You keep using that word -- I do not think it means what you think it means.  My God! He's climbing.
You only think I guessed wrong --  -- that's what's so funny! I switched glasses when your back was turned. You fool.
It would take a miracle. Bye!
That's genius.  That's genius. Roger, I think I speak for Mr. Bloom and myself when I say that you're the only man in the world who can do justice to SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER.
"I want to croon,
"Honeymoon,
How do you do.  I mean ... Excuse me ... I mean ...
I'm Leo Bloom, I'm an accountant, I'm from Whitehall and Marks, I was sent here to do your books and I'm terribly sorry I caught you with the old lady.
Sir, may I speak to you for a minute?
Where?  What?
All right.  I'll do it.  I'll do it.
What you were saying.  Keep talking.
Well, it's very easy.  You simply raise more money than you really need.
Ahhhhhh!  But that's where you made your error.  You didn't go all the way.  You see, if you were really a bold criminal, you could have raised a million.
But what if the play was a hit?
Don't touch me!  Don't touch me!
It's a little better, but you still look angry.
Well, you know what they say, "Smile and the world smiles with you."  Heh, heh.  The man should be in a straight jacket.  Feeling better?
I already have.  Come on.
Right.
I'll do it!  By God, I'll do it!
It's gorgeous.  Absolutely gorgeous. You couldn't have picked a better color.  It brings out your eyes. Let's face it, Roger, that dress is you.
Mr. Liebkind, relax, relax, we're not from the government.  We came here to talk to you about your play.
Really, I never dreamed ...
That's exactly why we want to do this play.  To show the world the true Hitler, the Hitler you knew, the Hitler you loved, the Hitler with a song in his heart.
Come on.  Let's get going.
Nice girl.
No.  We go.
No.  No Motel.  Get car.  Get car.
Here I come, ready or not.
Good.  Let's fool around.  Now, I'll be the innocent little milk maid and you'll be the naughty stable boy.  Oh, this milk is so heavy.  I'll never reach the house.  Help.  Will someone help me?
We can't play today?
I don't know what's happening to me. I must be getting old.
Ta.  Ta.
By the sacred memory...
Of Siegfried...
Nietzche...
Oh joy of joys!  Oh, dream of dreams!  I can't believe it.  Birds, birds, do you hear?  Otto, Bertz, Heintz, Hans, Wolfgang, do you hear?  Ve are going to clear the Fuhrer's name.  Fly, fly, spread the words.
"Deutchland, Deutchland ... "
Stop!  Stop!  This is insanity.
Send for Goebbels.
No.
I'm looking for a missing person.  My name's Arbogast, private investigator...  Trying to trace a young girl who's been missing almost a week. From Phoenix.  It's a private matter... family wants to forgive her...  She isn't in trouble.
She might have used an alias. Mary Crane's the real name, but she might've registered...
What?
No one met her?
She didn't call anyone? Even locally?
You said she was sitting "back there," or standing rather...
How did she pay you?
And when she left, she never came back.
I do mind. If it don't jell, it ain't aspic!  This ain't jelling.
Anyone at home?
If this girl Mary Crane were here, you'd have no reason to hide her would you?
I didn't mean that as a slur on your manhood. I'm sorry.
Money.
What?
No. Thank you. I'm in... a hurry. I just want to make a change and start...
How much?
Five hundred.
All right.
I'd really rather not. Please.  Can't we just settle this and...
He's lunching with the man who's buying the Harris Street property, you know, that oil lease man...  so that's why he's late.  You getting a headache?
Teddy called.  Me... And my mother called to see if Teddy called. Oh, and your sister called to say she's going to Tucson to do some buying and she'll be gone the whole weekend and...
Her sister's going to do that.  She's as worried as we are.
Now. Your sister is missing how long?
With the forty thousand dollars?
Norman Bates' mother has been dead and buried in Greenlawn Cemetery for the last ten years!
May I talk to you?
I want to know if my sister is here.
Don't you know?
Huh?
Not that kind...  You men and your egos.
I didn't see her... and I didn't hear from her! Believe that!
Maybe we can handle it together.
Whenever I start contemplating the panic button, your back straightens up and your eyes get that God-looks- out-for-everybody look and... I feel better.
Yes.
An hour! Or less!
Where could he have gone?
I didn't. I got a job, too.  I wonder if that hurt her, my not letting her sacrifice for me?  Some people are so willing to suffer for you that they suffer more if you don't let them.
We were going to get married. Are going to get married!
This is the old highway.
I'm glad we didn't.
I haven't time to argue. I'm a working girl.
I pay, too. They also pay who meet in hotel rooms.
I'm late... and you have to put your shoes on.
You have a vacancy?
There's a big diner about ten miles on up... just outside Fairvale.
Thank you, Mr. Bates.
Mother...  ...what is the phrase... "she isn't herself today"... I think that's it.
It's all for you. I'm not hungry. Please go ahead.
You'd know, of course.
What are you running away from?
No. People never run away from anything.  The rain didn't last very long.  You know what I think? I think we're all in our private traps, clamped in them, and none of us can ever climb out. We scratch and claw... but only at the air, only at each other, and for all of it, we never budge an inch.
Sometimes when she talks that way to me I'd like to... curse her out and leave her forever!  Or at least, defy her.  But I couldn't. She's ill.
I'm sorry... I didn't mean it to sound uncaring...
I am sorry. I only felt... it seemed she was harming you. I meant...
Yes, and just one time can be enough.  Thank you.
Good night.
Yes.  I didn't mean to sleep so long. I was afraid I'd have an accident last night, from sleepiness... so I decided to pull over...
Yes. As I said, I couldn't keep my eyes...
Now what?
He traced her there and called us to say he was going to question Mrs. Bates...
Haven't any.
Leave me alone!
Mother, she's just a stranger... hungry, and the weather's bad...
Go on, go tell her she'll not be appeasing her ugly appetite with my food... or my son! Or do I have to tell her, cause you don't have the guts? Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?
Left Phoenix under her own steam?
Explains the private detective. He traced her to the Bates place.  What'd he exactly say when he called you?
Yeah, between the gangsters and the autos, we won't need another war to carry off the population.
What--special autopsy?
That's only natural. Maxwell will be here around eight tonight.
I knew there was a catch in this some place--but spill it. Quiet and dramatic. MAXWELL In the other room, I have a crazy woman that I have been treating.
How about me getting the help. She's quiet now, isn't she?
Maybe you want my money, too.
Take him to the psychopathic hospital.
You found Buckley?
Oh, Maxwell? He's left.
Oh, nothing. A cou- ple of my patients having a little argument.
It won't do any good. They are a pair of would-be mur- deresses fighting it out.
He isn't here.
The wound is bleeding!
Yes.
Joseph returns from the room where Gisèle is. He has evidently succeeded in calming her. He goes and sits in the chair where Nikolas sat. He rests his head in his hand. He sees the open diary and begins reading it.
Joseph is reading the diary, which arouses his interest more and more. It is as if he finds a connection between what he reads and the fearful events that have taken place around him. An extract from the diary is shown.
Another fragment of the diary is shown [having to do with vampires].
I don't think you could have a real affair. You couldn't care for anyone.
I don't agree with you.
You would.
I'll have it for supper.  So long.
No? Give me a chance, baby. Money is music in my ears, and when his old man kicks off there'll be a million dollar tune.
What's nice about her? ... a hard-boiled little gold digger.
I'd call it stupid at any time.
Thank you.
We have found immortality, you and I. You must not be afraid.
Nope, I'm through!
I want to see the original pictures of Joan Gale.
Well, you can't blame a guy for getting a little breathless with a scoop like that.
Work that up into a comic strip and syndicate it.
Come down to earth. Do you think they would dare do anything like that? Don't you think they'd know that figure would be recognized? Shake your head real hard -- you'll be all right.
Almost certain.
You here again like an evil spirit to mar my happiness?
What goofy idea have you got now? Don't tell me you suspect Judge Ramsey of stealing the body.
What does that prove?
It's all yours.
He's not a stag hound. His name is Kelly and he's a police dog.
Plain-clothes man.  Come on, slaves, drink and be merry for tomorrow you might be appointed correspondent to Washington ... a fate worse than death.
My lawyers will be on the job in a little while, and I warn you people anything you print about me you've got to prove. Dad won't stand for--
Not even if it gives you a clean bill of health?
No -- No -- I -- I -- I don't want to see it.
You go in for dangerous things.
I suppose this is going to sound absurd. I've only known you twenty-four hours, but I'm in love with you.
No, really -- I'm crazy about you.
You don't believe me. You think I'm just talking. Will you marry me?
Don't ask any questions. Come on!
Even those delicate veins, the texture of this flesh -- I have never seen anything more exquisite.
Good night, sir.
One of the maids-in-waiting for that Elizabethan group.
That doesn't seem so bad to me. What is wrong with it?
To lunch, you say. I am having coffee and sandwiches sent in. We are not leaving until we have everything ready for the opening.
He can't hear you.
Don't lose sight of him. This is the most important thing in my life.
You did miss --
Day or night?
I'm heading out of town.
The Buddhists have been saying that for a millennium.
But we must respect that power, we must be in awe of it.
I don't think you are sufficiently in awe of it. Get the castor oil.
But, Rose, what is the cause of it all?
But, Rose, how could such a thing as that happen?
Hmmph. It has a nipple, all right.
Can't I touch it a little, Rose -- not a lot, just a little?
Yes, I do. Please, Rose, be a good sport.
But Rose...
Am I hurting you?
No. No, I'm all right.  Oh, God, what have I done? I have robbed a cradle and fallen into hell!  I must be crazy, a child like you. Oh, God, oh, Lord. This is awful, this is terrible, I gotta get outta here!
Rose, I have got doubts about that doctor and so does Daddy.
You won't die, Rose.
What was your mother like?
Buddy, sex don't mean a thing to me. It ain't nothin' but a mosquito bite.  I'll tell you a secret. Girls don't want sex, Buddy, girls want love.
Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.
Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.
Well, yeah.
Daddy, what's the matter?
She's getting herself up to go out. I think she's coming down the hall now.
Let me see!
You shouldn't watch such things, Doll.
Your wife and children are back in New Hampshire in the snow?
Oh, no, no, she got all over that. Rose is fine. Let's sit down, son.
At rest in the creative universe with Mother, son.
A wonderful woman, boy.
I am afraid so, son. About a week ago. Her husband phoned me, she had asked him to call me if anything happened.
It's true, son. The girl with the cornflower eyes is dead, she is no more,
Then... may I speak quite frankly with you, Mr. Hillyer?
Well, well, well. So Miss Rosebud has arrived. Un-hmm. And you're all assembled here. Yes, indeed. Un hmmm.
Yes, it's so nice I thought I'd work outside.
Slow, hon. But at least I can concentrate now that Rose is here.
And she's such a good-hearted thing, there isn't an ounce of harm or malice in her.
Hope for the best? I don't understand all this skepticism. I thought you liked Rose.
Hotcha character. If I had to live with your cynicism, I wouldn't want to live at all. What you can't understand is that the creative forces of the universe are positive, not negative.
No, darlin'. Just that damnable insomnia in reverse. I sleep like a baby for an hour then I'm wide awake. You go back to sleep.
I'm serious. We forget he's just a child. I wish you'd speak to him.
Rose, you and Brother wait in the car. I want to speak for a moment Lo Mr. Hillyer.
Scoundrels? They weren't scoundrels, they were just boys.
Yes! Yes, I say that to you, they were boys! Boy friends of Rose, chat's what they were, and why shouldn't she have boy friends? Do you want her to be unnatural? Don't you think she's human the same way you are yourself? It's the South, that's what it is, the South with its horrible traditions, of slavery and crime and the oppression of women, who are just as good as men and just as human!
Just a moment! You are not going to fire this girl for an innocent thing like having boy friends, not while there is breath in my body!
Well, she does seem to cause a lot of trouble, I admit. But she doesn't mean any harm and it'll break the children's hearts, they all love her.
But what I said is the simple truth. And now I see something else, I see more deeply into it...
I don't see how you can even think of it now.
Um-hmm.  Come with me, Brother. I want to show you something.
No, she doesn't, she's fine, fine. She's perfectly healthy, don't give her ideas.
I don't give a hoot in hell's hollow what it means to her! She can't stay in this house forever! I fired her, damn it!
I am poleaxed and in a non compos mentis condition. I wash my hands or the whole thing.
Over... my... dead... body!
Well, I know, more so. That's why I was thinking... maybe she'd be better off.
I... I'll get the grits.
Yes, crazy about you! Kiss me, Mr. Hillyer!
There are more on the other side.
Oh, shut up, Rose, eat your cornflakes!
Boy, for four or five days there I didn't think I'd live. But I'm my old self again!
That's all you've got to say, you've got a bad cold?
Yes, sir.
Where is he? Where have you got him hid?  Ah, ha!
Yes, sir.
You mean a farm?
What?
No, you're not.
Perfect, wonderful, good as I ever felt! Except for a big old scar on my stummick, I wouldn't even know I been in the hospital.
She's te reason -- cured me of women once and for all. Oh, I got rid of her, Buddy, I didn't waste no time kickin' that bitch out. Hell, she was screwin' everybody in Savannah. I caught her in a motel with this long tall son of a bitch and boy did I beat the everlastin' piss out of him!
Yeah, I'll do that, Dave.
What do you want me to tell her, Dave?
You mustn't be a tattletale, dear. You mustn't be Delilah-ish and Jezebel-ish toward your brother, dear.
I don't know. I think he's cryin'!
Gonorrhea?
No, you shouldn't have, it was needlessly cruel. She thinks she has cancer and is going to die.
What do you mean, what kind of gobbledygook talk is that?
Mrs. Hillyer, I don't know who he is, I really don't.
I don't want to. When I was lyin' there in that hospital bed at death's door I says to myself, I ain't goin' out no more. If I ever get outta this, I'll just stay home.
I'm looking at this poster, and I'm thinkin', I don't remember seeing films like this when I was in school.
What were you gonna say?  Exactly how did you think he was gonna make the leap from dating a sweet, innocent school teacher to an ass-fucking porn star?
Incestuous.
Put up your kickstand, freak.  Start talking, or we're out the door.
I figure, for this information, the usual payment... times ten.
Hey, listen... I'll give you something else, Kittle.  Anything. Remember... remember that corpse washed up on Huntington Beach?  It was never identified...
Alright, wait... there's a dentist in Brentwood peddling morphine...
If I tell you, how do I know you won't just club me and take it back?
Where you been hiding, grease-fist? We've been looking for you.
Word is, while the vice cops on the East Coast were standing around playing pocket pool, 300 kilos of heroin got smuggled into New York City.  And, right now it's making a cross-country journey to Hollywood, U.S.A.
Again.
Filthy kids go to kindergarten too. What are you saying, anyhow?
What do you want me to do about it?
No you can't.
Who's that?  Zimmermann's money-man?
Could be worse.  I don't know how, but I'm sure it could.
Name one.
Entertainers don't count.
"Leo.  The stages of the moon are in alignment, so now is a perfect time for a vigorous regimen of self improvement.  Wash yourself more carefully each morning, stop using pies and cakes as your primary source of nourishment, and quit tucking your shirttails inside your underwear."
No, but it should.
It's go time, Billy-B.
Just keep an eye out till I get this rig up and running.
Hey... HEY!    Cool down, Jumbo!
Well, I got something..  Pop-Sweet's accounting ledger for the Disco-Strip.  All the money transactions.  Look...  Someone's putting their initials beside the weekly totals.  Like they're acknowledging a deposit.
I'm waiting till the time's right.
No.
Go wherever you want.  Live how you want.
You going rogue on me?
There was a time when you did things the right way, till you hooked up with that fat-assed-boozehound and the soul-sister.
I... I think I can... clarify...
What?
Till the last firework fizzles out tonight, detective, you sit a desk. And, after that, I'll decide if you keep your shield.
Just wanted to make you aware... before today's over, we'll be standing on top of your mountain of horse and pissing down on you.
You bust some small-time pimps, whores and dime-bag junkies, like the world's a better place because you're in it.  And for what, Kittle... two hundred and fifty dollars a week? Tell me, how does anyone get so self-rightious when they can barely afford to pay their rent?
It's our job.
Whoops... don't mind me.  Go ahead and finish up.
You know... you could say thank you.
All I'm saying is, your little Bicentennial mementos would be more accurate if there were no holes in the pepper shaker so the pepper couldn't get out.
Don't crowd him.
Let's hope.
Okay, okay... hold on.  Don't go getting your panties in a knot...
Out here.  On your knees.
Gimmie a minute.
Just got here.
Who is that... ?
Know what I love about dynamite?
When you bunch it together, it's exponentially more powerful.  Two sticks have the power of four sticks. Four sticks have the power of sixteen, and so on.
You won't get another chance at this, Admiral.
You cannot escape your destiny.
Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared.
I can't kill my own father.
Leia! Leia's my sister.
She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, Luke... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy Vader!
I can't see.
Where am I?
Who are you?
Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for.
A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor.
Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.
I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.
Hi, Han... Chewie.
Yeah, she's comin' up.
Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again.
Hold me.
No, wait! I thought you were blind!
You, too.
I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.
It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.
Come on! Come on!
Ohhh, I can't bear to watch.
Your Royal Highness.
Quiet.
Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
But, why must you confront him?
There is no conflict.
Never-r-r!
Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force.
No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.
Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.  But beware.  Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they.  Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.
I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily...
I know, but it wasn't all bad was it? I think you found it quite pleasurable.  Oh so soft.  So sensual.
Shush.  Janet's probably asleep by now. Do you want her to see you like this?
I told you, my car broke down.
And now he works for your Government, doesn't he, Brad?  He's attached to the Bureau of Investigation of that which you call U.F.O's.  Isn't he, Brad?
You are - so quake with fear, you tiny fools.
Janet.
Everyone knows Betty's a wonderful little cook.
I really loved the skilful way You beat the other girls To the bride's bouquet.
For you.
Yes, Janet.  Life's pretty cheap to that type.
Oh dear!  But then where did the motorcyclists come from?
But where will you go?  We're in the middle of nowhere.
Let's wait awhile Janet.  We don't want to interfere with their celebrations.
We'll just say where we are Then go back to the car We don't want to be any worry.
It's alright Janet, we'll play along for now and pull out the aces when the time is right.
Janet!  Oh!  Yes it's alright.  Janet. Everything's going to be alright.
And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to turn to stone The sweeter the wine The harder to make the break You hear something about someone You'd thought you'd known.
Uh - oh - Hi!  My name is Brad Majors. And this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss.  I - ah - wondered if you could help us.  Our car has broken down about two miles up the road.  Do you have a phone we might use?
Yes.
A decision had to be made.
Dr Scott I'm sorry about your nephew.
Makes you cry
From Transexual Transylvania.
So come up to the Lab.
Oh my, my,
Free to try and find a game
Sha la la la That ain't no crime - That ain't no crime.
You're too kind.
Creature of the night.
...I don't know.
...Goodnight, Rocky.
Absolutely.
Ohh!
It doesn't bother me either.
Morning after?
Why do you do it if it hurts so bad?
...No thanks.
I wanna let my brother know where I am.
Yes.
I don't think I belong here.
...I've never been in a man's apartment before.
What?
Do me another favor?
I don't know -- I was shocked. Why did you do that?
They either say, 'Kill the nigger' or 'Hope you die, Honky.' -- What ya got in the bag?
Sharp -- Real nice.
Yo -- I ain't mad. I'm just outta joint when reporters are around -- They take cheap shots an' Paulie knows it.
...What?
I don't want ya cleanin' nobody else's cages no more.
Don't say that.
That so.
Paulie!
Get that doctor.
Fouls.
Rocky Balboa -- His record's poor --
He was big, an' very nasty so I destroyed him in a hurry -- Now I'm gettin' ready for Mac Lee Green next month.
That's right -- It's gonna be the greatest sportin' event in this country's history -- A gala occurrence!
She ain't retarded, she's shy.
Move your shoulders down.
...No wine -- Bad for ya' brain.
Why?
...Ten minutes.
This guy is beautiful -- get the Cokes.
Yeah -- My ol' man who was never the sharpest told me -- I weren't born with much brain so I better use my body.
Thank you, Bob. The electricity is everywhere tonight. Rocky Balboa, a fifty-to-one underdog, is living a Cinderella story which has captured peoples' imaginations all over the world -- to quote a popular sports magazine, 'The fighting style should be 'The Caveman Against the Cavalier.' From the increase in sound it appears the challenger is now approaching the ring... His record is forty-four wins, twenty losses and thirty-eight knockouts.
The Champion is smiling and toying with the man -- trying to give the fans their money's worth and make a show of it with the badly out-classes challenger -- Another left to right combination. I feel sorry for --
Round three ready to start and should be interesting to see if Creed can put the challenger away -- there goes the bell.
Don't mouth me, old man, I'll knock yo' out too. C'mon, wop, spar me, let everybody see who's got the heat around here.
Mr. Gazzo wants the two hundred now!
Thanks, Mr. Gazzo.
Do I have to pay juice?
I'm gonna do somethin with it.
Black market?
Rocky.
I like 'em. If you don't you can f --
I like yella teeth.
C'mon, Rocky. I'm twelve.
'Night, Marie.
I said, how ya feelin'?
...Tomato?
...What?
Twenty-five, thirty -- What's the difference? -- It took me two months to learn the combination of that locker.
Yeah, Kayo.
You think everybody I fight is a bum.
Listen, I'm gonna take a steam -- Did good last night -- Shoulda seen it.
Message -- What message?
Ya puttin' me on?
Probably lookin' for sparrin' partners.
Fifty years. The rep is known around Philly, an' a good rep can't be bought, but I don't have to tell you that.
The fight's set -- I don't need a manager.
I never had good footwork.
Would you keep goin'?
It ain't your locker no more.
Yeah -- See the fight last night? Apollo Creed beat that English guy bad.
'Bout what?
He ain't losin' nothin'.
Inventin' jokes ain't easy.
What?
I'm thirty myself.
I hate the friggin' game... I'd like to talk some business.
Look at my hands -- See how the joints are swollen.
Maybe ya should see a doctor.
Gazzo's gotta come to you -- Hey, Paulie, it's a bad job -- Do what you do now.
Maybe ya better forget it.
Don't it matter none he's makin' ya out a fool? -- I'd break his lips.
Ya gotta have a guy help ya exercise, mebbe somebody to be standin' by with a towel or run errands, y'know.
Without havin' good people around, ya won't have such a good chance.
Gazzo's a good man.
What break? Huh? What break! Who am I to give breaks! I'm a fighter, you haul meat. You do what you do an' I do what I do best -- that's it -- that's life, man!
...People talk to me more.
Maybe --
Do you have anything derogatory to say about the Champion?
Yeah?  Does he wear pants this color?
Big on the musical comedy, huh?
I'm not worried about you.  I'm worried about the safe.
Oh, yeah?  Well, you're not handcuffed to him.  Anybody in the back room?
Probably lookin' for a good place to stick a knife.
What the hell would they want with a gag factory?
What've I got to lose?  You okay, Dolores?
Surprised?
That's right, me.
No...
That's because I don't have a doorbell.
No, no, no... I love my husband.
I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.
When I opened up the blue envelope, all that was inside was a blank piece of paper.
No one knows.  He bought the election a few years back.  He's been rulin' Toontown ever since.
Only there's no business like it, no business I know.
I don't work in Toontown.
The job's gonna cost you a hundred bucks.
As soon as is humanly possible.
I've already seen your photographs.
No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.
No, you gotta understand, Valiant, I had nothin' to do with Acme gettin' killed.  I just wanted to sell my studio.  But they wouldn't buy my property unless Acme would sell his. And he wouldn't.  So I was gonna blackmail Acme with pictures of him and the rabbit's wife.
Yeah.  Except they screwed up.  I don't think they got the will.
Why, you crazy Toon... I've been out there riskin' my neck for you.   I come back here and you're singin' and dancin'.
Just because you got 'em to laugh?
What is this, Twenty Questions?
Him?  Oh, he was vile, heinous, despicable... a smear on the drafting board.
That's why I'll be there at 8:45.
Not before I satisfy my sense of moral outrage.
Yeah?
[Aside to GREGORY] Is the law on our side, if I say ay?
Uh? Uh?
Romeo will answer it?
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
In love?
At thy good heart's oppression.
Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit With Cupid's arrow; Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes, Nor open her lap to saint-seducing gold:
Teach me how I should forget to think.
Art thou hurt?
Then plainly know my hearts dear love is set, on the fair daughter of rich Capulet. We met, we wooed, we made exchange of vow. I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray, that thou consent to marry us today.
O, mighty is the powerful grace that lies in plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities: for nought so vile that the earth doth live but to the earth some special good doth give, nor aught so good, but strain'd from that fair use revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse: virtue itself turns vice, being misaplied; and vice sometimes by action dignified. Within the infant rind of this weak flower poison is resident and medicine power: for this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part; being tasted, slays all senses with the heart. Two such empossed kings encamp them still in man as well as herbs, grace and rude will; and where the worser is predominant, full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
She'll not come down tonight.
Talk not to me, for Ill not speak a word. Do as thou wilt for I have done with thee.
Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I! O, my back! Other' other side,--O, my back.
Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?
Then hie you hence to Father Laurence' cell; There stays a husband to make you a wife
If I profane with my unworthiest hand This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this: My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
Well, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do; They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
Romeo, O Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name; Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
Thus..... with a kiss...... I die.
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed.
A man, young lady! Lady, such a man As all the world- -why, he's a man of wax.
Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.
Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
Is love a tender thing? It is too rough, Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
I dream'd a dream to-night.
Right.
Could you not take some occasion without giving?
As if that name, Shot from the deadly level of a gun did murder her, as that name's cursed hand did murder her kinsman.
Leaving...
Very good.  Now all we have to do is live long enough to get paid.
I'm up for that...
Budweiser?  You talk to me of beer and you've the unbridled gall to mention Budweiser in the same sentence?  That's not beer!  Christ, it's not even a poor excuse for rabbit piss.
Not yet...
You were a soldier, were you?
Nobody's saying they don't.
I probably do.  But for the time being, I'm willing to forget about it...
Alright?  It's bloody fucking freezing in here!
These days they they call me Gregor -- and I'm a tech.  I do electronic work, surveillance, computer runs.
I use my cell phone to get computer access to the telecommunications satellite used by our target.  I trace his cell phone signature and use it to pin point his location as he moves through Nice, relaying that information to you.
Really?  Do you have the money with you?
No, Mikhi, I wouldn't.  Since I won't speak your language, and you can't speak mine, English will do nicely.
Enough!
I swear, it has to come here!  It has to...
Figured enough to know there's an odd man out and I'm looking at him.
I sent it to myself in Paris.
That's it.
How did you know?
No booze...Pain's in the mind, and the mind I can control.  Alright, let's do it.
You should learn a little patience.
I know cops -- and you're no cop.
As in, they own it?
I don't.  But the language he's speaking is universal.
I do.
So is the woman.
I wonder if she truly left the IRA.
I wanted to see who you were.
That's right: there's not hardly enough work these days, nothing that pays the big money, anyhow.  Then along comes this job, paying so much goddamned money I couldn't afford not to take it.  Somebody's paying through the nose for this.
Gregor's cell phone...
You weren't around when I woke up, I thought maybe something had happened.  This has been one very fucked up job, Sam, and I'm not taking any more chances on anybody...  Including you...
You know one around here?  Somebody you trust?
Yes.
The address of the Russian production company.  Just in case we need to find them.
Do what?
Just like that?
Why?  You've got more force of will than anyone I've ever seen.  You handle a gun like it's a part of you, you perform surgery on yourself without anesthesia...  And most amazing of all, you quit smoking, just like that.
Why then, Sam, don't you act like this is a job like any other?  Surely, if you are a hired gun, you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for.
I'll work on it...
What?
You don't owe me a goddamned thing, Vincent, and you know it.  You stepped in front of a bullet for me.  I owe you a heavy debt.
You should have kill him when you had the chance.  But no...
You said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape?
I get the picture.
I gotta try and overcharge him, he has to moan about the price, we settle somewhere in the middle.
Looks like some kind of drug deal or something, they're not from around here --  one of them's still alive.
The horniest dog in Nevada.
Well I hope so.  That pretty much cleaned me out.
I hear you.
What do you mean what are we going to do?
Why?  Are you kidding me?
It's going to go bigger than that. Could you stare someone straight in the face and lie about it?
Oh so God's like Western Union and he just dropped us a couple million bucks?
You're thinking about killing him.  I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one...
I...I can't do that.
Oh, right, with a little help from his pals Booth and Earl.  I'm sure that's gonna fly real far when they hear that tape...
What are you thinking?
Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note	or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's just a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
All right enough!  I'm tired of thinking about all this!
All we have to do is get our hands on the original tape.  We'll set him up somehow.
No.
If you're any friend at all, you'll stop talking like that!
I don't think he's going to be doing any bargaining with us, the stupid son-of-a-bitch!  Besides, I'm not giving him a third of anything, not after everything we had to do.
I don't know!  Shit, give me a break!
I'm just making our intentions clear. Go check the desk.
There it is...now what about the others?
I sure as hell hope so.  Let's go.
We'll take the money and disappear! We can do it, spend it on the move. Even if all of it's marked, there's ways around it.
I know, I know.  Dwayne's dead, but we can deal with it.  We'll pin it on him.  The DEA was driving Jesse's car. No car phone.  No radio.  They couldn't have called me in.
It's NOT too late!
No.  It's not.
You better believe it if you know what's good for you!
No.  Why?
Maybe.  That's where it was during Denning's last report.
You mean that guy was an agent?
Hi.
I'm just tired is all.  I'll see you tonight OK baby?
He's not, he's...
Well, I can't let you down now, can I?
How the hell did he find it?
It'll be more than enough.  We can get out of here...
I don't know.  My friends...
First you question my integrity, then you call me stupid...  ...that hurts, son.
Cause we got footprints leading into that brush, I want to see where it leads...  Jesus, seven dead.  I'll tell you I've never seen carnage like this in all my seventeen years of sheriffing these parts.  I don't like it.  Not in my jurisdiction.
Hell, I don't know.  If I had some input I'd offer it up.
Don't you think I would have told you that!
Lingerie...
Sure.
Oh yeah.  Between here and Vegas we get a lot of customers.  All types.  Even had an officer, just like you.
Yeah whaddya want?.
I  have complete faith in you. But don't you go speeding.
No.  Something wrong with you Dwayne?
What?
A surprise huh?  Well I don't like any surprises, especially if I'm forking over the loot for them!
And if we refuse?  Your tampering with evidence isn't exactly a misdemeanor, did you ever consider that?
What?
Well you're not getting, either.
Hi.
It was pretty gory ma, let me tell you.  But you have to turn all that off, and do your job, just like pop used to say.
And what happened?
And not just any air conditioner. This baby sells for over six hundred dollars retail.
Yeah.  Figured you could have it.
There was more than that.
That doesn't tell us much. Did you run a check on the gas like I told you?
No, it doesn't.  Neither does his blank tape.  Any news on that?
I'm not getting an answer.
Two hundred cops?  Was Mario Sanchez there?  He owes me money.
I'm with the band.  I'm the lead singer.
I got held up at a wedding in Tai Koo. Ricky here yet, I need to get his requests.
What??  Where'd you hear that?
Is this about the funny money?
You've been asking loud questions in all the wrong places all morning.  How come you always save me for last, James? When are you gonna learn.  Shit don't happen I don't know about.
One of my regulars lost fifty thousand dollars at the table here last week.  I was about to send my boys down to tune his ass up, when the guy comes in and pays off the whole thing.  Including the vig -- brand new sequential hundred dollar bills.  I knew something was wrong.  Cause this guy's got a regular job, no way he comes up with fifty grand in cash. But I tested the bills, infrared.  The whole thing.  And they checked out. 100%.
I don't think so.
What the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money?
I ain't his partner, I'm a tourist.  I got proof.  See, I got a mini-bar key.
C'mon, Lee.  He's going to jail.  You won, now just put the gun down.
You play games with me, Detective, and you'll lose every time.  Don't forget. The odds are always in favor of the house.
Those girls drove off because of you.
You invited them to get naked and sacrifice a small goat.
Don't be giving me attitude, Lee.  I've been here three days and we haven't done shit.  We haven't been to a club, haven't even talked to a girl.  I'm on vacation, and I want some mu-shu.
Don't be messing with me, Lee.  I will kick your ass.  I'll hit you so hard you'll end up in the Ming Dynasty.
I knew you were lying.
Man, are you crazy?  You think that scares me?  I'm from  L.A.  We invented gangs.  We were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it.  We get royalties from other gangs.  Now gimme your badge and gun and I'll show you how it's done.
Try to land on your feet.
No time.  There was an explosion at the American Embassy today -- two American translators were killed.
I'm calling for back up!
Who died?
Nobody understands the words that are coming out of your mouth.
Ask me if I give a shit.
How the hell did Tan get away with it?
This is about your Daddy's death?  Hell, Lee, you know my father died on the job. You could have told me...  This is about more than all that, isn't it?  This is about your Daddy's last case, right?
Lee, let me introduce you to the Carter Theory of Criminal Investigation: Follow the Rich White Man.
Hot?  I'm freezing my ass off.
What's going on?
What?
It's your turn!
There's people up here!
We are not partners.  Between your daddy, my daddy, and the beating I just took, as far as I can tell all partners get you is dead.
I don't believe in reincarnation.  So I won't see you in the next world.
No kung pao chicken.  Never.
I knew it.  What does she know.  You want me to sing something?
Who's Benjamin?
Oh no you don't.  Don't you be getting corny on me, Lee.  I'll kick your ass from here to Compton.
That was the name of Ricky Tan's boat.
I guess so.  Thank you, Carter.
Some Kung-Pao?
Fine with me.
Then you know I'm not walking away from this case.
Why don't you go get them?
How do I know I can trust you?
The police can protect you.
Tell me why they killed the customs agents.
Chief Inspector Lee will brief your people...
Do I look like I'm movin'?!  What you're seeing here?  This is not movement. This is my "still".
The first drop will be made tomorrow. At twelve o'clock.  The amount will be fifty million.
OK. Say what it is.
Let me give you a piece of advice: never touch another man's radio. You do it again, nobody, not Rhonda, not Yolanda, gonna save your ass.
No.
I was being polite.
You don't know what a shortcut is?
Did you make the plate?!
Hey, stop.  We're just gonna wind up in some bar, drinking' to forget all the things we shoulda done and then you'll start singin' Beach Boy songs again. Then I'll really get depressed.
Thank you. I learn a great deal.
Yes, I know this song.
Yes, I think so.
Yee-aww.
Good God, ya'll!
Be sorry for Soon Young. She has no chance now.
Hey, don't worry.  Nothing's gonna happen to it.
No shark fin, no camel hump.  What you listenin' to?
Yes I do. That's all I got. Guts and you, Johnson. There's no one else I can trust.
It's called a dress.
That's it! You can attack me, but when you attack my car, I cannot forgive! You in the back, girl!
I'm not interested, Carter.  You're no longer on this assignment.
And your buddy, Mr. Lee, is on his way back to China.  Now, get out. Before I file obstruction of justice charges against you.
What are you talking about?
You have what I asked for?
Let him come to the wedding.  You're not running, right?  Say it. "I'm not..."
So if you're not running and Ike Graham is there to see it, then any article he writes has got to have a happy ending, right?  All we're doing is turning lemon into lemonade.
I lead Maggie through a visualization exercise.  All the sports shrinks use this head stuff.  Visualize the end zone, if you catch my drift.
What?  You talked to him!  Did you tell him we dated before you were a priest?
Could your confess to Father Patrick from now on?
Yes, rubbing your ears is very soothing. Cory does that to me when I hyperventilate.
I merely write the stuff.  You're the one that serves it up.
This is about her negative attention, not mine.  Did you get the reimbursement for the dress yet?
Not bad.  I was traveling around studying the reproductive and migratory patterns of locusts when Maggie met me.
Tootaloo.
Are you a reporter?
-- The luau for Maggie.
Thank you.
Oh, yeah.  Scared the hell out of Skipper.
Ah, beautiful.  I just can't see her leaving multiple grooms in the dust like that.
But the most interesting thing here is that I don't see the rose tattoo that I've heard about on your back.
Maybe it's just me, but -- if you got to dress it up, it doesn't ring true.
You don't know.
Fine.  The newspaper's upside down. That's better than fine.
Gram here was going to give me the skinny on why you run from marital bliss.
It was in the attic.  It was jus sitting there gathering dust.
Can you fix it?
Or maybe you just wanted to wear the headdress.
No, that's called not having a mind of your own.  What are you doing, Maggie? You really want to let that man drag you up Annapuma on your honeymoon?  You don't want to climb Annapuma.
No you don't.  You want a man who will lead you down the beach with his head over your eyes just so you can discover the feel of the sand under your feet. You want a guy who will take you into a cave with a thousand candles just to read you a poem.  You want a man to wake you up at dawn because he's burning to talk to you and he can't wait another minute to find out what you'll say.  Am I right?
Me?
Well, you do have the dress.
I was, because if you said "yes" right away, I wouldn't get to say this next part.  And I've been practicing it.  Ready?
"I guarantee that we'll have tough times.  I guarantee  that at some point one or both oof us will want to get out. But I also guarantee that if I don't ask you to be mine, I'll regret it for the rest of my life. Because I know in my heart -- you're the only one for me".
He looks better with that stuff out of his hair.  He's an attractive man.
No.  I'm weird.  Weird and mysterious are two different things.
I haven't seen him in twenty-four hours. It just gives me the creeps a little bit. I'd feel better if I knew where he was.
No, I'm just going to head home.
Quick.  Very quick.
That's good.
Don't be silly.  I'll just be ten minutes behind you.
Walter, I'd love to --
-- it was a betrayal.
I think that's what I'm saying.
About what?
Nothing's with me.
That's what she called him on the show.  Because he can't sleep.
They knew it.  Time, distance, nothing could separate them. Because they knew.  It was right.  It was real.  It was...
I'm going to marry Walter.  I just have to get this out of my system.
I should say something in this about magic.
I always wondered about that too.
Thank you.  I love you.
So I mailed your letter.
We're going to the Rainbow Room and the symphony tomorrow night.
So you want a financial, is he a deadbeat, we can do a D&B --
Oh.  Like Glenn Close in that movie.
I know.
That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go home.  I quit.  Laurie, I quit.  I'm going back to Baltimore.  How does a blonde do a high- five?
Come on, Jonah --
Hi, Jonah.  Sam.  And who is this?
I got married because Betsy said we had to break up or get married.  So we get married.
Yes, I did.
I know.  He's wonderful, isn't he?
Destiny takes a hand.
Then how do you explain that you both ordered exactly the same sandwich except for the bread? How many people in this world like lettuce and tomato without something else like tuna?
What?
What?
Mom, we already...
Hello.
Hi.  So far so good.  So.  What should we talk about? How insecure we were in high school.  Shirley Votypka, the first girl I ever felt up. Health.  What about health? Did you know that eating six macadamia nuts is the equivalent of eating a steak?
Thanks, but I'll pass.  It's kind of a big night.  I don't like to leave Jonah alone.
And if I could describe it, it probably wouldn't be on a radio show.  But what the hell.  It's not one specific thing.  It's more of a feeling.
It's not that late in Seattle.
She died.
You want me to talk to him?
It is easier to be killed by a terrorist --
Right, right.
You mean, like, "He has the cutest butt"? Where did I hear that recently?
What's tira misu?
I have forty-two.  So that would definitely cover taxicabs, I think.
I don't know.  Do I?
It's a spice rack.
It plays in 50 states.
Oh, you're changing your mind --
Jed is having a slumber party New Year's Eve and he invited me.
Stressed.
You're worried we're going to be all right.  We're going to be all right.  I remember sometimes you'd have nightmares as a baby.  Your mom would hold you and rock you and sing you a song.
Good.
The heels on these shoes are very large.  Why have I never noticed this? The heels on these shoes are grotesque.
Everyone thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
Was Mom an adjustment?
It might be in the kitchen.
Thank you, Jonah.  But the point is, I am not asking permission.
I can't know what I said, but we're not going.
I was scared of what you were gonna do.
No.
Okay.
Yes, I do.  In fact, my firm has box seats for the Mariners. Why don't we all go next week?
Hi.  Sam?
You look good yourself.
You could have called me --
You <u>are</u> the first woman I'm going out with.
I know her pretty well.  Maybe I could call her --
Absolutely.  When I come back, maybe the two of us should spend some time together, on our own.  What do you think?
No. My name is Quintero. Mister Quintero.
I say we gotta take action. Now.
It's the paymaster from Moscow -- with our gold.
It never ends.
Yeah.
The woman question?
So? What does he want to do about 'em?
You know the beef. This new rule of yours, that we work alone. We're taking it up with the Super.
You work alone, savvy? You can't handle the job, I'll find someone who can.
It isn't right, she says. Was it right that we bought this ... this instrument?
What's more important than sanitation?
If I think of myself it's because you never think of me. Never. Never. Never...
Antonio paid for it.
He'll have it good. Some day.
I'd lie on my cot in the cell and I couldn't sleep with the bugs and the stink and the heat. And I'd say to myself, think of something nice. Something beautiful. And then I'd think of you. And my heart would pound against the cot for love of you.
What makes you so sure?
No, no ... the Sheriff had enough of us. We drove him crazy.
You weren't waiting for me.
Hunting.
Why not? I'm not needed here.
Sure, the standby squad. Stand-by for the funeral.
Aah! They've got other mines. You don't see the larger picture.  They've got millions. Millions. They can outlast us, and they know it.
Will you be still?
Then why's the company hanging tough? They've signed contracts with other locals -- why not this one?
Exactly. And equality's the one thing the bosses can't afford. The biggest club they have over the Anglo locals is, "Well -- at least you get more than the Mexicans."
You mean Delaware?
It's possible. Just negotiate.
It's Mama's Saint's Day.
Papa! We seen 'em! Two scabs! Over there!
What attitude?
No.
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.  Rhymes with ...
How about in the house?
Just make sure you come alone. This guy won't like any surprises
I was thinking Alice Cooper.
Come on, cheer up. It could be worse.
Colette ...
Nothing.
Don't worry. He's out of town.
Nothing.
You don't like the tune, find another station.
No. But I'm the only one with my sad story.  And that's how it's gonna stay.
What about a battered woman's shelter? You can move you kid in with you.
You can still work.
You always been this stubborn?
I just can't. Okay?
I can't tell you.
I don't want to leave you.
Guess it's our turn.
You're brain is in reverse mode ... cutting off your supply of dopamine. Here.  Have a beer.
Business.  I need to leave town and I find myself in dire need of some cash.
I find myself in dire need of some cash.
Yeah, Pooh-Bear.  Dude is a big-time cook. I'm talking dire.
Can your man handle that?
Palmdale
I think on account of his nose.
No. I'm good.
Tem thousand dollars. Everything I could spare.  It's for you.
You ever notice how I always showed up, in the middle of a binge? Left before it was over? How I sneak away for cap-naps? How when the crank came around to me, I always said I'd just done one?
I don't trust anybody.
Because I don't want to see you end up like Kujo and those other losers.  I thought that maybe if you knew that I didn't use, you might see it in yourself to go clear.
What does that mean?
Understand what?
Um, I think the Warren Commission has been closed for a while.
Pull your motherfucking pants down.
Big Bill
Yeah, dickhead.
I can't help it, Tanner, you hit like a fucking girl.
This chink have a name?
What's to stop him from just ripping me off then?
I'm afraid so, Danny.
Pumped fifty-seven bullets into a police informant.
Hey, you want me to do all your work for you, numbnuts?
I still don't know what you're talking about.
Who the hell is Jimmy?
You mean the menacing red car?
I'm making the small buy tonight ... if I don't get beaten to death with a wheelchair or something.  If everyone is happy, we'll do the big deal later in the week.
With you clowns watching my back? What do you think?
Hey, do you think you could eat me if you had to?  And if so, which part do you think you would find the most delicious?
What do you mean?
Quit feeling sorry for yourself, Tom. It gets old.
Don't we always take good care of you?
Good work, Flynne.  You're a first-rate rat.
Maybe he isn't showing.
Don't worry about it.
It was a hard assignment, that's why you got it.
Where are your men now?
Figured.
You got somethin' against the Cap'n?
Army life is too dang easy, my feet have gone soft.  Back home, we go out squirrel huntin', I walk forever and a day and then some, don't even raise a blister.
Wade, Sarge, Corporal Insect, all of us, hell, I'll bet even the Captain has a mother.
Yep, you step on a rusty nail, get lockjaw, never say another word as long as you live.
You didn't volunteer, Jackson.
They don't send planes to put out machine guns.  Two flank runners with surpressing fire.  I'm going right, whoever goes left has to be fast.
That's General Gavin's.  His lap dog told me if anyone breathes on it, I'll get busted and if anyone so much as touches it with their little finger, I'll get court marshaled. If you were to take it, they'd shoot me.
That's not all.  There were nine gunners on the eighty-eights, one had a broken heel on his boot, two had bratwurst for supper last night, one of them is named Fritz, the other, Hans, maybe, I don't know, it's hard to tell.
Plenty.
Same place we are.
You don't count.
Sure, you got one?
I changed my mind.
Rolls his eyes, takes a breath. Scrambles into the gap.  The other five right behind.
Some private up there lost three brothers, got a ticket home.
Okay, Wade.  Translators?
What about Talbot?
More morphine, hurry up, come on, come on...
Bits and pieces.
Just what I want to do.
Out of the mouth of babes.
Don't worry, we're the only Rangers this side of the continent, we've got to be first into Caen.
Stay at it until you get fire control.  Keep 'em down, wait for the navy.
No, I'm not, Kaback is, honest.  Or what about Faulkner?  Or that little guy with the glasses?
Why's that?
That's a mystery to me.
Looks like tea time, maybe they're Brits.
See to it.
Yeah, yeah.  I want you right next to me, no matter where I go, you understand?
Struggling with a pair of Germans.
Yeah?
Lingerie.
What are we likely to run into?
Hey, I got a mother.  Jackson, you got a mother?
He's fast, Captain, I saw him.
Don't let your father's business infect your life.
We have records.  We have proof.  I'm sorry to be the one to have to tell you this, but it's going to get worse.  Now, if I were you, I would take that fellowship.
What family?  We never heard from them.  I sold her house for them, made them money.
Taking care of people isn't a growth enterprise, Mr Sims.  I hope you write that down in your report, I'd like your bosses to read it.
Is it a gift for your wife?  Are you getting a set together?
Good for her.
How do you know how to draw the red line anyway?
Yes I did- I sat across from her in a mall.  We ate together.  We ate, that's eating, sharing an important physical event.
I'm gonna call her.
Hang in there, man.
I admit nothing.
He's got that nervous talking thing.  I told him not to speak.
And above all, just because this happened gives you no right whatsoever...
It's too much pressure, it's not his crowd.
Confirm this with my office and my client.
Okay.
I just had a phone call.
You're going to take a big step, a big leap, and before you do, I just want one thing from you, miss.  You stand up straight and admit you're special.
Dad, I'm so glad I went.  Goodnight.
You're going.
Bon voyage.
But I found the money.
You're right.
Diane, I do have a history with this man, and it's not the greatest.  I see you so seldom, I'd really rather know about you.
Okay.  Oh, here's Ray.  Just talk to him because when you don't, your mouth turns down.
Yeah?
Thank you very much.
Yeah.  What a day.
Hmmm....
Eight.
I hereby surrender my duties as keymaster, give me a beer.
What?
Today is tomorrow.
Yeah, I've had it forever.  I used to have this thing with marking the words that I looked up.
Yeah?
I had a checklist in mind.  I thought that if babies were on the plane, the plane couldn't crash.  But all the babies were crying, and I thought they knew something I didn't.
Really?  Um... I... well... you're really turning me around here,
Wait, wait.  You told her about me?
Be friends?
Yeah.
Yeah?
Right.
Yeah.
This is so noble.
Yeah.
You're cold.
Here are some blankets.  This is a good song, this is a really good song.
I know.  Lloyd, let's not start putting things on this level.
We decided...
No, I don't, I don't.
Oh shit.
My father's guilty.  He lied to me, he lied to everybody.  I just left home... I need you.
I love you.  Please, I love you.
Okay, good, this is all very noble.
So when you hear the smoking sign go 'ding', you know everything's going to be okay.
Right, I'm just going to keep talking until that ding happens, which is going to be soon.
Okay. She's really pretty great, isn't she?
Spend as much time as possible with Diane before she leaves.
Go ahead, pick it up if you want.
I'm incarcerated, Lloyd!  I don't deserve to lose my daughter over this.  I don't deserve to have you as my go-between.  And I can't for the life of me figure out how she could choose to champion in mediocrity the way she flirts around you.
Just knowing a person like that exists, knowing that for a minute that she felt that and wrote 'I still can't help loving you'. That's gotta be a good thing, right?  That's gotta be a good thing.
So what's up?
Alright.  Key?
How you doin', brother?
I am happy to say that this bag is officially empty.
I got a question.  If you guys know so much about women, how come you're here at like the Gas 'n' sip on a Saturday night completely alone, drinking beers, no women anywhere?
War.
It's a beautiful city.
In Breslau.
He's important to my business.
I want him.  Come on, let's go inside, let's have a good time.
I don't know.  Soon.
Look -
Yeah.
How should I know?  It's broken. See what you can do.
Yeah?  Yeah, that'd be nice, let me get my coat.
We're losing the war, aren't we.
Whoever.  They're the ones.  They'd appreciate some kind of gesture from me.
The Jewish worker's salary, you pay it directly to the SS, not to the worker. He gets nothing.
Yes.
I think it's too late.
No?
Oskar, there are twelve hundred people who are alive because of you.  Look at them.
He was a metal press operator, quite skilled.
Of course he's stealing from me, we're in business together.  What is this?  I'm sitting here, suddenly everybody's talking like this is something bad.  We take from each other, we take from the Army, everybody uses everybody, it works out, everybody's happy.
Thanks, Dewey, but I was thinking I'd pull Jesse off...
They've broken their pattern.
Broad daylight, a crowded movie theatre. This is too much fun for one person.
That's smart.
Who is this?
Someone who wants to talk to you.
That's okay.
Why aren't you there?
Don't forget to set the alarm.
Look, yesterday wasn't my idea. That was all Gale and dollar signs and ratings.
Please, Cotton, dont do this.
Cotton, I've done nothing but help you.
Job hazard. Debbie Salt, stringer-- NEWSWEEK. Answer a few questions?
What are you doing here? I thought you had retired from field reporting?
And much richer as a result.
Youre all in this together?
Finish what my son started.
Don't ask what you can do. No coddling. Life rolls on status quo.
The forbidden subject.
I'll get my jacket.
No, it's not.
No. This is a set up.
But nobody wants to see that. Itll never go. Theyll rewrite you. You dont want that.
So you'll relieve me at 2:30...
Damned if I know. She ditched me.
Yeah, how can we help? Do you have any questions regarding the sequel of your life?
I find his work overwrought.
The way I see it. Well be arrested. Go to prison. Cash in on the home footage. Secure a book deal. If all goes as planned, our trial should coincide with the release of STAB II.
Tuitions expensive.
And an explanation is, of course, out of the question.
I know that.
What are we looking for?
Can we turn the light on?
Dewey, you and I would never make it.
..and as lonely as I am...
And Joel's pre-med.
Let's find out.
There's nothing. I'm coming down.
I'll give you one guess.
Yeah, well...you are the definition of mixed emotions. I really should hate you... I see your movie's getting good reviews.
Oh my God.
Hello?  Hello?
It's not a good idea, Hallie.
Her old boyfriend?
Closer than you think.
Gee, let me think. "Do you want to..." Is that the best you can do? Some tired hand me down rehash? Hey, pal, no one's gonna write a book about you. No movie rights. Nothing. I've been through this before and much better I might add.
It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your hand.
Shush.
I'm sorry, Sid, please. I never should have gone along with Gale. I know I'm stupid. I wish I had some good reason to give you but I'm just stupid. Please, Sid, don't be mad at me.
Well, yeah...she gave me a job. Freelance. It got me outta Woodsboro. I'm sorry about Cotton and yesterday. It was a bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea. Ah, shit, Sid, I'm fucked up. Sidney looks at him Long and hard, a smile slowly appearing.
I have this button I press. See? It insulates me. She mimes an air lock valve.
And that CICI chick wasn't that bad either but I'm really concerned about my safety now.
Who is this?
You seem to be familiar with the STAB movies. Here's how we play. I ask you a question. You get it right, your girlfriend lives. You answer wrong, she dies.
Closer than you think.
Well can you tell me if the woman in this picture looks familiar to you.
It may be Maureen Reynolds --
I wish that was all Miss Weathers, but there's more. The killer left a note.
Look, Miss Weathers, if there's a problem, give me a call. Here's my card. I'm always there.
In my fifteen years as a homicide detective I've never met a single soul as pushy and brazen as you are Miss Weathers.
Ben Damon. Christine Perkins. Sarah Darling. Tom Prinze. That's four, last time I learned how to count.
He killed Milton! The killer's  inside there! Oh God!  DEWEY! Dewey's in there too! He needs medical help! He's hurt!
You mean like, movie trilogies?
I'm a homicide detective, remember?  When you see what I see day in and day out, the violence that people do to each other, you get haunted. I think you know about that.
Catch him, or kill him.
That is for me to decide.  I need to talk to her Mr. Riley, she is a key element in this case.  I have a press conference in an hour, and I need to explain why there are four dead celebrities.
When it's a threat, you'll know it.
The killer called her.
And what made you think it was Sidney?
Well it's not safe for me up there either. The killer found me Dewey. He called me last night.
Do you want me to come with you Sid? I mean, remember what Randy said?
Help me Sid! The killer's got me!
Sid I can see you!
You said you'd never leave Woodsboro, 'The only place that's real!'  But now you're here. Not with me.  Dewey, I took care of you.  I waited until you were well.  I couldn't stay there, I mean, it's like dog years, one year in Woodsboro is like seven everywhere else.
Dewey, you're not just here because of that second rate K-Mart, straight-to-video version of me, are you?
And?
I happen to work for the police god dammit!
Fuck!
What?
Sid, this is detective Kincaid.
Well if you were in my shoes, dealing with those big Time Sunrise Studio producers like I do on a daily basis, you'd watch how quick your life goes from a Walt Disney picture to a Tobe Hooper flick.
What the hell are you doing?
I am Gale Weathers!
There a story in that building?
Gale Weathers would find a way.
Good twist.
Do you get any of my witty humor? I mean, you did play me for three movies.  His two hands, dingus.
Who?
Get real, that would make me a suspect!
I'm saying things got out of hand.  Maybe they did take advantage of her!.  Maybe the sad truth is, this is not the city for innocence.  No charges were brought.  And the bottom line is, Rina Reynolds wouldn't play by the rules.  You wanna get ahead in Hollywood, you gotta play the game, or go home.
Let's get out of here!
Oh my God, Angie Crick? From English class?
What character?  I'm Candy, the chick who gets killed second.  I'm only in two scenes!
I'm just saying, though. What if there's someone out there stalking actors? Huh? Then what?
W-what do you want?
Great. A spirited one. I'll be seeing you real soon Sidney. Real soon.
I don't want them, I want you!  It's simple. You show yourself, they survive, you run, they die!
Yes, hi I'm Laura, I'm a trained counselor. How can I help you.
It's called tact, you fuckrag.
You open your mouth and stupidity pours out.
Yeah, we just watched a few movies. Took a few notes. It was fun.
And did they really ever explain why Hannibal Lecter liked to eat people? Don't think so. You see, it's scarier when there's no motive, Sid.
No, it's not.
She looked dead. Still does.
Now that it's out of your system.
Hey, hey, it's just me.
The police say I scared him off. It wasn't me, Sid.
Ssshh... everything's gonna be okay. I promise.
Not so fast. We're gonna play a little game. It's called GUESS WHO JUST CALLED THE POLICE AND REPORTED YOUR SORRY MOTHERFUCKING ASS?
Gotta find me first, you pansy-assed Mama's boy.
Who is this?
I don't know.
Do I?
To apologize.
You're making popcorn?
Do you like scary movies?
You have to have a favorite.
Guess.
What do you think I said?
To talk.
You getting scared?
NO, YOU LISTEN, YOU LITTLE BITCH. IF YOU HANG UP ON ME AGAIN I'LL GUT YOU LIKE A FISH. UNDERSTAND?
TO SEE WHAT YOUR INSIDES LOOK LIKE.
Turn off the light.
Come on. It'll be fun.
Come on. It's you favorite scary movie, remember? He had a white mask, he stalked the baby-sitters.
Come on, yes you do.
YES!
No it's not. It was Jason.
I know who you are, ma'am. How's the eye?
You're not supposed to be here, ma'am.
Twenty-five, huh? In a demographic study I proved to be most popular amongst males, 11-24. I just missed you. Of course, you don't look a day over twelve, except in the upper torso area. Does the force require that you work out?
We haven't ruled out that possibil...
Afraid not.
How is everything?
What were you doing out here?
Twenty years ago I woulda said not a chance. But these kids today... damn if I know.
We haven't located her Dad yet.
What is it? Where's Casey?
When did that ever stop you? You can't sit on this. This is huge.
But it's so much easier when we make it up.
Yes, that's right.
And why would she do that?
Please, it's common knowledge. Her mother was a trollop.
Do you like scary movies, Sidney?
So who are you?
Right here.
If you hang up, you'll die just like your mother.
Can you knock?
No you didn't.
She's the Scream Queen.
Don't shoot. It's me.
Yeah, Casey and Steve were completely hollowed out. Takes a man to do something like that.
The why'd the police let him go?
Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.
He came to make up.
No, Sid.
How do you gut someone?
I'll be there by seven. I promise
Later.
Her dad's out of town. She's staying with us.
Just like old times, ain't it?
But if it wasn't Billy it could be anybody. He could be here at school right now.
Created by that little tabloid twit Gale Weathers.
And you believe it?
Come on, let's rock.
Oh, god...
With Stu, there's little time to stop and reflect. But sometimes before, to relax and get in the mood, I think about Grant Goodeve.
Grant Goodeve -- the oldest brother on EIGHT IS ENOUGH. Remember that show? He was the one who lived off alone. He would come around every now and then with his guitar and sing "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." He had all these brain dead sisters and that idiot brother from CHARLES IN CHARGE. God, I was in love with Grant, he was so hot. The show came on every day after school right during my puberty years. Grant Goodeve was very instrumental in my maturing as a woman.
Oh, Sidney. WHAT? A guy can talk tits til he's dead but the minute you mention an eight inch weenie. Watch out.
There's nothing that says I have to work with him.  If Somerset wants out, "goodbye."  Give it to me.
I'm in.
No, I haven't heard.
Yeah.
We figure you need all the tools you can get to fix up that piece of shit you call a house.
I read about it in the paper.
Where was the girl?
Who tied her down?  You or him?
Turn around.  Hands on your head!
Who are you?  What are you doing out here?
Why?
NO!
You know that's not true.
You only killed a bunch of innocent people so you could get your rocks off.  That's all.
Murderers like you?
Delusions of grandeur.
Sit back.
It's close.
What the fuck is going on here?!
For now.
Have you found any plastic scrapings near the stove or sink?  Near the food?
You always have to find one singular thing to focus on.  There's always one thing, and it may be as small as a speck of dust, but you find it and focus... till it's an exhausted possibility.
But, why would there be so many pieces in his stomach if it were nothing?  It must have been intentional.
Tonight.
Hello.
All day Saturday, and all day Sunday.  The murderer would want Gould to take his time.  To have to sit there and decide. Where do you make the first cut?  There's a gun in your face... but, what part of your body is expendable?
Forced what?
Even if they did, those photos were taken before forensics.
We're screwed.  He's fucking with us.
And you don't?
Oh, that's all.
Bullshit.
He doesn't have the desire somehow.  Our killer seems to have more purpose.  More purpose than Victor could ever conceive of.
It was my first one of these.  We were a secondary unit, and I was pretty shaky going in.  I was still considered a rookie.
I got him.  I got the son-of-a-bitch. See, I was doing really good up till then. Lots of street busts.  I've always had this weird luck... everything always went my way, but this was wild.  I got him with one shot... right between the eyes.  Next thing I know, the mayor's pinning a medal on me.  Picture in the paper, whole nine yards.
Oh, it's alright.
This is the job.  It's not an Easter egg hunt.
Just because the bastard has a library card, it doesn't make him Einstein.
If you want to know who's been reading Paradise Lost, Purgatory, and say... The Life and Time of Charlie Manson, the Bureau's computer will tell you.  It might give us a name.
I don't.  Neither do you.
We're focusing.
We need a warrant.
Think it through.  If we leave a hole like this, we'll never prosecute.  He'll walk.  We have to come up with some excuse for knocking on this door.
These murders are his masterwork.  His sermon to all of us.  To all us sinners.
How can you say that?  Especially after today?
You do your job...
Wrong!  I sympathize completely, because if you can't win... then, if you don't ignore everything and everyone around you, you... you become like John Doe.  It's easier to beat a child than it is to raise it, because it takes so much work to love.  You just have to make sure you don't stop to think about the abuse, and the damage, because you'll risk being sad.  Keep ignoring.
That part of me is dead.
One of two things will happen.  We're either going to get John Doe, or he'll finish his series of seven, and this case will go on for years.
What did you say?
I can't let you do this...
I don't know why... why now?
It surprises me.  It really does.
It's a hard place.
You have to put blinders on sometimes. Most times.
Talk to him about it.  He'll understand if you tell him how you feel.
You should look into private schools.
This is a done deal.  All but the paperwork.
That old goat still creakin' around?...Whyn't someone bury him?
An' she's got a beau! Kisses him, too!
Huh...? No...no water.
What right you got to be talkin' marriage to any decent woman...
By what you preach...none!
...as you have of findin' those girls alive by ridin' into 'em... I say we do it my way, Ethan...and that's an order!
That's all right, Captain...I don't need any formal invitation to kill a Comanch...
This an invite to a necktie party, Reverend?
How many, would you say?
Now mount up, son...
Yes, sir...Troop's about ten miles back...The Colonel sent me looking for you...
But...but captain, we can't possibly take the field tomorrow...for your own protection...
I remember...from always...At first I prayed to you...come and get me... Take me home...You didn't come...
These are my people...  Unnt-meah! Go! Go! <U>Please</U>!
Where's Scar, Mose...SCAR?
Ay-eh...Made out I was crazy...  Ate dirt...chewed grass...I fooled 'em, Ethan!...an' I got away...
You said there'd be a thousand dollar reward.
<U>Cheyenne</U>! What Cheyenne?
Huh...?  Sure I'm all right...
What's that?
What?
She ain't goin' back to her family, that's certain...not if she took off where the arrow points.
You breeds are all alike -- two drinks an'...
Livin' with Comanches ain't bein' alive...
You don't remember it, but I remember. That was your mother's scalp!
Not far from it...
They're not white any more -- they're <U>Comanche</U>!...Let's see the bodies...
You ever see it before...like mebbe on a dress Debbie wore?
Yours truly...  And he even has to write his full name...Martin Pauley...not even just <U>Martie</U>!...  I don't care if he <U>never</U> comes back!
Well I ain't one of 'em!
You talk like a feller might just as leave run around nekkid...
No, it wasn't...You mighta said you loved me...You mighta asked me to wait...At least that'd have been something...
It isn't fair...
You crazy?
I got to fetch her home...
Only if I'm dead!
We got two around that age...
Oh God, Tommi...
You'll never get away from me!
Oh, damnit!
We'll call for someone from town first thing in the morning.
Making our very own solstice fire.
Not a book fair.  I was signing autographs in a department store.
And two months later, we got married.  And all because of one sentence:  "With you, my life began and with you shall it end..."
Yeah... I have to go to town.
I haven't the slightest idea.
Old?!  Come look at this!  She has wounds.  Wounds on her head.  Like thrashes.  Or bites.
It's simply too dangerous here! But no, you always have to have it your way.
We loved each other once.  Have you forgotten that?
...So he's dictating you a new bestseller?  Whatever that is, it's not our son.
I wouldn't have made it by myself.
You know, I saw him sitting outside your gate...  Oh, I'm sorry, I'm forgetting my manners again!  I haven't even introduced myself yet. Hi, my name's Lindner. Karl Lindner.
Village gossip.  You're a real attraction here.
There is, of course, another possible explanation which I dearly hope is not the case.
Excuse us.  But do stop by for a visit sometime!  You are welcome anytime.
How could I fail to notice that! - I have to go...
I guess someone lost their key. You did get your tetanus shots, I hope?
And you are a Warwickshire shit-house.
You have the money?
The Queen has commanded, she loves a comedy and the Master of the Revels favours us.
See you in jail.
Romeo
Nothing comes.
And his ears.
Partners!
Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.
Of course not!
Without doubt he is completing it at this very moment.
Oh, that.
The Apothecary? Will, what is the story? Where is the shipwreck? How does the comedy end?
Every word.
Cut out my heart! Throw my liver to the dogs!
Yes. Nearly.  It's all locked safe in here. We need Ralph for the Pirate King. Good morning, Master Nol. You will have a nice little part.
We are about to embark on a great voyage.
By God, Will, if you do not, who does? Let us have pirates, clowns, and a happy ending, or we will send you back to Stratford to your wife!
Well, there's a pirate  In truth, I have not written a word.
Yes, that's good. Until he meets
Mercutiogood name.
Be still.
I am not so well-born.
From tomorrow, away in the country for three weeks! Is Master Shakespeare not handsome?
Your Majesty.
And I love poetry above all.
Oh, but they can!
There was a wager, I rememberas to whether a play can show the very truth and nature of love. I think you lost it today.  You are an eager boy. Did you like the play?
I have lost my gift.
I am, Master Shakespeare.
Sam! Do me a speech, do me a line.
"Ay me."
Is she obedient?
I like her.
But the plague
The same, alas.
A lowly player.
If they find you here they will kill you.
There is.
Oh
I must. Look-- how pale the window.
I must. I must
That's my line!
Oh, but it will end well for love?
My love is no lie. I have a wife, yes, and I cannot marry the daughter of Sir Robert de Lesseps. It needed no wife come from Stratford to tell you that. And yet you let me come to your bed.
I was the more deceived.
A comedy! What will my hero be but the saddest wretch in the kingdom, sick with love?
Sold in marriage and half way to America.
and thus unable to declare her love
So my lord? I speak with him every day.
Virginia?!
Lady Viola isyoung in the world. Your Majesty is wise in it. Nature and truth are the very enemies of playacting. I'll wager my fortune.
It is not my riding day, my lord.
Killed last night, in a tavern! Come, then, we'll say a prayer for his soul
He is speaking about a baggage we never even meet! What will be left in your purse when he meets his Juliet?
If you love her, you must do what she asks.
By coveting my property. I cannot shed blood in her house but I will cut your throat anon. You have a name?
A man, my lord?
Or maybe just phone out for a pizza?
I don't have time.
I don't have time to discuss it now. I don't care so long as he's not a freak.
It's true. A newspaper is paying for all this. A newspaper...
I just thought we should discuss it.
But not quite.
Just stop worrying.
No, it doesn't. I tried to let it worry me but it won't. I've worked on that paper for three years. There is a pensioner's terror ordeal on page six every day. Every day. Maybe when I'm a pensioner it'll worry me.
You're not eating.
Not eating like you used to, that's what.
Looking for you? Yes.
Your friends.
It doesn't neccessarily matter. They don't even know who those people are, and even if they did, they have nothing to connect them with us, nothing at all.
Yeah, I was phoning your mother.
Oh, no, no, no. Don't let it worry you. Not at all. It's probably for the best.
Not at all.
I don't know anything about it.
Take another look at these two.
What?
No, not any more. I just wondered if it would surprise you.
Oh, no problems. Don't worry.
Yes, thanks.
For the flat.
I don't know. He sounded Swedish. Do you know any Swedish men? Maybe it was just the emotion.
What? Oh, yeah, sure, if you want. I tell you, every letter this guy writes to you is the same: they all begin like pure love and descend into open pornography. I dream of your thighs, the soft touch of your white skin leading me in desire, while I, aroused and inflamed --'
Alex.
Not usually this drunk.
So I gathered.
His car's still there.
So what's wrong with that?
What? What's wrong?
I'm just looking.
It's not every day I find a story in my own flat.
What?
OK.
I don't know why we couldn't stuff it in a mattress or put it under the floor like any normal human being. We could have hid it in the fridge.
You were magnificent.
It tastes different.
Don't you?
Oh, good.
Forget it -- he'll come down.
Yes, of course. Why wouldn't I be?
Let him go. Let him take it all.
What about?
Who said there were four?
Yes, absolutely.
I doubt it. And these two other people, did they hear anything?
Yes.
That was stressful. I found that stressful.
And you need your sleep.
Oh, don't be so coy, dear. You're going to Rio.
Sorry?
Eh --
Yes, sir.
I'm boring?
What happened to that guy?
I'd be delighted.
Yeah. Well, maybe I'll change it.
No.
Did he sound upset?
You know about it?
I'm sorry, I've never seen any of them.
Do you think you have a good memory for faces?
Chicken salad, Devra!
No, it's a very groovy girl.
I don't know. He's a hairdresser.
It's just -- fabulous.  Think you could do anything for me?
Lester, don't you think that uhh --
What do you expect me to do about it?
Why would I like to know if there's nothing I can do about it, goddammit --
Yes and you don't have to be sarcastic about it, that's a beautiful thing he's doing -- some people do more than go to the beauty parlor and shop at Saks --
No.
I'll be right back, it's just that this girl is a different girl... she has attacks.
What?
You're looking great, baby.
I wouldn't say so if I didn't.
And I certainly wouldn't tell Lester.
Hello, George.
Well she...
Holy Christ. You want to get us killed?
Nobody can hear it.
I guess so.
Okay.
No thanks.
Yeah.
Gee, this is great.
Why do you wanna know so bad?
In fact, I don't think I've ever been to a beauty parlor in my whole life.
I am not like my mother!
Buffums?
Jill's really great, isn't she?
He's a very private person, actually.
No, thanks.
Probably the bathroom.
What?
You did, didn't you?
-- this guy with Jill.
-- what?
No you didn't.
You were great.
-- oh I thought you were --
Look who's talking.
Not me, pal.
Why?
-- well you better go after her.
Lester's on his way.
No --
Lester's left Felicia. He's taking me to Acapulco on the five o'clock flight. He's asked me to marry him.
Don't leave me...
Wash her.
-- why did you come in today?
-- c'mon, I'll get you home...
That's too bad.
Great, great. I hope you make it.
What's gonna happen?
Well, like what?
George, I don't --
Nobody's gonna get you but me!
Fine. How are you?
What?
How?
I thought you said you were at the epitome of your life.
Of course I like children.
I'm around you and I like you, don't I?
What!
Okay, baby. Okay...
Hey, baby, what's happening?
Hello.
Where's your car?
-- she's a very compulsive girl.
Oh, Christ.
I don't want to be a fool!... I want to look them in the eye and say, I know!
-- tell me something -- did you talk about me?
-- A wash and set.
Oh yeah.
When?
What about, tonight?
Oh, hey...
I don't know what to...
Your hair looks -- well fabulous.
Isn't that bad for it?
Layered?
Well, what?
Now wait a minute...
But...
Didn't they tell you?
Oh, fuck, Lester, how should I know?
No thanks.
Wasn't sure it was you.
I... uh... I... uh... can't.
I'll call you back.
Okay, okay...
Yeah, yeah -- 'bye.
Is that right?
Is that right?
George is going to open a shop.
Who do you think I was talking to?
That's not very logical, Lester.
Lester, this is my friend Jill and this is Johnny Pope.
You know what's wrong.
Yes, Jackie Shawn, my wi -- Felicia.
What did you do?
No, it sounds very sexy -- did you just stay by the sink all that time?
I see. You mean he just sort of fucks you.
-- these bastards have me hemmed in.
You mean when are you going to Egypt?
We can't really leave that poor man here alone.
I'm telling you he won't know the difference.
-- just wonderful.
No.
Well... that's wonderful -- I'll stop by there for a drink.
Yes?
You mean they ate each other up?
Do you feel bad?
Yes, Dad.
I'm not supposed to.
Tony's the little boy who lives in my mouth.
Does your Mum and Dad know about Tony?
Is there something bad here?
Yeah, I guess so.  Anyway, there's hardly anybody to play with around here.
All right.
Okay, Mom.
Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.
Danny, come here!
No.
Mommy saying, 'Wake up, wake up, wake up Danny, wake up.'
Where does he go?
Yes.
Thank you.
Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, he seems absolutely fine now, but you should have seen him.
Mrs. Torrance, most of the time these episodes with kids are never explained.  They are brought on by emotional factors, and they rarely occur again.
Did Tony's first appearance happen to coincide with your arrival here?
Well it's just one of those things. You know... purely an accident, um. My husband had oh... been drinking, and he came home about three hours late, so he wasn't exactly in the greatest mood that night.  And well Danny had scattered some of his school papers all over the room... and my husband grabbed his arm, you know, and pulled him away from them. It's...it's just the sort of thing you do a hundred times with a child - you know, in a park or on the streets - but on this particular occasion my husband just... used too much strength and he injured Danny's arm.
Awfully nice of you to say.  Of course I intend to change my jacket this evening before the fish and goose soiree.
Fine.
Why no, sir.  I don't believe so.
Eh... Mr. Grady... weren't you once the caretaker here?
A nigger.
Your son has a very great talent. I don't think you are aware how great it is, but he is attempting to use that very talent against your will.
There's nothing I look forward to with the greater pleasure, Mr. Grady.
Hallo.  My name's Dick Halloran. I'm the Head Chef up at the Overlook Hotel.
It will be a pleasure.  Right this way Mrs. Torrance.
Doc.  You called Danny 'Doc' twice just now.
Yeah.  We call him Doc sometimes, you know, like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.  But how did you know that?
Pleased to meet you.
Now I'm awfully glad you asked me that, Lloyd, because I just happen to have two twenties and two tens right here in my wallet.  I was afraid they were going to be there until next April.  So here's what: you slip me a bottle of Bourbon, a glass and some ice.  You can do that, can't you, Lloyd?  You're not to busy, are you?
Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance.
Thank you for saying so.
Yeah.
Yeah... that's all it is.
No, nothing at all.
You think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
I'm not going to hurt you.
Stop swinging the bat.
Go away.
Wendy...
Oh, well - come on in Jack.
Well...
Well, that sounds fine to me.
Not for me.
I'm intrigued.
shut in together over long periods of time.
Oh!
Thank you, Susie.
Hi.
Blue. This blue.
Come on, Jane- it was Brady's idea. I couldn't stop him.
What do you expect, when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed?
That's what my sister says, too. Pretty soon I'm going to start checking the mirror to see if I'm turning green.
What's that?
Hey, take it easy. I know how you feel.
Okay, okay. Dwight Evans.
Let the boy finish the game, Nan.
A bunch of men getting ready to pretend they're Clint Eastwood... Marty, didn't anybody ever tell you that the only monsters are in comic books and drive-in movies?
And the fireworks. Hand me that box, Marty.
I don't get you.
A tracer. You'll like it.
You're welcome a million, Marty. Stick 'em in the bushes for now.
I don't know. But I know you didn't see any werewolf the other night, Marty. You had a dream, that's all. An extremely realistic nightmare brought on by what's been happening in this town.
Marty, the moon wasn't even full!
-and Babcock, I remember. Now go on!
Oh?
Yes, Mary?
Hey, Sisters.  Are you going in there?
Mary Robert, don't panic.  Remember what we talked about?  Experience?
That used to be true, Vince.  I was with you.  But something happened.  And I'm different now.  Real--different.  I've had, well, you might call it -- a religious experience.  And I've got just two words for you.  And those two words are...
I know.  It's ancient.
That man -- who is he?
Pay attention...
Enough jabber.
I knew that.
You know?  About me?  About everything?
Three years.  Sister.
She won't?  Why not?
What?
This is your neighborhood.  Your turf. You should get to know 'em.
Honey.
Keep moving!
I don't know, some people just don't like nuns.  I wish I had a ruler.
Mary Robert, I've watched you.  You never really sing.  You whisper. Nothing comes out.
Oh no.  We'll always be together.
Very well.
What?
Would you like that?
Do your recall the words of Saint Peter, in Ecciesiastes 1:27?  He spoke unto a wastrel youth.  He said, "Take up thy task, and know ye the path of contentment."
Good.  Mary Patrick, I need you in the office.  Mary Clarence, carry on.
I don't believe we have anything to say to each other.
I know!  I'm sorry   I didn't mean for it to happen!  And I was the one they were shooting at!
Through blasphemy?  You have corrupted the entire choir!
What do you mean?
I have submitted my resignation to Bishop O'Hara.  Privately.  I have asked to be relocated as soon as possible.
I'm a Christian.
Don't push it.
Get a stenographer.
Not again.  You can't keep calling. Somebody's going to catch on to where you are.
Calm down.  Look, I didn't want to tell you this, but we've had some problems with our protection program lately.
What if I was Vince?  You'd be dead right now.  What are you doing giving interviews on TV?
Yeah.  You look... great.  I mean it..
Me too.
How?
That depends.  Sisters, you don't know this, but Reverend Mother's been making all sorts of noises about resigning. That's bad news.  I don't know if we could sing, if we thought that was true.
I don't know.  There's only one way to be absolutely sure.
Hail, Mary.
It's a bluff, Vince.
She's a broad!  Got it!  Just some broad!
Forget her!  We got the one we need! Step on it!
Is it worth it?  A lot of witnesses here.
But -- why would anyone kidnap a nun?
That was exciting!
Yes -- two men -- and they had guns.
She's our inspiration!
A Benedictine.
Christy.
Yes?
I know.
I love you, Chris.  I always will.  I gave you so much.  My time.  My affection.  A big-time career.  And how do you repay me?  What's the thanks I get?  Where's the loyalty, huh?  Where's the love?
I fired upon the Horseman and the bullet did nothing.
Excuse me?
What are you spying on?
... Brom Bones...
You cannot do this.  I am a man of God!
Pardon me?
Of course.  You want them... it shall not take long.  Wait here.
Have they nothing to fear presently?
And, <u>with</u> disrespect, Constable, if jails and courts overflow, it is testimony to success, not failure.
Not Liberalism.  Equanimity.
I shall, gladly.
More than enough, actually.  I beg you, no more, please.
How could he?
Up.
The Western Woods.
Listen.
No crickets or cicadas calling.  No bird songs.
True enough.
And it now belongs to you, according to Baltus.  I heard him say it.
But, if the farm is not mine, who stole it away?
Yes.  I rode with him on payment days.
It is nothing.  She comes to read books, so her father will not find her.  It is absolutely nothing.
Take me with you.  There's nothing left for me here.
Lady Van Tassel...
I doubt that's the end.
Do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men's beds?
Excuse me... I should apologize.  I, um... I... have no great love of...
Which may explain his temperament. To have asked twice means the answer was "no" at least once.
Poets have silly notions about plants and bodily secretions.
I insist that you have it.
No stone may be left unturned.  It may appear harsh...
The child she carried was eight months grown at least... near to birthing.  The sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly.
I have no solution for its meaning yet, but I could not just ignore it.
What?
Katrina.  Why do you follow?
I'm drawing bad blood from the wound.
What would you have me believe?
Speak the words, Constable.  What is stopping you?  What has happened to your ability to transcend sentimentality?
Doctor, he is awake.
She did not do it... please listen...
No, sir, please... she is innocent...
No.
You got any money?
Well, I'm gonna pay you today for this comin' week, so you'll have some walkin' around money. When you get off this evenin' you better go buy some toothpaste and cleanin' up supplies to have back there. Some hard candy and some magazines. Somethin' to keep you busy at night.
Scooter, let's me and you go over to Dairy Queen and pick up a few things for lunchtime.
No, don't guess I do.  Scooter, good to meet you.  This is him, the one I talked to you about on the phone. Now like I said, I'll understand if you get nervous about it. I'm not gonna lie to you now, he did get in that trouble but then he was real young.
He's a regular whiz at it. That's all he did when he was a kid.
Good to know you, Karl.
What you got that's good to eat?
French-fried potaters.
How fer you going with them sacks full of warsh?
Don't say nothin' about that boy.
I just feel sorry for the poor thing.
He does make some funny noises.
But honey, I'll be good. I promise. I love you sweetie. I'm just tryin' to help these two be part of things.
Don't tell me what to do.
Sure. It sounded like a number one tune all right.
Shhhh! This is the national anthem.
What exactly do you mean by that? I don't understand.
Different ones. One's the Bible. One of 'ems a book on Christmas. One of 'ems how to be a carpenter.
Ain't got nowhere to set 'em down.
Yeah.
I reckon I feel all right.
My mother's dead. My daddy's s'posed to be around still. He don't want to have nothin' to do with me though.
He ort not to talk that away to you neither. He ain't no count. He's mean to you and your mama.  Yore mama and that feller that's carryin' me to get somethin' d'eat's gonna be back here directly.
I reckon it tastes pretty good to me.
Yeah, I reckon they did. Hit like to tore me up when I read about that pore little cripple boy.
Yeah, I recollect it.
They ort to. You're a good boy.
That's real good. You ort not to if ye ain't married to somebody. Bible tells you that much. Hit tells some things that don't seem right too, I reckon. I guess a feller ort to foller it close as he can, though.  You don't touch yourself, do you?
My daddy come to the shed out back and got me and said throw this here away and handed me a towel with somethin' in it. I went for the trash barrel there and opened up the towel to see 'cause they was a noise and somethin' movin' in it. Hit was bloody-like around that towel. Hit was a little ol' bitty baby, no bigger than a squirrel.
I don't reckon I know. I ain't found no way yet and I'm three or four times as old as you. Might be that's just the way folks is.
Make believin' always made me feel good too from time to time.
Is that right?
We'll be on teams, me and you?
I knowed you'd be here.  What are you a-doin' digging with that stob?
Mama?
He's lyin' Mama. He ain't gonna do better.
Well, when you like pricing items as much as I do, I guess it's just bound to happen sooner or later.
You better go get 'em.
I reckon.
He's a-carryin' me to look fer work in Millsburg where I was borned.
Yes sir.
I'll be dog.
Thank ye.  I'm just getting around to tellin' you, but I fixed your warshin' machine.
Naw, I don't believe you have. I don't reckon I never been in here. This store didn't used to be here.
I's horned and raised here up till I's twelve year old.
What's that you say?
Not really to speak of.
I've heard it said that way.
I wouldn't never hurt them.
I ain't read 'em yet except two or three of 'em. I can't understand a lot of what I try to read. My mind, hit wonders off to somethin' else when I try to read.
That dern Doyle is in a bad way again with that drinkin' and bein' mean to folks. Will you give me your word you'll do it?
I don't reckon you have to go with women to be a daddy to a boy.  You've been real square dealin' with me. The Bible says two men ort not lay together. But I'll bet you the Good Lord wouldn't send nobody like you to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades.  That boy lives inside of his own heart. Hits an awful big place. You take care of that boy.
Frank's just crazy about him. He likes the way he talks. He helped him carry home the clean laundry.
Hey Karl, you know what? Melinda was voted employee of the month at the Dollar Store last February. Isn't that somethin'?
That's very sweet of you Vaughan. We care about you, too. Don't we y'all?
Nice to meet you. I'm Marsha Dwiggins and this is Theresa Evans. She's here to take the pictures.
No thank you.
How am I going to conduct an interview if I can't ask him any questions?
We've got some paperwork to take care of. Pretty soon. Don't worry, you won't run into him in the parking lot.
I think everybody at the store knows that already. They always talk about it. Maureen Ledbetter told a awful story about why you ain't allowed over at the First Baptist Church no more.
Wonderful. When your next book is published, maybe you could come into the store and do a signing. I'm sure we could get a lot of people to show up.
Three's a crowd. Yes, I'm aware of that. But I have to keep an eye on Mr. Benjamin wherever he goes. To make sure he doesn't get himself into trouble.
Actually, I'm his father.
I confess.
American literature. What else?
Visions of Utopia in Nineteenth-Century American Fiction.
That's the subject of my last chapter.
Which explains why this hasn't been the easiest summer of my life.
Yeah, well, I've sort of been out of commission.  How's Melville?
Okay. I'll read it tonight and call you tomorrow.  It doesn't seem to be too long.
What's that, Sol?
Uh, sure, Sol. Anything you say. Instead of saying, "One corned beef sandwich," and then, "Another corned beef sandwich," I'll say, "Two corned beef sandwiches."
Yeah, I did.
Well, let's not exaggerate. I take pictures. You line up what you want in the viewfinder and click the shutter. No need to mess around with all that artisto crap.
It's Ellen. Look at her. Look at my sweet darling.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry too.  It took me three years to save up those five thousand bucks, and now I'm broke. I can't hardly pay for this beer. Not to speak of having my credibility destroyed. Do you understand what I'm saying? My credibility. So yeah, I'm sorry, too. About as sorry as I've ever been in my whole fucking life.
Cops? You mean they nabbed those cruds?
We'd better be. I haven't spent a night out of Brooklyn in fourteen years, and I'm not about to break my record now. Besides, I've got to be on my corner at eight sharp tomorrow morning.
I mean, it's a good story.
You always were a son-of-a-bitch, weren't you? A little weasel with a quick, dirty mouth.
Don't rush me, okay? You're jumping to conclusions before I've even said anything.  And besides, it's not for me.  It's for our daughter.
It was over with Bill before you ever came home. Maybe you don't remember it now, but you were pretty hot to see me back then.
Who the hell knows?  He dropped out of sight fifteen years ago.
You're a cold-hearted bastard, aren't you? How'd you ever get so mean, Auggie?
Look, I'm not saying you don't have a daughter. It's just that she's not my daughter.
And what's that supposed to mean?
Dream on, Auggie. She'll be lucky to make it to her nineteenth birthday.
I'm sorry, baby. I can't help it.
I almost got married once.
She made a play for me after I got back, but her glass eye kept interfering with my concentration. Every time we got into a clinch, I'd start thinking about that hole in her head, that empty socket with the glass eye in it. An eye that couldn't see, an eye that couldn't shed any tears. The minute I started thinking about it, Mr. Johnson would get all soft and small. And I can't see getting married if Mr. Johnson isn't going to be in tiptop shape.
I try not to, anyway. It's better for your health. I mean, look at you, Vincent. You're the guy with the wife and three kids and the ranch house on Long Island. You're the guy with the white shoes and the white Caddy and the white shag carpet. But you've had two heart attacks, and I'm still waiting for my first.
It's the law that's buying. That's what's so beautiful about it. I mean, when was the last time you heard of a judge sending himself to jail?
Seventeen? I remember when I was seventeen. Christ, I was one little whacked-out son-of-a-bitch when I was seventeen. Is that what you are, son? One little whacked-out crazy fella?
Good. Keep it up, and maybe one day you'll grow up and become a great man like me.
For me? And what am I supposed to do with a paper bag?
Huh?
And these?
Thanks for the tip.
I'm telling you. I don't know anyone named Thomas.
As far as I know, he went back to his parents.
And his parents?
I was about to get run over by a car, and your nephew pulled me back. He saved my life.  I sensed he was in trouble, so I offered to put him up for a few days. Maybe I should have pressed him a little more, I don't know. I feel pretty stupid about it now.
And you told your nephew about it?
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
I'm working on a sketch. That old garage of yours is so rundown, it's kind of interesting.
It'll cost you five bucks.
Not a one.
It was just a thought.
What's your offer?
You know, health insurance, dental plan, paid vacation. It's not fun being exploited. Workers have to stand up for their rights.
I don't know. I try. Every day I keep on trying, but it's no easy task for a man to change his nature.  I'm off the booze, though. Haven't had a drop in six years. And now I've got me a wife. Doreen. Best damned woman I've ever known.  And a little boy, too. Cyrus Junior.  So things have definitely improved since I got fitted with this hook. If I can just turn this goddamn garage around, I'll be in pretty good shape.
And this one, in case you haven't guessed, is Junior.
Say hi to Paul.
Well, you and Junior have the same name, too, don't you?
Are you making fun of me? I won't be mocked. Do you hear me? I won't let no punk kid stand there and mock me!
It's me, honey. It's Mom.
Well what?
No, wait. You can't just walk off.  You saved my life.
Come on. At least let me buy you a cup of coffee.
Just one bottle. I believe in moderation.
That's true. But I also owe you something, and I'm not sure that buying you a hamburger is going to do the job.  What is it? Family problems? Money problems?
In Manhattan?
I'm not "people." I'm just me. And I do whatever I goddamn want to do. Got it?
Nice drawing. Did you do that?
Is your father an artist?
He's dead?
What time is it?
I'm a teenager. All teenagers are clumsy. It's because we're still growing. We don't know where our bodies end and the world begins.
It sounds like our time is up, doesn't it?
No hard feelings, okay? It's a small place, and I can't get my work done with you around.
Business appointment. I'm seeing my broker at three o'clock.
Maybe. Or maybe it's the other people who don't belong.
Fair enough. We wouldn't want to get carried away, would we?  Now call your aunt Em and let her know you're alive.
What time did you get to bed last night?
You work too hard, you know that?
That's logical. And if you don't sleep, you don't need a bed. Saves you money, too.  So what's this story you're working on, anyway?
The inspiration.
No way.
It's my birthday. I'm seventeen years old  as of forty-seven minutes ago, and I think I should celebrate having made it this far.
Absolutely. We would be honored.
Nice try. You had me going for a second, but no ... no writer would ever do a thing like that.  Would he?
That's just it. I didn't think. I just did it.
Six thousand dollars. Five thousand eight hundred and fourteen dollars, to be exact.
That's it. In a nutshell.
No way. There's no way I'm giving that money back. It's my money now.
It was more complicated than that. There was a reason.
I suppose so. He never told me about it.
I'm not going to do it.
I was going to tell him ... but in my own time. In my own time... .
Hot coffee or iced coffee?
What are you sellin' 'em for? Why don't we start there.
...<u>might</u> do the same.  I have to warn you 'bout that, chief.  I'm not screwed together like I used to be.
Carl Heine's type.
No bits of bone, no particles of scalp, no strands of hair?
You don't.
I'm a hemotologist, not a detective.
So the defendant knew the deceased, your son, even then.
In the war.  Europe, I believe. They could hardly send him to the Pacific, could they?
You done your math right.
Couldn't get on the boat.  I'd just <u>shoot</u> the feller.  <u>Then</u> tie up, throw him inta th' drink.  And skip bein' the first gill-netter in history to make a successful forced boarding.
So, five hours.  Plenty of time for a call.  He was 'excited', you say. In the sense of being 'overjoyed'.
Up in the air?  Was <u>that</u> your reaction?
Why not?
I did.  But the jury won't s...
Nossir.  I'd gone to tell the wid... to tell Mrs. Heine.
And the last...?
You bet.  And if Miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off, he coulda left this line behind on Carl's boat.
Objection, asking the witness to speculate.
Objection!
Objection!  Speculation.
But isn't the <u>truth</u> that there are <u>several</u> other ways to explain <u>each</u> of these twelve pieces.
Carl Heine came.
Should have told 'everything'. Meaning, you should have told the <u>truth</u>.
Some seaman's loast report. Stuffed in a cabinet, good as lost forever.  No one knows.
Three kids.  What's she going to do?
The sheriff and the deputy and I inspected the deck closely.  We found a small fracture in the wood of the gunnel.  Just below the mast.
I'll take two.  One for later.
It's a rare thing.  Takes a turning point.
Naw, I had that around for a while.
I should show them an American?
A little.  Yes.  You have to wonder.
He's done some on-the-spot refit- ting.  You could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the D-6.
No.
Possible.  But not darn likely.
Even though a D-6 is too big, and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in.  Which makes it a peculiar choice. For a spare.
Obviously.
But you are <u>certain</u> that he died by drowning.
I wouldn't say encouraged.
He had no reason to.
I...see.  I'm not sure I quite get your...point...
Spirit?                          Oh!  You mean "AQ"..."aggressive qualities"?
I thought I made it clear I don't want any drinking in this outfit.
Thank you ever so.
Fresh!
Now cut that out, girls-none of that rough talk.  They went to a conservatory.
A what?
Manhattans?  This time of night?
Dentist?  We been out of work for four months - and you want to blow your first week's pay on your teeth?
How can you be so selfish?  We owe back rent - we're in four eighty-nine bucks to Moe's Delicatessen - we're being sued by three Chinese lawyers because our check bounced at the laundry - we've borrowed money from every girl in the line -
No we're not.
Jerry-boy - why do you have to paint everything so black? Suppose you get hit by a truck? Suppose the stock market crashes?
So I had to rush him to the hospital and give him a transfusion...  Right?
- Type O.
No - nothing.  Besides, it's none of our business if you guys want to knock each other off -
You better come help me.
Then pull the emergency brake!
We can get a job with another band. A male band.
Of course, you're not.  I'm going.
No.  I'm going to be on that boat with Sugar.
That's right.
I'm engaged.
Why not?  He keeps marrying girls all the time!
His mother - we need her approval.  But I'm not worried - because I don't smoke.
Then we'll get a quick annulment - he'll make a nice settlement on me - I'll have those alimony checks coming in every month -
But Joe - this may be my last chance to marry a millionaire!
Daphne got a proposal tonight.
So?  It's going to break Sugar's heart when she finds out I'm not a millionaire.  That's life.  You can't make an omelette without breaking an egg.
There's our shaving stuff - and there's Sugar.
Get me Room 414.
That's when I was a saxophone player. Now I'm a millionaire.
Yeah - lets shove off.
Tell him you're going to elope with him.
I'm Sugar Cane.
I don't want you to think that I'm a drinker. I can stop any time I want to - only I don't want to.  Especially when I'm blue.
If it hadn't been for you, they would have kicked me off the train.  I'd be out there in the middle of nowhere, sitting on my ukulele.
Stay as long as you'd like.
I'm fine.
You better put on the lights. I can't see what I'm doing.
I may spill something.
What's the surprise?
When?
Thank you, Daphne.
Come on, Daphne.
If I'd been watching my step, I never would have met him.  Wait till I tell Josephine.
Yes.  He wants me to have supper with him - on his yacht - he's going to pick me up at the pier.
I know what you need - a slug of bourbon.
Oh - those.  I don't know.  Mice?
The Florida job?
You're the wrong shape.  Goodbye.
I am Cinderella the Second.
Goodbye?
Osgood - I can't get married in your mother's dress.  She and I - we' not built the same way.
But you don't understand!  I'm a MAN!
Just the two of you?  What about the crew?
We won't breathe a word.
Oh, it's you!  You got a lot of nerve -
The minute we get a job, I'm going to take you out to the swellest restaurant -
It's three weeks in Florida -
Yes, Joe.
My car?  Why, you -
Nellie, get me long distance.  What is it?
It's not the backs that worry me.
No - funerals.
There are two things I will not put up with during working hours.  One is liquor - and the other one is men.
Oh.
I used to sing with male bands. But I can't afford it any more.
You see, I have this thing about saxophone players.
Especially tenor sax.  I don't know what it is, but they just curdle me.  All they have to do is play eight bars of "Come to Me My Melancholy Baby" - and my spine turns to custard, and I get goose-pimply all over - and I come to them.
You don't know what they're like. You fall for them and you love 'em - you think it's going to be the biggest thing since the Graf Zeppelin - and the next thing you know they're borrowing money from you and spending it on other dames and betting on the horses -
I can tell you one thing - it's not going to happen to me again.  Ever. I'm tired of getting the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
Well, now that you've mentioned it -
Not very likely.
Would you mind moving just a little? You're blocking my view.
Up, up, up.
For your own amusement?
Oh.  Well, I guess some like it hot.  But personally, I prefer classical music.
- riding to hounds -
You know, it's amazing we never ran into each other before.  I'm sure I would have remembered anybody as attractive as you.
Tonight?
It's on the account of the shells. That's my hobby.
If it's at all possible -
Shells?  Whatever for?
Well, you know how those millionaires are.  These came for you.
Oh, Josephine - just imagine - me, Sugar Kowalczyk, from Sandusky, Ohio, on a millionaire's yacht.  If my mother could only see me now -
Looks like they're on the wrong track.
Well, that depends - on whether you're coming or going - I mean, normally the aft is on the other side of the stern - and that's the bridge - so you can get from one side of the boat to the other - how about a glass of champagne?
Yes - that's our hurricane cellar.
Oh - a member of the herring family.
I'll say.  I had two ponies drowned under me.
Yea, of course.  Now where could they have put it?  On Thursdays, I'm sort of lost around here.
Nothing at all?
Talk about sad.
You poor, poor boy.
Thanks just the same.
If I ever found a girl that could - I'd marry her like that.
It's like smoking without inhaling.
Thank you.
Oh, you know - Junior League - charity bazaars - I used to sell kisses for the Milk Fund.
Good morning.
I'm going to see him again tonight - and every night - I think he's going to propose to me - as soon as he gets up his nerve.
Not always.  But I want you to know I'm very grateful for what you did for me.
Well, anchors aweigh, you have a bon voyage.  And if you need an orchestra to play at your wedding, we'll be through here in a couple of weeks.
How can I?  No matter where I go, there'll always be a Shell station on the corner.  I'll bring this back when it's empty.
I told you - I'm not very bright.
That's because I've been on the wagon.
Big joke.  Who's the rap this time?
Me?  I'm just a customer here.
If you want to, you can call your lawyer.
Goodbye, Charlie.
Well, we all got to go sometime.
What is it, Spats?  What do you want here?
Oh, shut up and be happy. Its always this or that. Youre never happy, you frowny-faced Grumplestilskin.
When I freaked out at the pub?  That was nothing, just nerves. Dont worry about it.
Actually, I do.
Or Kat....
I knew you were still seeing someone else when we finally got together. I never in a million years would have dreamt it was Jeffrey.
Why, with you.
It was just after we moved here. My little girls got in a fight over Tony Pee-Pants and they havent made up since.
Mom, please.
Im a hooker.
Other than, hes shagging your exgirlfriend?
And you do now?
No, tell me.
Um, news flash: I dont give a shit.
Kat.
Oh, yeah.  So we split it. You know, as in share. People do that.
I dont know.
Its okay. Hell, Ive never paid for it. But please dont feel like you have to explain yourself to me.
Im desperate to start but I dont have an addictive personality. Except for approval. That, I cant get enough of.
This happened to you?
Shampoo, got it!
First of all, its never out of the blue. And second of all--
I guess so.
Show me.
Ive got this bad taste in my mouth. What is it? I think its the words: morally repugnant.
We kissed. Made out a little. Then you passed out.
Of course not. How...how could it be? Nothing happened.
Not dollars. Pounds.
Oh, cut the crap!
Its my job.
Desperation?
He bled a bunch, but no, there was no peeing.
Go ahead, Kat. Hate me. You were running out of steam on the whole Jeffrey thing. Maybe now youll be able to hold onto this just long enough to ruin your next relationship.
I wasnt saving you from him. I was saving you from yourself.
Ahoy!
I havent thought about that in years.
At least somebodys using the damn thing.  I was gonna fix her up but we took one trip and the kids fought so much, we never launched her again.
What would you say if I told you I was a member of an elite task force employed to safeguard our nations most precious resource: your daughter.
I say that feeling compelled to do the opposite of your parents is as enslaving as emulating them.
Will do.
It was the best thing I ever been to, Miss Johnson!
You know, that was a good thing you did for Clarence, in class today. I believed his story, but I was afraid the other children wouldn't...
But where is my daddy!?
Yes, mam...
What do that mean?
She was dirty and wet...
No, Miss Johnson...
Charlie, just because a man and his family are colored, you--
You would do that, wouldn't you?
Looks that way, son. Guess the cold done drove most of 'em down to the big water country -- but if there's one left out here -- we gotta find him.
You oughta be tired, too, Sounder. That possum shore whipped the hell outta you tonight!
Yes, sir -- I learn to write a little bit, and I can read a lot--
Naww -- he'll come back to you, soon as his wounds heal. This cake shore is tasty, son.
I think so...
Got it hurt in a dynamite blast, son. The dirty dogs had no more use for me, so they let me have time off my sentence, and let me come home.
Where was you, Daddy?
Come here, son...
Mornin', Daddy...
Well, ain't you gon' open and read it for us?
Now wait justa minute! You don't tell me what you ain't gonna do! I tell you! I say, you goin' to that school, you goin'! You hear me!
My father taught me...
Yes, David...
David!
Then why don't he holler like he usta?
Where all meat come from -- now git yourself washed up and be snappy about it -- you got six miles ahead of you to that school.
Same as we -- they pray.
'Bye, son -- I won't be gone long.
No, ma'am...  Mama, I wanted Mrs. Boatwright to find out where Daddy is, so me and Sounder can go see him.
I can do it, Mama -- you know that. In the Bible stories you read to us, everybody's always goin' on a long journey. Jacob goes into a strange land where his uncle is and he don't even know where he lives, but he finds him. Everybody finds what they supposed to find.
Yes, son. You better get back to bed.
I guess they musta sent 'im to another camp.
Miss Johnson must be a real kindly lady.
He can't get up, Mama!
Yes, ma'm...
If I tell you I didn't, David, that's what I mean.
I'm used to it.
Hi, Mrs. Boatwright...  I'm sorry 'bout the way I acted the other day, Miss Boatwright.
And if they saw me pitch the way I did today -- they'd hire me just to strike out Babe Ruth!
They probly thought you was crazy.
What did the Lord tell you, Ike?
Mama, when kin me and Earl go to school with David Lee?
Because he cared so damn much about you and me, child.
The boy is hungry, Rebecca.
What we make it to? The next season to work ourselves to death, share croppin' for ol' man Howard, so he can get richer and we can't even eat when the croppin' time is done?
I'll wait till after the children.
To invite you to his house -- the two of you could just sit under the shade tree, drink ice cold whiskey, and just shoot the breeze!
I got to see my husband, Sheriff Young!
Will they give him a trial?
My head hurts.
How would you like to go to the principal's office?
But you guys... It's Salisbury steak.
They're burning all the Canadian stuff cause of the war.
We're going... Let's run through the plan!!
Cuz, dummy they're Canadian, just like Ike!
Come on, Cartman. It's not your fault.
I'm trying, I can't find a Canadian server... I've got to break into the main frame...
I had to ride my bike here. My behind is killing me.
No you guys... Something happened... You guys wanna hear something creepy?  I don't think Kenny is dead.
No way.
But mom!  I'm not fucking addicted to fucking bad language!  I don't have a fucking problem!
Yes, hon?
I bet him he couldn't set himself on fire and now he's all pissed off!!  AGH! I can't say pissed off?!  AGH!!
Eric, that is not appropriate.
I don't know.
Something big, children.
What?
This will be very dangerous... Are you quite sure?
Mph rmph rm rmph rm?
Mph rmph rm rmph rm.
Mph rm. Rmph rm rmph rm.
Mrph mprph!!
Uhh... I don't know.
Time? Did time matter to the Revolutionists who were forced to eat their own shit while dying in the dungeons of ze King?
Sheet.  Did you bring ze mirror?
What's a dying giraffe sound like?
Careful? Was my mother careful when she stabbed me in the heart with a clothes hanger while I was still in ze womb?
We can't leave without you!
Where do they come up with this stuff?!
Yeah, let's swear we won't tell!
I don't know, dude.
Totally!
What has the world come to? This is horrible. We're locked up, burning books, hating other people-
I agree! The only way to save our future is to unite and fight!  <b>Something must be done! We must take action fast! My parents have gotten so strict they forgot they were children in the past!</b>
Did you shut the alarm off, Cartman?
He was killed doing something he saw in the movie. It was Terrance and Phillip... THEY killed Kenny.
YES! AND I WILL NOT ALLOW MY CHILDREN TO BE RUINED BY SMUT!!  I am sorry young man, but I have had it up to here! STRAP THEM IN!
Well find out where that signal is coming from!  Then hunt them down like dogs! Any and all Canadian influence must be stopped at all cost!
What is Terrance and Phillip?
Yes Principal Victoria.  The PTA is impeaching you.
This is NOT a place for fun and games! This is rehabilitation! Now GET TO IT!! We at MAC have a trial to go to!
Very encouraging. Most of the children have been weened from their naughty mouths.
Well, some of the children just don't respond to 12 step programs.
I don't care if it's dangerous! Desperate times call for desperate measures, Mr. Mackey. Perhaps I need to remind you of your situation.
A letter from who, you shit sucking cock master?
YOU'D fuck your uncle!
I did, Terrance, I learned that you are a boner biting dick fart fuck face!
I sure did, Phillip!!
I know, Terrance.  This is quite the shitstorm we've found ourselves in this time.
I'm not cranky.  And that futon was not too big to carry myself-
Oh I love when you get all biblical Satan.  You know exactly how to turn my crank!
<b>Hey, guy, relax, put out! You gotta relax, shut your mouth- Baby I'd do anything for ya! Now don't make me smack you in the eye like last time-</b>
No! It can't be!
Who gives a fuck?! I was just fucking with him!
Stan?! YOU started La Resistance?
Cool!
They're not going to make it!
You're Warren Wayne.
It certainly is.
I was there.  Officer Taylor accessed my CPU directly to open the airlock doors.  They are not functioning properly.
The device has stopped responding.
I hear you Mac and I appreciate it. Frankly I don't know what I'd have done without you on this one.
Well, maybe I will.  You sure you don't want anything?
That's very professional sounding of you, Taylor.
Sure you do.  Sending Mac out on a little recon work.  How pathetic.  Problem is it seems Mac blew a few fuses.  Or maybe he's just a little drunk. Were you partying with a robot Taylor?
That's me.
I told you, I had to teach a few people a lesson!
That's clear.
Well, plus the money ain't that bad. DAWN So, tell me, do you think everyone gets their million dollars' worth on this trip of a lifetime?
Like open an airlock by mistake?
Well I hope I don't do anything careless.
Still, I hope I behave on the moon.  I'll stick close to you.
Well maybe there's a way out of here.
It depends on the condition of the ship.  If I could get to one of the suit compartments I could check the exterior air locks for a possible entry.
Great.
Suppose you didn't have to hold your breath?
You're right.
Close every door behind you!
Ready as I'll ever be.
At this point I'm ready for anything.
One of Barnes' duds, luckily for us.  Take this out of the equation right now...
Why?  Where are you going?
Don't worry about me.  There's still a chance I can issue a distress signal.
Taylor!  Where are you?
I'm about to blow the wall.
And so far.
Marry you?
It would matter to us.
Good.  In that case, I pronounce us man and wife.
Is there anything I can help you with?
There's no time to explain.  Get everyone together!  We found a way to the pods!
Are you nuts!  It's too risky!
I guess so.
Talk to him...Jesus...
Who are you calling a pig, rummy?
Because, Taylor wouldn't do that, that's why.
The engines!
Certainly.  If you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available --
Alteration of my central processing unit should be done only by an authorized service dealer.
Nope.
He's my dad.
No, pinhead, he ain't here to bowl.
Wait! That's an aria!
Nothing going on here, everybody stand back. Let him through, ladies. Ladies, please. As they start to move through the female throng, a little girl pops out in front of them, holding her ball.
Sheila, meet...uh...  I forget the name.
I'm sure you have Buzz.
I need a sponsor to get my sanction card back. Where I come from, you're the king.
Thanks.
I got a right. You're my father.
You know what a mixer ball is? It's like you, you come out of nowhere and upset things, scattering everything all over. Buzz grumpily waves at him to sit.
You shouldn't listen to her, she's a nervous old Nellie.
I couldn't pay someone enough to try to kill me. Sheila comes over to take their orders.
The small ball.
Not for me. Miniature golf's for pansies.
What's it look like to you?
He says that to all his wives.
See ya 'round Maynard.
Clam it!
He's not the guy, Millie. Just whip the whips.
You're prone to violent outbursts, aren't you?
Nobody touches her. Except me. I touch her. Sheila told me you played bouncy- bouncy with her.
You made me hurt him!
If Junior thinks you're doing the bouncy- bouncy with his sister, he's gonna tap dance on your spleen.
You know who I am?
That's right, didn't you have a slight control problem in a recent tournament,champ?  Now go take out your "big four", darling.  Come on, we're making her nervous.
Profits down there, philanthropy up here.  Besides, it beats the pants off bingo.
I think Buzz is retiring soon. In fact, I think he's retiring tonight. Kastle pulls out a shiny gold credit card and holds it in front of Sheila.
Ssssh! Now real quiet. On three. One...two...three!
Look who's talking!
You still got the touch Junior.
You keep that up Carmelita and one day you'll be a champion just like Mr. Skinner here. What do you think, Theo? Think Carmelita's got the stuff?
She hit it, Mr. Kastle!
Who wants to know?  Zeus!
I couldn't kill Buzz. I need his help. Theo helps Millie load suitcases into the trunk of her car.
I think that a motorbike is one of the last really free things that people can do.
He follows me, he tries to have sex with me, and then they send him to the nut-hut for a while and then he gets out and then he follows me, he tries to have sex with me, they send him to the nut-hut for a while...
No, not at all.
Nobody in this town really understands Junior. When I went to family sessions for him I realized he was the sanest one in the family. Actually, he's the only one in this whole fucking town who knows exactly who he is and what he wants.
Well, that was plan A.
Nothing.
I could let them go for ten.
If you want a professional man, you have to be willing to pay for him.
Why should I help that old fuck.
Zip.
Tell me, Sheila. What are you afraid of? Sheila shakes her head.
If he's not dead, he'll keep coming back.
I did your dirty work for you Sheila, now fuck off. Theo drives away leaving Sheila standing alone. She watches his car recede with a thoughtful expression, then turns on her heel.
When I'm with you Sheila, I don't even think about bowling. Theo takes Sheila in his arms and kisses her passionately. She stops him and looks around nervously.
Plan C. From now on it's gonna be plan C. Both bodies throb and grind, their sandy hands sliding over each others' sweaty skin.
I didn't come this far to bury a guy that's not my dad. He owes me.
Suck my dick!
I am a professional man.
You bet. For five bucks, I'll even throw in the tongue.
I'm looking for somebody.
We provide some extracurricular activities for the senior citizens in the community.
Tell your little pal to let go.
Ow! Ooh! No, please! Doc said I'd be back on the planks in a week! Show him Breeze! Breeze pulls a copy of "New York Bowler" from his pocket. The headline reads "RUB OUT!:BOWLING LEGEND KACKED BY DWARFSCAM KINGPIN" with a photo of Buzz Fazeli.
Please, Dr. Levine.
Open it, Captain!
They're like pink snow, sir.  Sticky.
I can't see...
Back away then.
How about I just press the button?
How long will that be?
Two and a half days?
Shut up, Beth.  I don't want to hear it.
Forty yards.
He's right beneath us.
Do it, Norman, it's the only choice we have.  This thing is gonna crush us.
From what?  What's with all the security?
Hold on --
But sir, I don't understand.  This report -- these recommendations... they're for an encounter with extra- terrestrial life.
What's wrong with oxygen?
Or maybe, it can't <u>be</u> killed.
I'm telling you, Harry's lost it. He's saying there's a deathwish out for each of us.
How drastic?
You knowingly recommended a woman with suicidal tendencies for a government operation --
-- and then brought her down here --
Maybe so.  But I think we need to ask Jerry about it.
Jerry?
Well, where the fuck is he?
In a minute, sir.
To the craft?  None.  Not a scratch.
Chipped?  The door?  How can it be chipped?
Yes, Harry.
So do we.  And it seems to have picked up something on it's travels.
What?
Ted seems to have some ideas.
Ladies and Gentlemen...
Please watch your closest monitor...
We're all very proud of you, Harry, but what the hell is it?
What's the message?
She's not gonna know, sir.
What -- you want me to retype it?
The wing dimension alone is larger that any aircraft we've seen.
What are you going to do -- shoot her?
What do you make of this?
The sensors are picking up something outside.
Too big?
I've read it twice, Norman.  It's brilliant.
We can't go down there.  We're not prepared.  That deep?  That takes years of training, Beth.  We're just scientists.  Lab scietists.  We wear ties and lab coats to work -- not oxygen tanks.
What -- are you threatening me?
The library.
A bad one.  It was the only book in there.  Norman, come here, look at this.
What?
They are or they aren't.  Which is it?
Beth.
What are they?
So what?
You're jumping to conclusions, Beth. Don't get worked up --
Beth --
I have to reset the sub.
Don't bother me, Norman.
You don't trust me?
You press a button, Norman.  It's not brain surgery.  Here, go ahead.  You only have 15 minutes to reset it.  Go on, Norman...
I can't see anything.  How does it look?  Still clear?
You fixed this suit?  Beth?
Still clear.
Yeah, well, I get that way when I'm facing death and someone deserts me.
Did you look?  It was on the top shelf.
I don't know, Beth.  I wasn't there.
What?
But why is he doing it?
Tarazine?
Antihistamine.  For bites.
Antibiotic.
"... used as an anesthetic if given in combination with paracin trichloride... "
How fast does it take effect?
You're not sorry.  You're scared.  You're a psychologist, Norman.  You pride yourself on knowing when someone's lying to you, not telling you the truth.  And now you're scared ... because you're not sure you can tell anymore.
What do you mean, different?
Your watch.
Snakes?  What do you mean, exactly?
You tell me.
No, he can't.
Am I?  Or am I making so much sense that you're going insane?
Is it?
It's either this... or I kill you.
It's not safe for you to be either.
Don't fuck with me, Beth.
You're frightened, aren't you, Norman?
Don't you know?
I know.  You're too strong, Beth.
C'mon --
Let's get out of here, Beth.  Let's go home.
Beth --
Well, think.  Because there's footprints here that aren't mine.
By the bunks.
For whoever's in that thing.
Yeah, I don't know how you could make that confusion.
In time for what?
Just in time for what?
Like what?  I'm not --
No, why don't --
Whatever I can do to help.
On that flight recorder, they called the black hole an "Unknown Entry Event." They didn't know what a black hole was.  Fifty years from now, men are going to build that ship in a very tentative, experimental way, with no knowledge that time travel through a black hole is possible.
Gimme another explanation.
What are you still doing here?
You don't understand about the sphere.
What are they?
Stop what?  What are you -- ?
I'm trying.  Shit.  Here -- catch her.
Wait!
You mean forget?
What is it, Harry?
Arrived?  From where?
Thank you.
They're in the sub, sir.  Waiting.
What was that, sir?
Captain who?
Earth doesn't have a patent on buttons, Ted.
Please, Ted.
This is like nursery school.
Of course he did.  He's been isloated for 400 years.  He wants someone to talk to.  Look, you put a human being in isolation for four days, they can become neurotic, sometimes psychotic.  We're talking about 400 years here.  An alien that shows emotional responses.  I think we need to address him, before he reacts further.
Don't be so supportive, honey.
Well, I've brought you here.  What now?
Their bases are very well hidden. All the power of the Empire can't find them... Do you know where they are?
I'm beginning not to like you.
Fear is their greatest weapon.
Check your data banks for all the information you have on Imperial procedures.  Both of you will have to learn...
... and I want you to start cleaning the equipment out of the scan- shielded compartments.
But you are... I know your 'Diary of the Clone Wars' by heart.  My father...
I know that.
You could put it that way.
My father used to talk about the Force of Others.  But he never told me what it was...
You mean I generate an energy field?
Could I learn to feel it?
Five, maybe.  Let me handle it.
I rarely use it any more.  I have the Force.  The Force is more powerful than any pistol.  You shouldn't put too much faith in that weapon.  Work on becoming aware of the Force... learn to feel its presence within you.  Try to sense what it's telling you.  It's the only thing you can rely on.
You mean we should go after her!...
But there was a lot of firing earlier...
Send one squad up.
Then I think we're due the reward you offered... and it had better be substantial after what we've been through.
What's that little 'droid' carrying that's so blasted important?
The fourth moon of Yavin.  I've given the coordinates to Chewbacca.
I'd like to get paid before that eventually.  I don't plan to stick around for the fireworks.
It's automatic.
Why didn't you say so before.
They must be shielded somehow.  I'm sure the base is there.
I know, but the chances for survival here just aren't great enough in my book.  I've got what I came for. Now I've got to get back to my ship.
I will, but I'll have enough time to transmit my application first.
Indeed, sir, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good shape as we are, what with the rebellion and all...
No, you're not.  What kind of talk is that...
For the moment.  We're in the main hangar.  Artoo is trying to plug into the system now.
Something... I've got...you don't.
Oh, yeah ? I don't see anyone else here with the chops to lead.
Bye ! Write me ! I'm gonna kill you guys !
It's what I deserve.
What about it, Diz ?
Sorry, son. I can't do it. You signed the 1240/A. It would be illegal.
If you can't do those numbers, you haven't got a chance.
Love... how excruciatingly pathetic. Now try and pay attention.
Didn't they tell you, Colonel ? That's what cap troopres are good for.
Twenty-five by five, roll seven. And don't exceed port speed.
Don't mess with the boss. So what'd the captain say ?
Me, too... Day and Night-Cycle.
THERE !	GRAVITY FIELD... IT'S BIG !
You're upset, that's alright.
Aw, c'mon, it's just a bug.
Excuse me...!
I don't want everyone to see.
How come that's all you talk about anymore ?
Carl can wait.
You two have so much in common.
I don't even know if you're my girl.
Did you get Starside R&D ?
He left this morning. He couldn't say where.
I'll miss you, too, Johnny.
Should I be ?
I like it. It's kinda...you.
He requested a combat assignment. There's always a need for experienced pilots on the ground. I had no choice but to let him go... He said you'd understand.
That's it, we're empty ma'am !
Sure.
You got it.
You take the stroll down Washout Lane, you're only proving one thing, Johnny.
All bands.
Who gave you this idea ? It's that teacher. What's his name ? You know the one I mean.
Looks like rain.
I'm not going on vacation ! I want to be acitizen ! It's my decision. I made it.
Keep trying, Sergeant.
Are you kidding ? They always get killed. You want the job ?
Good luck. It's not there anymore.
Must fill your bottle up real quick when your wife and kids get smeared.
Sir, thank you, sir !
I want to be a citizen because... well, because of my girl, sir.
This would be mine, sir. Acting Sergeant John Rico. I've assumed command on this mission.
The Rodger Young just burned up...
Nah, I figureyou folks oughta get upstairs before it's too late... Gimmee the nuke.
Good for you. Go find out.
Uni High Tigers, sir. Don't you remember ? I was captain of the team.
Kill the bitch.
What's going on, Diz ?
Cover us, Ace !
The Creator has not answered.
You infest and control Enterprise. V'ger believes carbon-units interfere with the Creator in the same manner.
Not until V'ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet.
V'ger is announcing that it has arrived, sir -- that it's ready to deliver the information it was programmed to collect...
May I ask Why?
Thank you, sir. I'm sorry I embar- rassed you.
I'm aware of that, sir.
Sir, you haven't logged a single star hour in two and a half years. That, plus your unfamiliarity with the ship's design -- in my opinion, sir, seriously jeopardizes our mission.
No...  ... that could also be misinter- preted as hostile, Mr. Decker.  Cloud composition, Mr. Spock?
I would never take advantage of a sexually immature species.  You can assure him that's true, can't you?
If I'd seen you again, would you have been able to say it?
Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.
I stand corrected Mr. Decker.  Navigator, lay in a conic section flight path into the cloud center; bring us parallel to whatever we find in there...
Ten seconds....
We're already two settings below that, sir.
That was the order, Mr. Sulu: Clear the bridge.
Communicated with us <U>how</U>?
Our... 'insignificance'?
Instruments fluctuating, Captain. Patterns unrecognizable.
Transmit image of the Alien to Starfleet; advise we are attempting further communication.
... they may have followed it <U>too</U> precisely.
I am uneasy with that being our only hope of more information.
I am seeking answers, Captain.
'Is this all I am? Is there not more?'
Yes, Captain, a child: evolving into adulthood -- learning, searching -- instinctively needing.
Yes, Captain. It needed our mortality, the fear of it, our struggle against it, our fears, our dreams...
Engineer, we need Warp speed now!
Aye, we understand that sir! We're doing our best.
Helm ready, sir.
Evening, Cal.  Would you tell me about it?
N'about ten minutes.  What was your movie about?
It's about a man who gets a second chance.
No, no, I see...
Yes...
As the Old Mill goes around...
No, no.  Of course, that's <u>exactly</u> what it represents...
Everyday things...yes.
Mmm.
What are you doing?  I love your script.
You bet your life.  "The mill wheel goes around...some times it's even under water -- then it rises up, as high as it can go..."
Well, first, you got to change the title...
<u>Yes</u>...
My glasses fell apart.  I lost the...
One moment.
You going to ask me in?
Oh.  That's alright.  Then I'll come back at a better time.  What would be a better time?
Because I'd met someone else.
They meet on Main Street.  Her horse has just died.  He's coming from the fire.
Has been wounded by <u>her</u> heat...by her <u>infidelities</u>...
Going home.
People might be better off.  They thought about it, spent the evening back in the...
Sleep well?
But that's what happened.
...you think that's right...
I'm going to tell the truth.
After Drama Group.
Tuesdays and Thursdays.  But after Play Practice, I'm yours.
What is it, a surprise?
Yes, that's right.
Where have you been...
Why, you <u>whore</u>!
We'll work it out...
That a fact.  Now, is it a good play?
Well, they don't always leave with the ones they came in with.
Hi.
Town in New Hampshire was small town America too.  Forty thousand dollars a day, to shoot on the street.  And <u>then</u> they kicked us out...
I'm bleeding, Bill, I'm <u>bleeding</u>...
What, what, what, what do they got that can pass for the Old Mill...
On the coast?  Of <u>course</u> he's on the coast, where's he gonna be, the <u>Hague</u>...
I <u>know</u> my lines...
But, that's the way of the world, huh? Everybody's gotta eat.  Way of the world.
I don't eat vegetables.
I...
Page...<u>three</u>.  Now:  "It's a nice evening."  I'm not gonna say that... "It's a nice..."
He's saying, what are you saying, Bobby?
What...
You can go...
Well, yeah, I'm fine, I reached over to, the girl had to be home, I don't know, it's a <u>schoolnight</u>, something...
No, wait a, wait a, wait a...we can't put her in the car, she gets it in her head to sue, or rape, or some goddam, she wasn't in...
Mr. Barrenger.
You have to what?
Then what is the...?
She's absolutely r...
I feel so <u>close</u> to you...
I just...
Yes, yes, but...
It isn't <u>right</u>.  I can't...I...I know I si...I, they, I don't know if they told me it was in the con...
Everybody, they, they, they treat me like a...
Because he understood.  That was her life's blood on the stage.
I'm only trying to...
...she has a <u>home</u>...
He's staying here?  Bob Barrenger is staying he...?
I can't tell.
She won't stop crying...
Mornin, Chessy...how's the back...?
...a history of <u>nothing</u>, he was acquitted...
Yes.
A witness to what...?
Sure.
We're very upset with her.  Get someone to <u>double for her</u>, her tits, the tits scene, call L.A.  I want to see some <u>pictures</u> of the women's <u>tits</u>.  Of their <u>tits</u>.
You're very sorry, you passive aggressive, son-of-a-bitch...can we replace him?
My wife is going to have a baby, and...
You what...?  Is that on the callsheet, is that on the callsheet, or is that <u>personal business</u>?  Ah, Christ. <u>Marty</u>...Are we <u>paying</u> you?
You know, they told me there were gonna be some jokes.  Kid the New Guy...
You built an Old Mill in New Hampshire...
...she keeps her back to the camera...?
I'm out.
For what cause?
I really don't think you should be talking this way to a lady.
No.
I don't know.
I...?  I saw it.  I was there.
55 days and I take home the camera. I got an idea for a <u>product</u> placement...
That's what I said.
Later for that, Walt, let's get this:  we need the "pages" for the new "Old Mill"...alright?  We need a new title, we need a...
Actually, the art department had some ideas on...
Gimme Howie Gold.  Howie?  Thizz...I neee...I NEED EIGHT HUNDRED GRAND.  I...I don't care where it comes from...  It comes out of our end.  I...I need...JUST GET ME THE MONEY. I...JUST GET ME THE GODDAMN MONEY...Look:
He's got a gift for fiction.
That we could use you in and I think that's quite a fine trade-off all around and an ill wind that blows somebody good.
I don't want to invite someone else, because this is the <u>most</u> <u>exclusive</u>...
Dear, this is Mr. Rossen, he is the producer...
Sherry, Sherry...
And we're glad to have you here...
Bet you did.
Givvem a cigarette...
I have to work on my video project! Don't follow me!  I can put myself to bed.
I killed her!
It happens.
That will never happen.
I'll ride ahead.  Nelson, protect the Queen...
Why does Rachel scream?
I live.  In the same country.
Or blush.  You look pale.
Are you <u>kidding</u>?  It is <u>so</u> much better than the one Rachel showed me!
Like a big sister.
A debate.  Man's inhumanity to woman.  He's pro women.  I'm con. Ms. Flannery is twisted.
Great.
This is a joke, right?
Maybe twenty.
You cannot <u>believe</u> what he said, it was the worst <u>instant</u> of my total life on <u>Earth</u>!!
Until he's old enough to read.
I'm almost done making it.  Alright Ben -- <u>you</u> deal with the tardy, <u>you</u> write yourself a note, your daddy <u>told</u> you he had an important case this morning and he had to leave early and we were AAAAGGGGHHHH!
Don't touch me!  I'm <u>allergic</u> to you!
But we're hungry -- and I have to pick up my costume for the pageant!  It starts at seven!
He's not kidnapped he's -- he's just hiding -- he's just -- BENNNN?  GODDAMMIT!
Now could she just...<u>forget</u> me!
Why don't you say hello?
That's because your mother is a fine person, finer than I will ever be.  Now, just this once...
Uh.  He thinks his nose is too big.  But it's not.
No.  But they stand out, a little. Like this.
Oh.  It's an incredibly disgusting, and not remotely sexy thing, that they described in a movie I'd never let you go to.  But it's real.  Does he have an older brother?
But Rache...
Ice cold water.
YOU'RE WORSE THAN <u>SHE</u> IS!  WHY DON'T YOU JUST DIE, <u>TOO</u>?
There's worse things.
Then have a donut --
Annabelle let's get something clear.
No!  You're cheating -- you have to start from the beginning and you have to read the whole thing I can't sleep otherwise.
Well, that's a long way off, sweetie. We'll talk to Mom and Dad...
Seven of clubs.  Nobody's mad we just want to talk about it.
Is that like Luigi's?
Is your bad?
Rache can do that part.
But you can still see him.
No, it isn't.  Because it isn't everything.  And we want every- thing, don't we?
Sooner than later.  You really need to.
Look, I will <u>send</u> a P.A. to pick up the children.  There are <u>agencies</u> that supply sitters, nannies...
No, no, no, this is a job that's hard to <u>keep</u>, <u>not</u> a job that's hard to <u>lose</u>, can't be both.
Luke, I need to switch next Friday for Thursday, so why don't you take the weekend...  ...that way you'll be there, and I'll pick up Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
You're WHERE?
Jackie, <u>we</u> were taking them water- skiing for the <u>whole</u> weekend!
Not to me.
Annabelle showed me the new dress. She's amazing in it.
Tell me exactly how you're different from three years ago?  The music sounds kind of the same from where I'm sitting.
To make it easier for them or you?
WE are over.
Maybe you could back off just a little bit --
...a ridiculously <u>expensive</u> and <u>inappropriate</u> item, which her father and I have already <u>told</u> her she is <u>far</u> too young to own.  But <u>you</u> apparently want to <u>buy</u> her forgiveness, with...
No.  I thought it might be uncomfortable for her --
You're damn right.  I'm gonna sick of your imperious bullshit.  I never said I was Betty Fucking Crocker.  If every time life hits her in the face you want to have a 12 hour talk every third Friday or the month -- go ahead!  I have a life!
I didn't need you to take the blame for me, I'm quite...
I'm already on thin ice.  Yesterday, I actually thought my boss was going to fire me.
Why not just bring the whole toilet?
...it's my problem, too.
Really.  By what right?  Six months of part-time screw-ups?
See, I know that.
Ironic, huh?
Beats me.  Ask your mom.
Juggle it!  Move the darkroom into your house.  You've got that room downstairs with the treadmill Luke never uses anyway.  Don't lose your confidence.  Don't lose your edge.
Don't be too sure.
So you became the hero.  And I became the schmuck.
That's not wh...
Neutral ground.  What's up?
Don't flatter yourself.  I always liked that line.
Come on, a wuss like me?  The stiff who wouldn't help her own daughter fight back?
What do I have that you don't?
I have their past.
It was a veal stock, I thi...
Jesus.
But you're not good at this.  Not yet. I'm sorry.
I made that paella you liked. It's on the stove.
Thanks, Scoob.
He was in a concentration camp?
Great to be here.
Well, I was thinking...I might work for you.
Yes.
This is work.
Mi Jesusmi jesus
Jesus was not bad.
He wasn't.
For rape and murder.
You think so? You don't think that this might not be a little dry?
OK, then we can invite serious intellectual types.
Hip alternative types who will understand the process better
Don't worry, he doesn't mean money.
How was the class?
I was never much of a sweater. You know that.
You're absolutely right. The focus is on the college admissions process today.
Yeah...How do we know we won't be exploited?
The same.
Sure, Dad.
What are you doing here?
Say, 'Nigger, fuck me hard!'
Again!
Hello, is this Pam?
That's what I was gonna ask you.
Oh, yeah, well...um...I was just calling because, well, I was wondering if you still remembered me, which I guess you do...
Well, um, I kind of let things go on this novel I'd been really into - I mean, the whole publishing industry is totally corrupt. I mean, really, it's finished.
N-not yet. I'm hoping to get a grant for this one project on teenagers. Geez, remember when we were teenagers?
Oh, I don't remember that...
Yeah.
Yeah, sure.
Yeah?
Yeah, well, it's possible they would be interested in it.
I dunno. I'd like to be good at something. It doesn't have to be TV. I mean, it could be movies...Anything. I'd be willing to direct.
Don't be. Your movie's a hit.
Well, I-I hope that--that--
Well get someone down there!
I don't know--look!  They can get in now, man!  We got no one left to guard it!
Why? Are we going dancing?
What are you going to do, Cooper, throw yourself on a Bunsen burner? It's a bunch of businessmen touring a lab.  We'll be out in no time.
Just the soda, please. Cooper heads down the hall.  Filmore watches him leave, sighs, then turns and smiles at the General manager:
Who's got matches?
What happened!
No but you didn't defend him either! Didn't want to rock the boat.  Guess the ride was too smooth. FILMORE I was acting under legal counsel!
We're on sublevel six.  We'll pass some labs and then we'll hit the stairwell--
Where does it lead?
Hey now!  No cussing on TV!  Well in closing I'd like to say that there are two reasons to have that money outside in an hour.  One is my perky co-anchor here, and the second is the lives of tens of thousands of people--people just like you and me!
Shut up!
He's in there...
I'll let the senator tell you.
I haven't been briefed on any such thing!
Richter-we got a problem!
What are you so worked up about jack? Fuck 'em--we don't need 'em.
Gotcha.  We've been filling barrels all day--we've got  hell of a stockpile.
If I don't get power up we are!
How much of this shit do they have, White!!
You will not get away with this vicious attack on our peace-loving people.
All right, Mister Ambassador!  But you must treat General "Buck" Schmuck with the respect due him.
Now, Mister Ambassador.  In a very few moments we should have Premier Belch on the phone.  I intend to tell him exactly what has happened.  I merely want you to authenticate certain facts for him.
Did you get that, Kulnick?
I am sorry.  Sub-miniature photography is my hobby.  It's amazing what excellent en- largements you can make from the negative.
Our scientists calculated that the detonation of fifty of our biggest nuclear devices, jacketed in Cobalt-Thorium-G would enshroud the earth in a hundred years of lethal radio- activity from which no human life could escape. In ten months the Earth would be as dead as the Moon.
The report is entirely untrue.  I can assure you of that.
Bah!  All you wanted to do was spy in our country!
Oh, yes, that's right.
Ah, but if we were able to untrigger it, that would be defeating its purpose.  All our enemies would have to do, would be to warn us in advance that they were going to violate one of our unalterable triggering conditions. We would bluff, naturally, but in the end we would be insane not to untrigger it. Now we can say: There is no point trying to intimidate us, we don't control the Doomsday Machine.
That's right, fella.
It might still be worth trying Riki-Tiki- Tavi.  R...T...T...There's only three combinations of -- T...T...R, or T...R...T...
Look, I didn't shoot him!
Look, General Ripper went off his rocker and ordered the 843rd Bomb Wing to attack with H-bombs.
Wait a minute.  The President!!  That's it! The President!!!
He wanted to talk to General Ripper, didn't he?
That's government property, Major.
What is your name, young lady?
General Schmuck, we monitored a trans- mission about six minutes ago from Burpelson Air Force Base, HQ 843rd Wing.  It was apparently directed to their Wing on air- borne alert.  It decoded as - Wing attack, Plan-R.
That's a very wise deduction, General.
Well...I suppose penetrate the base by force.
This is General Ripper speaking.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.  What's up, General Ripper?
Yes, sir.
Please don't take any notice of this weapon, Major.  I love all weapons, and as of late, I've just taken to keeping a loaded weapon nearby at all times.
And a condition red means enemy attack in progress, doesn't it?
You're damned right they are.
That's close enough, Major.
Where?  Everywhere, Major.  Everywhere.
Mister President, I know you think I've let you down, but we had to have a Plan-R.  If we completely centralized the command and control, all a potential aggressor would have to worry about was knock- ing out maybe half a dozen headquarters and the Capitol, and we'd be out of business. We'd have planes and missiles just sitting there while we were getting clobbered.
Knock it off will you, General?  Crudley, find out what's holding up that call!
Naturally I am, sir.
Well, sir, it looks like one aircraft, the "Leper Colony", failed to receive the recall.
Well, the Premier doped it out pretty well. Its primary is their missile base at Laputa.
If I can speak freely, sir -- look, these guys talk big, but frankly, we think they're short of know-how.  You can't just take a bunch of ignorant peasants and expect them to understand a machine like one of our boys, and I don't mean that as an insult, Mister Ambassador.  Hell, we all know what kind of guts your people have.  Why just look how many millions of 'em those Nazis  killed and, hell, they still wouldn't quit.
Well, sir, if the A/C's a really good man, I mean really sharp, why he can barrel that plane along so low - well you just have to see it some time.  A real big plane, like a Sting Ray, zig-zagging in, its jet exhaust frying chickens in the barnyard ---  Has he a chance?.....Hell, yes!  He has one hell of a chance.
Main interference linked to electronic detector.  Fight interference on readi- ness state.
They're moving apart.
Hey, Terry, I'm hit.
Sure, I'll take her up to eight hundred.
Primary arming switch.
Damn you, Lieutenant Toejam!  Lothar!
Let's see...International Morse, I think ...K...E...O...P...E...R...E...C...A...L... L...M...I...S...T...A...K...E...O...P...E... Gee, I don't know, it seems to be some kind of code.
First safety.
Master Kong.
Quentin, how's your gear?
What do you mean?
Well, we sure as hell aren't going home just because the enemy tells us to.
You tell me.
But the CRM-114 has been smashed for almost an hour.
Like hell it does.
Look, King, maybe you've lost too much blood, or something.
But the code is made up by General Ripper, and he's the only one left at the base who would know the code.
It's me - Lothar.  Are you okay?
But I TOLD YOU, I don't think we can get the bomb bay doors open.
Let me check.
I just wanted you to know I didn't mean anything by it.
But who would be chosen?
"Burger Manifesto, Part One" is gonna make people think?
Rehab. Outpatient. I have to go once a week. It's kind of like AA.
Was it okay?
What did you guys think?
No, thanks. I don't drink. Um, well, what'd she say? I mean, did she talk to him?
Yeah, when's he coming?
Oh. Well, what's it on?
Buff, that slice is the difference between life and death for some half-dead Bangladeshi.
He's around and, you know, maybe he's coming by. Sooze told him to come by and hang out, whatever. It's no big deal. Me, him, and Sooze are gonna...
Yes!
I wouldn't. If I were in his shoes, every morning I'd get up singing, man. Do my work-out, take a shower, followed by a hearty breakfast, steak and eggs, washed down with a pot of hot coffee, six pack of Coors Lite. Then I'd order my bodyguard to go find my babe, who would appear decked out in her all-black leather Victoria Secret custom-made bodysuit. So I'd, like, have to chew off all her clothes until she was completely nude. Except she'd have these amazing dragon tattoos all over her body and pierced nipples with little gold peace signs hanging from 'em. And then she'd take out this half-ounce of blow, we'd snap out a few mondo lines, vaporize a few million brain cells, screw for about an hour, then spend the rest of the morning trashed watching Gilligan.
Same, more of the same. Yep, just keep doing the same thing all the time, around and around the clock. With an occasional burger or slice of thrown in for our vitamins and energy. Then, instead of watching Gilligan, we'd watch Captain Kirk.
So, we're all old friends of Pony's. We go way back to our childhood.
So you can do an album cover?
No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm not worried.
No, I'm not worried.
No, I mean, no one.
Okay, Buff, listen to me for a second alright?
Buff, can you listen to me for a second?
Wait a minute, wait a minute. You saw Erica last night?
Let's go look, then. Let's go look, then!
No.
I'm just gonna go. I figure the worst I can do is starve to death.
Yeah, right, publicist.
Oh, Pony's band "Dream Girls"? Been on the road opening for "Midnight Hore". Stadiums, man.  Wait, so Pony's coming by here?
Yeah.
Playing with something really hot. Yeah.
Yup. Hey, um, so, um, listen, man, I got to go show the tape to Danny at the hotel, and if I get the gig, Erica is gonna teach me how to surf in L.A.
Um, if you're talking to me, could you make some sense? 'Cause I don't speak Swahili.
Ah, that's nice. They have many convenience stores there for you to stand in front of.
Naw, naw, we don't have time for all that.
Don't drop the guitar, man.
Hey, thanks, man.
No man.  He's probably the most famous guy that'd ever come in this place. You're lucky he's here.
"Closed, closed, closed." But with your music.
Alright, get in the car before I have to embarrass you in front of your friend.
Okay.
Maybe upper-middle-class.
He is.
Erica. So do you think you and I are alike, Erica?
Oh, uh, Erica? Erica is the publicist for the band.
Yeah, she, uh, works for the record company and takes care of interviews and, you know, shit like that, Uh, we were actually just doin' an interview and Erica said she's like to see Burnfield, so...
Thank you.
Mm-mm.
He causes problems. He was here earlier.
Right on. You know what? He doesn't need the limo, man.
Well, I, you know, I took her to the van, you know. It was goin' all hot and heavy and she started hanging on me, you know? And she started crying, "Tim, Tim, what's the matter? I love you. Don't go!" And I was just looking at her stupid face and her stupid eyes, stupid mouth and I was filled with disgust, man. And I fuckin'... Oh, man, I really...
I hit her.
Yeah, of course they let me out. Chickenshits. I gotta pay some class C misdemeanor ticket. So did I call it or did I call it? She spent the night, didn't she? Hm? Oh, that sucks for you, pal. Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
Oh, Jeff, give me a break. You didn't even have the guts to go look in the van, did you?
Good, good. I, I hope he does.
They're just people. Alright? They got feelings, you know?
He's got a gun. He's got a gun.
Hey, Ma, look at me! Top of the world, Ma!
Yeah, well, thank you for the advice, but you wouldn't understand what is going on with me.
Okay. Nazeer, okay?
Nazeer Chaudry!
I don't know. I think she's breathing.
It's a piece.
One!
What? What do you stand for?
It was just something that got out of hand. Did anyone get hurt?
Did it ever occur to you that I might have some feelings about you moving to New York?
Mm.
Yes, you do.
Jeff!
No, I mean it. No, look, when, when I got out of the car I walked all the way here.
I, yeah.
Yes, Jeff, away. Away, away, away.
What?
Just go.
Hey, the driver knows Billy Idol. Wow, huh?
We sold, uh, over ninety thousand units and uh... and Danny says that we're gonna get a gold record. Yeah.
What?
Yeah.
What?
Oh, no, man, look. Look, you know, it's me, okay? I come out here and I'm, so used to everyone, you know, kissing my ass and I think I'm a fucking star, man, and I'm really sorry if I'm full of attitude. I, I really...
Yeah, yeah. That's the fucking problem.
Hey, you know what? Go fuck yourself.
Oh, shit. Jeff. Jeff, come up here!
What are you saying?
This has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah.
Oh, it's stupid, isn't it.
Oh, yeah, just sitting there eatin' a salad, you know. That kind of thing happens all the time in L.A. It's, you know... I met Johnny Depp.
Yeah, we'd have to fly you out for meetings, you know.
Yeah.
Oh, no, man. I can't.
That was so great!
I can't believe you're still here.
Yep.
Uh, I didn't write any songs. You guys go ahead. I gotta stay here and guard the parking lot.
Erica? She said she was tired. She went back to the hotel.
Don't do that, man, okay?
If you hit me...
Missed it. Can I get a fifth of Old Crow?
Yeah.
It's not the air force anymore, Scuff
You have the largest penis. Can we go please?
Come on, Jeff.
Uh, excuse me, I'd like to know where he gets his ideas.
Shut up, Cleo.  Di, how much do you need for an abortion?
You just became a statistic!
Cleo!
Wayne Gretzky.
It's off... I can't take the fighting, the back-stabbing, the open hostility. We're not acting like cheerleaders, we're acting like a bunch of sorority girls!
Hee-hee-haaaa-weee worked it out.  Heee hee-haaa....
My fault - What do we do that enables us to be as great as we are?
No...I've been pregnant.
You sure?
Look, I might be moody.  I might be gassy.  But I am perfectly sane.  Think about it.  In school, they tell us, "Dreams can come true."  Right?
Of course - of course!  Hands in...
Yeah.
Y'think?
Diane, I've loved you ever since I first saw you -- right before you kicked me in the head.
Jack...
Mmm-hmmm...
That was gas, Sweetie.
I'll just ask the question myself... "Is Jack Bartlett interested in me?"
We're here for you, Diane.
Hee-hee-h-wait a minute.  Hold on, now. What do we do before a big game?
Just call me later.  I gotta get some smokes for Grandma.
Oh thank Buddha it's you, Kim-Lo, I'm being held against my will, my civil rights have been violated and it took four days to make this one phone call...
Ooops, that's me -- gotta run!
Oh yeah, you caught us...
Uh...Yeah, Grandma.  She doesn't mean that.  Kinda lost the old filter with her last stroke.
Yeah.  "Itchy" sent us.
All of you!
Before you?  Whoo-hoo!
You'll pardon me, Norma? Why don't you just sit and watch?  O.K.  Here we go.
Action! The scene starts.
Let it ride for a while.
Don't worry.  She's just a fan for my literary output.
Nothing for Ladd?
I'm sure you'll be glad to meet Mr. Gillis.  He wrote it.
Schaefer.  Betty Schaefer.  And right now I wish I could crawl into a hole and pull it in after me.
We could make some paper boats and have a regatta.  Or should we just turn on the shower?
What teacher?
I tell you this is half sold.
I'll make it short.
I'm not good enough to write it alone.  We'll have to do it together.
Nobody can be that busy.
What's good about it?  I miss him something fierce.
That's the trouble with you readers.  You know all the plots. Now suppose you proof-read page ten while the water boils.
Three cheers for Betty Schaefer! I will now kiss that nose of yours.
Something came up.  I don't want to talk about it.
I don't want it now.
Whose?
That was Norma Desmond on the phone?
Why did she call me?
I didn't come here to see a house. What about Norma Desmond?
No.
If you love me, Joe.
Hello, Mr. deMille.
Lots of people were.  Lindbergh had just landed in Paris.  Come on in.
Nothing.  I just didn't realize what it would be like to come back to the old studio.  I had no idea how I'd missed it.
But remember, darling -- I don't work before ten in the morning, and never after 4:30 in the afternoon.
That's where the popcorn business comes in.  You buy yourself a bag and plug up your ears.
Sure have.  The last one I wrote was about cattle rustlers. Before they were through with it, the whole thing played on a torpedo boat.
Uh-huh.
December twenty-first.
Are you married, Mr.  -- ?
Where do you live?
Thanks for the invitation, but I have my own apartment.
I'll take care of that.
Unpack nothing.  I didn't say I was staying.
Okay.
Not now, my dear.  I'm playing three no trump.
Please.  Now I've forgotten how many spades are out.
Can't you wait till I'm dummy?
Come midnight, how about blind- folding the orchestra and smash- ing champagne glasses on Max's head?
A little.
What's that?
I own three blocks downtown. I have oil in Bakersfield -- pumping, pumping, pumping. What's it for but to buy us anything we want.
What right do you have to take me for granted?
Why not? What I'm trying to say is that I'm all wrong for you. You want a Valentino -- somebody with polo ponies -- a big shot --
Not until you promise to act like a sensible human being.
I'm not just selling the script. I'm selling me.  DeMille always said I was his greatest star.
You're a darling.
I ran into some people I knew.
Nothing is the matter.  I'm having a great time.  Show me some more.
It couldn't have gone better. It's practically set.  Of course, he has to finish this picture first, but mine will be his next.
He'a a shrewd old fox.  He can smell box office.  Only I'm going to outfox him a litt1e.  This isn't going to be C. B. deMille's Salome. It's going to be Norma Desmond's Salome, a Norma Desmond Production, starring Norma Desmond...Home, Max.
Yes, I am, Norma.
Oh.  sure -- if it would make a good scene.
No, they don't.
Norma, grow up.  You're a woman of fifty.  There's nothing tragic about being fifty - not unless you try to be twenty-five.
Goodbye.  Norma.
I sure turned into an interesting driveway.
We have to be very careful.  No sleeping pills, no razor blades. We shut off the gas in her bed- room.
I'd better press your evening clothes, sir.  You have not for- gotten Madame's New Year's party.
I don't know, sir.  Madame made the arrangements.
I'm not inquiring where Mr. Gillis goes every night...
More or less.  Only for the end I've got a gimmick that's real good.
Frankly, no.
You trying to be funny?  -- because I'm all out of laughs.  I'm over a barrel and I need a job.
Greatest thing that could happen to you.  Now you'll have to sit behind that typewriter.  Now you'll have to write.
Did you hate him?  Had you ever thought of doing something like this before?
Yes.  Madame.
The cameras have arrived, Madame.
But where?
The danger. The one Nigel spoke of. It must be near .
It's what we were warned about.
You can do it. You're the most powerful woman on Earth.
There's no need. I learned the Craft from my 						grandmother.
It's for your own protection.
Later.
Relax. Tomorrow this will all seem like a bad dream. Goodbye.
Who didn't?
We have to have a long talk about all this.
No. Argo City. It was on a chunk of rock that was part of Krypton once---but we moved it to inner space.
Ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you.
Just give me a chance to show how much I love you. Love changes everything. Love makes everything possib1e.
Well...I guess one is all right.
But why?
But I don't understand.
And now...the guitars are out of tune, and the words don't make sense, and somebody unplugged the mike...
Feelings are real. Once you've had them, they're yours forever.
Aren't you forgetting about Selena?
Yes.
She has hostages.
I could force you.
You vicious--
He's off doing a top secret uh, investigation.
Oh, no thanks.
Why haven't you been able to contact him? He should have returned from the neutron galaxy ages ago. He may be dead. ZOR-EL But what can you, a mere girl-
It's something they have on Earth. You know, where your cousin went.
No sweat. When's the rest of your stuff arriving?
Mr. Danvers called. I'll get a new one with the insurance money. B.F.D.
I'm Linda Lee.
You're not going anywhere. Except back to nowheresville. You're too impatient, Selena. Look around you--all these people have served years and years of apprenticeship. Some of their families have been in the Craft for generations. You can't join and take over our whole organization in a few months.
You need me, Selena. I'm the only one who can save you from a terrible fate.
You used to listen to me. When you asked me to teach you something of the Craft.
I was just thinking, if I had your skin problems, I'd use a good tannisroot ointment. Every night.
Your nightmares are over. I'm taking this back to Argo City where it won't be misused.  You could come too. It might be safer for you.
Yes, I see it. Shining like a jewel.
I know.
What? Palace? Hardly.
I knew it!
No, it's no good---you can't practice--- you only get one go. A thing like that. No. Sure you don't want a sip of this? It's delicious, I think.
Please. I have to get back to Earth. My friends are in trouble. And unless I bring back the Power Source, Argo City will die.
Going to try. Didn't say I could.
Too late. Too late. Save yourself.
There's no vodka in it.
What? What did you tell me?
Hey! Y'know what they used to call me in high school?
Sure, Lana, I'd love to.
It sure is.
Clark, I think you worry too much about mayonnaise.
There's a lot of choices here.
Me neither...
Ride a thresher? Well, I don't know. Girls are trying just about everything now but --
Call me.
Let me do it for you, Mr. White.
We get together sometimes.
Actually, that's why I stopped by. He's realy sorry, he wanted to make it, but then he...ran into a problem.
Say!
I'd better be. Suddenly I've got competition to keep up with.  Your high school reunion article. I though it was terrific. And fascinating.  Especially about the girl back home.  I'll tell you what, Clark, I'll take you to lunch and you can tell me all about it.
Yeah.
Kitchen. . . Technician
Thirty-five.
They said I lost it on the subway, but it ain't the truth! It was a pickpocket took it!
Don't call me a bum! I ain't no bum!
Yeah. A raise . .
Mr. Gorman, just answer me one question...
Black or regular?
Plants. Plants always make an office cozier.
Columbia.
What are you talking about, fella?
Gus, if there's anything I hate, it's greed.
I knew it, I knew it, go be nice to people and they think they can ask for the moon!
For what?
What will it do?
Tell me more...
It looks wonderful. it is wonderful, let's face it.
Yeah, sure.  Ain't nobody gonna stomp my electric train...
Can't wait, pal, can't wait.
I ain't about to argue with you.  What's gonna happen to them three? Ross the boss and those ladies?
We gonna crash?
Just a second.
I was afraid you'd say that.  Hey, is there a bus station around here?
Anytime.
Kent's been invited to his high-school class reunion.
Hey, don't expect me to save you. Because I don't do that anymore.
I'm in no rush.  So what do you have in mind?
No, I don't think I would. So... then what can I do for you?
Why don't you hold your breath, instead? Maybe you'll turn blue. On you that'd be an improvement.
And he use to be such a sweetie pie! What's wrong with him the last two weeks?
How'm I supposed to turn this thing?
My friend, you are yesterday. Whoever pulled this caper is tomorrow.
But if somebody re-programmed it, it could do much more.
Don't cry, Bubba.
Not quite. What is that in the lower right hand corner?
Like fish he is.  I know enough about computers to put a PHD to shame.  Come now, brother dear, you didn't think I was going to let that little man run the show, did you? Gus Gorman telling us what to do -- I'd sooner kiss a pig!
Tourists, about twenty of 'em.
Oh sure. The American answer to everything. Pills.  No, this is --  -- natural.
Of course not. Not when you've got so much going for you.
Sure! But nobody knows it. Least of all you.  Look, would you mind if I gave you some constructive criticism?
But this should be exposed. They get	kids here who are just starting out in life and they take them for every nickel they can get. That's what Perry says.
Superman? Oh, was he here?
Lois, help! I can't --  I can't swim -- !
Well, not in your mind, but maybe . . .deep in your heart . . .
Take it easy. Take a deep breath.
Well, you should. Because I appreciate you, too, you know.
Actually I was trying to catch up on my reading. There's a lot of Dickens I never got around to --
That's why they call 'em terrorists.  Go down to the morgue and dig up anything you can find on past incidents of --
Why am I doing this? Why am I here?
It' s fantastic! ----- This place is genius.
What'd he say before? He saw a girl?
My kind of people.
I mean they can't even trace that guy on that radar they got, every time they try he just flies off.
To ski?
That little black box, Mr. Luthor, I mean -- what's it for?
Revenge! We will kill the son of our jailer!
I must be. But I'm not.  Your home. This is your home.
He ran in fear from us . . .
You'll find out, General! And when you do . . .
DELETE IN CUTTING
What shall we do now?
Yes?
Don't worry. I will draw his fire.  With a few of my own.
I really don't think . . .
No ... Metropolis is a confusing place. Back in Smallville -- my hometown -- everything was more simple. People would sacrifice everything just to lend a helping hand.
Don't tell me you're waiting for lightning to strike. Wide-eyed romantics are an endangered species.
If you say so. Here goes.
Clark. . . !
I don't think we're being treated fairly, Lois. And I'm going to tell Miss Warfield.
I don't think 'fan mail' fits this letter.  Read it, Clark.
Well, I'm feeling a lot better . . . almost chipper . . .  . . . and all because I had a visit from a very good nurse.
Of course it is. Do you know what the sun is? Why it's just one huge nuclear bomb. A bomb with enough radiation to incinerate an average man like . . .  that.
And what am I? A Shriner? No, If you'll join forces with me, together we can make the world safe for war profits again.
Mr. White, come with me I want to see
I know Daddy. I'm worried about him.
Quiet! You'll make him self-conscious.
He has all of Superman's powers. If I've planned it right. . .
Get the box, nephew.
Not how I might have put it, but, correct. The remains I sent to the sun included the creatures genetic memory. He'll remember everything that he experienced. Not to worry. He'll find his way back to me.  Did you hear that?
He's . . .  beautiful. Perfect.
You're just an experiment, freako!
Never. But we have to hide out for a  while. Lay low. Say. . . a couple of years. By then I'll have a new plan.
No . . . it's the way it always is . . . on the brink . . . with good fighting evil.
Bunkers!
We're running out of smoke.
And stop interrupting. his is the big scene.  Your finest hour! You rose to the challenge, baby! And you lost. That's the best part!
Albert!
It was hot, yes.
Anyway, we Kent's don't like showoffs, ain't that so? A body's got to be humble even if he knows that he's better'n his neighbors.
Well!
Unbelievable.
No. I'm just thinking that you smoke too much, if you don't mind my saying so.
Mirrors, then. It's done with mirrors.
Look, there was probably a trampoline on the roof somewhere and this joker just took a big bounce.
I don't know, Lois, but I do know a fraud when I hear one. This thing goes against all natural laws.
Jealous? Of what?
You're not the only one.
Okay.  Take me to your leader.
So it's six hundred feet below Park Avenue, It's still a Park Avenue address.
Criers and complainers! That's what I get! Moaners and groaners! Me, Lex Luthor, who figured out how to live in luxury without ever paying one cent in taxes. Lex Luthor, who built this fantastic kingdom under the sea, so to speak, hidden and undetected by the fools who eke out their miserable lives on the streets above.
You'll be seeing stars in a minute, Miss Teschmacher. y'know?
First the pets, Otis.
Stay and listen!  Besides, it's twelve in the afternoon. This is no time to go to bed.
But if I put my leg out like Claudette Clobert in  --
What if he doesn't show up? What if he's taking a nap?
But so is Vond-El
If you persist, you leave us no choice.
'And the people on the street, the little man who runs the corner newsstand, the old lady sunning herself on the stoop the kids playing stick ball -- none of them will ever forget the night of senseless bloodletting that turned a friendly block part into a nightmare.'
Gets you where you live, huh?
All of us.
Guess I'd better hitch up the rig and come back to get that...that thing he was settin' in. What do you make of that thing? Martha? You listening?
There are none of them any good anyway.
It does, huh?  Clark Kent, I'd like you to meet Lois Lane.
He is. Usually.
Who's Clark? One of your colleagues?
I'd appreciate it if you didn't smoke.
I wouldn't do that. It's against the law.
The reason I can fly is because my molecular structure is so constituted that I have a lighter density under Earth's gravitational force.
Yes. Although I can get a headache just like anyone.
Pink.
Well, I was born on a planet your scientists don't know too much about. It's in the Xeno Galaxy. Or it was. It was called Krypton. That's K-R-Y-P...
I'll never forget you for that, Mr. Luthor.
Oh, Mr. Luthor...
Makes Cecil B. DeMille look like the Senior Class play, right?
Plenty! About 'The Crime of the Century,' Remember?
Sure. It's the joining together of two land masses pushed together eight million years ago. The fault line itself is unstable and always shifting, which is the reason you get earthquakes in the California area from time to time.
On radio waves?
They'll soon be over.
How are you?
I'm fine.  Still working with my father.
And Zoe?  How's Zoe?
Sunnyridge.  That was a long time
Yes.  Do you find there's something strange about this meat?
It turns to steaming piss.
Mitchell.  It was nice to see you again, Ally.
Why not?
C'mon, you know that won't...
No.  It should be dry by now.
It's natural.
Well, maybe that's because they know I'm going to follow them.  Behind the bus.
Well I don't.
Yes.
And what's that?
Did his parents attend to that?
How long has Dolores been driving that bus, Mr. Otto?  How many times has she steered clear of danger? What went wrong that morning?
No.  A little sugar though.
Did he say what about?
What's a ditty again?
Oh.
Yes.
Yes.  Dolores...and even your mom and dad.  But I'll make sure you go last.
Thank you, Nicole.
People who will help our cause.
Wanda and Hartley.  They lost Bear. He was their adopted son.  A beautiful boy.  Indian.
So what's the problem?
No.  But this is.  They wouldn't take my blood.
Yes.  I can hear you breathing too.
I love you, Zoe.  I'll be there soon, and I'll take care of you.  No matter what happens.  I'll take care of you.
You can't come here.
No.
Mrs.  Otto,  there is no such thing as an accident.  The word doesn't mean anything to me.  As far as I'm concerned, somebody somewhere made a decision to cut a corner.  Some corrupt agency or corporation accounted the cost variance between a ten-cent bolt and a million dollar out-of-court settlement.  They decided to sacrifice a few lives for the difference.  That's what's done, Mrs. Otto.  I've seen it happen so many times before.
No.
Can't get off that shitty dump they live on.  What little money comes in goes to booze.
And according to your recollection, there was nothing unusual about the drive that morning?
You remember that much?
Why were you scared?
The speedometer.  And it was downhill there.
Seventy-two miles an hour.
You mean it?
Just the way Dolores gets so excited about bringing the kids to check out the animals.  It's like the biggest thing in her life.
Don't even try to remember.
Well, okay.  I'll take you about nine-thirty in the morning.  That's okay with you?
It's too late for that.  She can't drive the bus anymore.  The school board saw to that right off.
Yeah, right.
It's compensation, Leo, for the marginal life we lead.  Sidney, did you hear the story about the cloak-and-suitor who -- ?
Waiter, the check.  This man is trying to hold a gun to my head!
Is "he" inside?
The next time you want information, Falco, don't scratch for it like a dog - ask for it like a man!
You don't like it, do you.  I think she will accept, but I'm not sure. She may be too dependent on her brother.
I thought you might have a faint idea of how this item originated.
And, instead, he printed his heel in your face?
Give me a chance --
Hurry back.
I'll by that, son.  Now, you owe ME a favor.  Be good to my kid sister...
No, I wouldn't...
Son, lots of people tell me I'm a gifted man, but I still can't see around corners.
He's here, isn't he?  Do you think, sir, when he dies he'll go to the dog and cat heaven?
Right now you're in no position to ask questions!  And your snide remarks---
Those "dears" sound like daggers. May I suggest that you stop DARING her to speak?
I'm trying to get Susie to stand up to you.  But your manner is so threatening that she's afraid to speak!
Did Sidney tell you about it?
I thought we were talking about Sidney?
I'm taking up the situation with you now...
Yes, the Justice, that's right. But I think you had it in the column.
Now don't kid a kidder.
I don't believe it.
You print them, don't you?
Not "we", Sidney, you!
J.J., you said you want to help me - prove it!
With a pocket fulla firecrackers - good.
How does it matter who's sister? The main thing, they're through and -
She knows now.
- He's got them on him.
Yeah...  And another thing - he's gonna say you 'resisted arrest'...  You know J.J....!
And why should I bribe the woman who holds most of my heart?
You're sure.  Find out for me.
Staring.  Consequently, when he approached me on his way out I wasn't surprised, but I didn't let on.
...cigarette girls... And naturally -
That's what I'm thinking, Rita. Maybe...
Can you be there by two-thirty?
And he's a perfect stranger to me.
It isn't.  I've just seen the early edition.
Sid...you got me so...I don't know what...
Why not you?
Good!  We're all off to Utica, so excuse me, Mr. Frannis-on-the- Portisan.
Yes, but why?
Frankly, yes, to my surprise.  He thinks he's very gifted - those boys'll go a big mile, he thinks.
Chickie, I'll have to laugh at that - an attractive girl like you...!
He's intuitive - he knows he's getting fired!
Steve, I'd rather you didn't say anything for a day or two...until I tell my brother...
Susie, I was there for OUR sake, too.  But what a world it would be if we were all afraid to learn to walk and talk because it might offend poppa!  By the way, I think your brother was completely responsible for the smears...
I'm sorry, baby.  This thing is just kicking my ass.  I thought we had it with this one...
You need a break.  You'll see it clear when you come back.
Miles, it's Sunday.  You promised to take the kids to Raging Waters today.
NO!! We're going all the way!  You got that, Dyson?
No one must follow your work.
Not like me.  A T-1000.  Advanced prototype. A mimetic polyalloy.
You are targeted for termination.  The T-1000 will not stop until it complete its mission. Ever.
No.  Only an object of equal size.
It can't form complex machines.  Guns and explosives have chemicals, moving parts.  It doesn't work that way.  But it can form solid metal shapes.
Negative.  The T-1000's highest probability for success now would be to copy Sarah Connor and wait for you to make contact with her.
Of course.  I'm a terminator.
Right.
Cool.
Here.  I wish I coulda met my real dad.
Dyson.
Drive faster.
What?
Yeah, she's a total loser.  C'mon, let's check out the 7-Eleven, whatya say?
No!  Don't kill him!
Go!  I'll finish here.
SHOOT!!!!
Remember the message... the future is not set. There is not fate but what we make for ourselves.
There's 215 bones in the human body, motherfucker. That's one.  Now don't move!
Unknown.
Please continue...
But I promised your mother.
And this, only one of these letters, Major. I have lots of them.
was born here, in Leipzig. I escaped in '36. My parents, they sent me to my uncle in Philadelphia. They were to follow. But they delayed and...
Yes.
I don't know, but the British are excited about it, I know that. The rumour is Hinkel kept a file on every artist working in the Third Reich.
Major Richards said he'd call to let us know.
Yeah.
With more what? More what?
A human being, oh, good, I'm relieved, I thought you were going to say you were a music lover. This man, this great artist has made anti-Semitic remarks like you wouldn't believe. I got letters.
Not yet.
That's why he didn't get the hell out of here when he had the chance! I put that to him, he couldn't answer. Why didn't he go and direct in America, like that Italian, Toscanini.
Then you're going to kill me.
Yes.
I received a telegram from Hermann Goering informing me that he had made me a Privy Councillor. I was not given the opportunity either to accept or refuse. After the dreadful events of November 1938, the violent attacks on the Jews, I stopped using the title.
I need to work. I need to make my living. I live off the generosity of friends...
I believe it was because of another letter I'd written to Goebbels lamenting the decline of musical standards due to racial policies.
If you are going to bully me like this, Major, you had better do your homework. You obviously have no idea how impertinent and stupid your questions are.
Certainly not, but I knew he had informers everywhere. Even in my orchestra there was someone
No!
This is absolute nonsense!
No, I'm not going to stop it. Hitler himself offered you a beautiful house and a personal bomb shelter.
But you see what I'm getting at? You get a gorgeous house, you're highly paid. What are you gonna do, stay or leave? One voice comes back at me: stay!
That's what I asked.
Do you know what's in this archive?
The one he kept in his right hand. Yes, you remember.
How could I forget?
So. You wanted to see me.
One-zero-four-nine-three-three- one. Or d'you mind if I just call you 'one'?
Who's he?
Yes, Dr. Furtwängler was absolutely clear about this: politics and art must be kept separate.
Nope.
Hey, hey, slow up, Fraulein Straube has to take down what you say.
The pay's the same but you'll make more in tips.
I won't let the fat kid down.
You know your weapons, buddy.
Great.
Hey, I'm not stupid, y'know. They can't build anything like that yet.
White light.  Pain.  Like being ripped inside out... slowly.  Like being born, maybe.
It was an honor.  A chance to meet the legend.  Sarah Connor.  Who taught her son to fight...organize, prepare. From when he was a kid.  When you were in hiding, before the war.
Come on, me? The mother of the future?  Am I tough? Organized?  I can't even balance my checkbook.  I cry when I see a cat that's been run over... and I don't even like cats.
About where you're from.
Let's get cleaned up, Kyle.
What's that?
What about it?
Good fighters.
You're not supposed to.
Yes.
Then how are you supposed to get back?
Why?
Most official records were lost in the war.  The computer knew almost nothing about Connor's mother.  Her name. Where she lived, just the city. No scanner pictures.  The Terminator was just being systematic.
Who is in authority here?
I won't.  Now just relax. Where are you?  Yeah, I know it...on Pico. Are you alright?
I just called.
Projections were far too optimistic.
Our E.P.S. was one fifty last quarter.  We're up eight cents per share.
Will you really hold me to it over <u>pennies</u>?
The stock will turn.
Then, you kiss his ass.
I don't understand why they're getting you involved.
Are you suggesting we wait till someone finds us?
You're a grown man.  I'm not responsible for you.
Me?  You're the one who... !  Shit!
Why... ?
If this was my office, I wouldn't keep that closed.
Is this you?
What's wrong?
No cops.  I've got a warrant out. Mail fraud.  They'll take me in, but you won't be able to prove anything else.
I know things... like who you can trust.  Like that your brother was in on it from the beginning.
How?  How could they have gotten anything?
I didn't say anything.
Scams, con games.  How many?
... what... ?
What are you doing?
I saw them kill him!
I don't need anything from you.  I was laying on a beach somewhere in Spain, naked, and, it hit me -- Nickie's birthday.  So, here I am, four layovers, twenty-seven hours flying and one donkey ride later. Not necessarily in that order.
Why?
I said I would...
I'm going to call.
It's a flat tire.  That's all.
You're part of it...
No, it doesn't!  Those keys were put there.  I didn't even know...
This... ?  Oh, this is just... this is the bill.
Robbed?
Have you gone to the police?
Of course you can have it if you need it.  Can I get you something to eat?
There's nothing to forgive.
I hope.
What is?
A game?
Do you really expect me to participate without knowing a single thing?
Don't worry.  It's been terrific spending the entire day with your "crack team".
How do I find them?  Their offices are empty.
What whistle?  There's no fucking whistle.  This is fucking dangerous.
What are you gonna do anyway?  You won't get your money back.
Like, this way... sort of...
Let's get you dried off first.  I might have some clothes below.
Was he morose, or...?  I mean...
Sometimes I wonder how much of him there is in me.
Let me think...  Hordes of men in tuxedos.  Everyone's droning.  Ludwell's trying to break the ice by reciting an off-color limerick...
Because, if you don't know about society, you don't have the satisfaction of avoiding it.
I know who she is.  Take a message.
A Mister... Seymour Butts.
Why are you following me?
Nice touch.  Does the game use real bullets... ?
Sounds like they make tennis rackets. What do we know?
You're joking.
You warm my heart.
Go ahead.
You could have.
No.
Where in the hell can she be.
And that will be a good place to end this study.
And after she was thrown out, she needed a job.
No, but she does, and that's all that matters.
Yes, because someone was always keeping me awake.  Ever since I was little.  That was my job.  I took care of my mother and I had to be there for her all night long, and she woke up all the time.  And after she died, well, it's been a few months, but I still, I still wake up, it's... a habit.  I know we've only known each other a couple of hours, but I'm really glad to be with people who let me talk about this.  I'm really happy to be here with you.
Theo I think.  You've asked us that three times, Doctor Marrow. What's going on?
In the bathroom in my mother's room, the toilet was next to an old wooden table.  It smelled like that wood.
I wish I were.  I wish I had done it, then I could confess and you'd be at peace.  That great moral philosopher Frank Sinatra once said to someone he loved, I wish you had an enemy, so I could beat him up.
Nell, the first time I ever spoke with you in person was the night we met here.
My mother used to hum this to me. Like her mother hummed it to her. And my great grandmother Carolyn hummed it to her.
That?  That's Hill House.
Yes.  It's perfect, isn't it?
There were no children.  Rene died, and <u>then</u> Hugh Crain built all of this, and then he died. His heart was broken.
Mary came with me.
It's okay... we're all here...
I'll take her with me to the University tomorrow.  I can't believe I read the test wrong.  I didn't see anything that looked like she was suicidal.
That's a good question.  What is it about fences?  Sometimes a locked chain makes people on both sides of the fence just a little more comfortable.  Why would that be?
Why would we --
It's all I could afford.
A blank canvas!  I could paint your portrait, directly on you. Or maybe not.  So, you?  Husbands? Boyfriends?  Girlfriends?  Where do you live?
Maybe he never came in.  If he'd come in, he would have left his bags at the door, right?  Or maybe he got here early, and went for a walk, and fell.  Maybe he's outside.
There's hundreds of them.  This must be a record of the children who died at the mills, like Luke said.
Me too.  Although I learned one thing about you, that you don't know about yourself.  You can be a pretty decent bitch.
I don't think I want any.
Come on!  Why are we waiting?
Just had to be sure.
Is that a problem?
All your life.  That happened while I swam the length of my pool.
Just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time.
Come over here.
Where do we go?
Fuck you, Mr. whatever-your-name is. This is a lifestyle I embrace.
Why, because you're my security consultant?  This cocksucker nearly burnt my house down.
And where is this guest?  Don't they want to interview him.
You could use a few of my prime shitkickers up here.
There's already gonna be talk about how people close to you keep falling into canyons.
Let him break - he likes to break.
It was better than a telegram.
No, but between the lines, eh? Mysterious circumstances, and that.
I think you didn't get that lot in the Navy, doing your National Service.
Nick's a nick, n' it?  No matter what state you're in.  State of remorse, most likely -- for gettin' caught.
What do I do, then, look in the bleedin' Yellow Pages?
And that's where you met Jenny.
Gate's open.  I had a butcher's at the house.
Butcher's hook.  Look.  I don't much reckon those minders of his.
Extra muscle.  Bodyguards.
See what I mean?  Wearing bloomin' uniforms n' all.
<u>Valets</u>.  They park cars.  He's having a party.
Faith.
Not much -- you?
Really.
Well, those are the breaks.
Sarcastic, moi?  Maybe I'll mellow when my ship comes in.  It's expected any day now.  I'm all packed and ready to go.
Three seasons.  They found that's the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of Mormons on the Chisum Trail.  I was wife number three -- the ingenue.
Now who's being sarcastic?
How'd you manage that, then.
Nah, accommodation address.
Well, I gathered something from the article what Eddie sent me.  Some sort of pop music producer, wasn't it.
This and that.  Y'know.  Ways and means.
What do you think.
You think Terry gave me access to her things?  Probably sold her clothes.
You don't know how I've compromised my standards.
Still, there have been rewards.  It's sunny.  And some of the producers who call even have credits.
We were <u>lucky</u> to be nicked.  Me and the lads went down there Sunday evening, we weren't discovered till the Monday.  Good job we were still breathing.
Hey?
I'll tell ya something:  it made me a model prisoner.  Put me right off any escape attempts.  Tunnel my way to freedom after that experience?  Not bloody likely.
Get seven years, did you?
Honest.  Didn't know where to look till I was 21.
I've 'ardly ever left it.
What about your grandmother?
What'd your father do?
Look, mush, you're the guv'nor here, I can see that, I'm on your manor now, right.  So there's no need to get out of your pram.  I'm Johnny-come-lately to all this.  Whatever the bollocks between you and this slag Valentine, it's got nothing to do with me.  I don't wanna know.
Nothing financial.  Strictly personal.  I can see how all this import-export malarkey might give rise to confusion where I'm concerned.  A foreigner, showing up unexpectedly, like.
All of what?
He's always been very forward-thinking. He invested wisely.
Nine years?  Is that legal?
Five thousand.
I don't know.
I happen to know more about Mr. Whatever- his-name-is than he thinks I know about him and his operation.
Like he'd never hire me for real.  Not week-to-week.  I don't have the credentials.  He thinks I'm just a sociopath, someone he can turn to when he needs "plausible denial."
I don't know who that English guy is. Some kind of --  -- courier or something.  Maybe a seller. Maybe a buyer.  But Mr. <u>Avery</u> wanted him, those jigs wanted him -- and I betcha there's a briefcase somewhere.
Yeah.  I know her, all right.  She came down here once, stirred up a shitstorm. We lost a full day's work, took me weeks to get back on schedule.  If she hadn't a' been Terry's woman I would've broke her jaw.  'Course, she's nobody's problem now.
Listen, get the fuck out of here before you get hurt.  Who the fuck do you think you are, waltzing in here, asking questions?
-- You know his name is Frank.
Who's looking for you?
I don't.
Well, sure, I guess. Pop says so too. I work pretty hard at school.
He didn't say that.
Huh. Yeah. Maybe...
No. Uh... family friend.
Did she make mistakes?
That right.
Cash.
Look, uh... Creighton...
And I've never been asked--Look, you want the dough back? You know who I am! You--
OK. Take your coat, Ann?
Hell, I, I'm not proud of it. But, uh, that's not the worst of it. I got a note. A blackmail note. You know, come across or everybody knows.
But it's...
Who?
How's that?
You don't have to--
Don't tell 'em anything. We're getting you Freddy Riedenschneider.
Nah, don't say anything. I'm alright.
...OK.
I took Doris's keys.
I tried to tell him the whole story, but Riedenschneider stopped me. He said the story made his head hurt, and anyway he didn't see any way of using it without putting me on the hot seat for the murder of Big Dave...
Well, there's Lloyd Garroway in San Francisco. Probity--you know, no one ever said anything iffy about Lloyd Garroway. Conservative. Jury might like that. Might like that here.
Uh-huh. Some beat, huh?
Huh?
Yeah.
Now, being a barber is a lot like being a barman or a soda-jerk; there's not much to it once you've learned the basic moves. For the kids there's the Butch, or the Heinie...
Come on, Eddie, you're gonna scare the kid.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Hello, Walter.
No thanks, I--
Hello.
Well, have you ever considered tar Macadam? People think it's just for public works and commercial purposes, roads, parking lots, so forth...
It's too late now.  Guests are arriving.  The Mayor's car is pulling up.
Get his gun and his walkie talkie, Jonathan.  Move.
I have to help Pendergast.  Kawakita and Jonathan stay with me.  The rest of you can go with Cuthbert!
To the left twice then five no... sorry... I think it's fifteen... it's been a while...
Eight to the right!  Look!  I found it!
Can't really focus on birds at the moment, Pendergast.  I'm tryin' to keep my breakfast down.
So the method of death is the only connection?
I believed them.
If you don't mind a suggestion, you might try a saliva test.
The sub-basement?
The sub-basement, huh?  Great idea.
I'm one of the few who know every inch it, now that John is gone.
The virus itself might have positive applications.  They'll keep the plants in secure lock up while the studies are made.  Greg isn't joining us?
Not so loud.
Let me help.  I can take care of everything.
My work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you.
I'm not giving up.
Cuthbert's counting on the exhibition's success.  The museum is in debt.  Contributions and public funding have dried up.  Admissions no longer cover overhead.  The last big infusion of cash we had was the King Tut exhibit.  Cuthbert was hired to get us out of the red.  If the Superstition Exhibit isn't lucrative, he'll have to start auctioning off some of these gems.
Margo, what you've just described is a killing machine.
Some kind of power failure.  Maybe it's the storm.  Do you have a flashlight?
I wouldn't be so sure.
He's right.
Evolutionary Biologist.  I study how life on earth evolved over millions of years.
She's never going to take us to see the dinosaurs.  That lady said they were on the fourth floor.
They were green eyes and they were slit like a lizard's.
Keep the light up.  I can't see.
Another storage room.
Keep the animal quiet.
Margo, you haven't heard?
Someone's been murdered.  Not shot, strangled or stabbed, either.  Torn limb from limb.  There's talk of a psychotic killer or even an animal.
So what?
Eats them?
How about lunch?
You were going to be married.
What if Whittlesley arrived on the tepui and no monster was there?  Was he desperate enough to create one?
I don't know.
All right.  This is hard for me.  I'm a scientist.  I like order and logic. Sometimes too much.  There's got to be an explanation.  There can't be an animal in there.  But I saw something.
When DNA is defective, it often uncontrollably replicates long repeating sequences of the same base pair.  Viruses can damage DNA.  So can radiation, certain chemicals.  Even cancer.  Let's let the G.S.E. sort it out.  I have to get started.  This will take several hours.
No.  A chromium alloy tipped .45 caliber bullet bounced off that thing's skull like a spit ball.  I think it was bothered by my light.
What are you going to do?
It's scared of me.
I think... for the pleasure of the kill.
I can't!
<i>Fiji.</i>
I'm sorry, er...the biggest one.
One.
Why wouldn't I?
It doesn't matter.  I'll make other arrangements.
No, hold back...
What have we missed?
As you know ratings have never been our primary goal.  I imagine we'll lose those voyeurs only interested in witnessing Truman's latest torment.  However, I'm certain that our core audience will remain loyal.
It has to be the reality.
Of course, his eagerness to leave his mother's womb also meant he was the one selected.
Let's take another call.  London, England, you're on "Tru Talk."
<i>You</i> were real.  That's what made you you so good to watch.
That's right.  Lauren.
I'm sorry.  It's not up to me.
Now.
Yeah?  Outta what?
Nursery?
<i>Mixed up?</i>  Mixed up in what?
How about them?
I told you I can't.
It's a lot of world for one man.  You sure that's not wishful thinking, you wishing you'd made something more of yourself? Christ, Truman, who hasn't sat on the John and had an imaginary interview on "Seahaven Tonight"?  Who hasn't wanted to be somebody?
What's that?
They're...  perfect.  Thank you.
--I figure we could scrape together eight thousand.
I still want to look over a couple of things.
Good night, Mother.
Put some butter on it--or ice?
You blaming me for the traffic?
I've changed my mind again.  What's New Orleans like this time of year?  Mardi Gras.  Or let's just see where the road takes us.
There's been an accident, Truman.
Do something...
Truman, stop it!
Well, I made it through another night.
It was Dad, I swear, dressed like a homeless man.  And you know what else was really strange?  A businessman and a woman with a little dog appeared from nowhere and forced him onto a bus.
Leak at the plant.  They had to shut her down.
There's no one here.
I don't understand.
Not bad.  I just won the State Lottery.
Sorry. Don't have one.
Yes. I know.
Yes.
Strughold. He's just gotten on a plane in Tunis.
Kurtzweil, we think.
Show you right on a map.
Standing around holding your yank while bombs are exploding.
No. They put the bomb in the building across the street because it DID have federal offices. The Federal Emergency Management Agency had a provisional medical quarantine office there. Which is where the bodies were found. But that's the thing...
When we were young men in the military, your father and I were recruited for a project. They told us it was biological warfare. A virus. There were rumors about its origins.
A transportation system. Transgenic crops. The pollen genetically altered to carry a virus.
Your guess?
I think they have that covered.
What happened to playing a hunch?
It's locked?
Something sweet.
All I told them was the truth.
Get dressed, Scully.
Just get dressed. I'll explain on the way.
You're telling me the cause of death on the report is false. That this man didn't die from an explosion, or from flying debris.
I can't really talk right now.
That I don't know. But if it's through simple contact of blood to blood, and if it doesn't respond to conventional treatments, it could be a serious health threat.
This is where he marked on the map, Scully. Where he says those fossils were unearthed.
All the equipment is brand new.
They haul gas in tanker trucks, they haul oil in tanker trucks -- they don't haul viruses in tanker trucks.
I hear the humming. Like electricity. High voltage maybe.
You saved me, Scully.  As different and frustrating as it's been sometimes, your goddamn strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times; have kept me honest and made me whole. I owe you so much, Scully, and you owe me nothing.  I don't want to do this without you. I don't know if I can. If I quit now, they win.
Something's wrong...  I'm having -- lancinating pain -- my chest. My... motor functions are being affected. I'm...
Where are we?
But it's not the lives we saved. It's the lives we didn't.
How deep does this go?
I'm not taking any chances.
I have answers for you.
A weak vaccine against the virus Agent Scully has been infected with. It must be administered with ninety six hours.
No. Though I have no way to prove otherwise. The virus is extraterrestrial. We know very little about it, except that it is the original inhabitant of this planet.
The only true survivors of the viral holocaust will be those immune to it: those vaccinated against it and human/alien hybrids. Your father arranged for your sister's abduction. He allowed her to be taken to an alien hybrid program, so that she would survive. As a clone.  He had different hopes for you. That you would uncover the truth about the Project. That you would stop it. That you would fight the future.
Dr. Kurtzweil is in the trunk.
Driver.
What alien environment?
A pocketful of rye...
Mocky-Lock is a pain in the ass.
Lucien Baines?
If we reverse the feed and bring Edward into your mind, it could be devastating for him.  Imagine the shock of suddenly existing in a whole other world.
Why did we stop?
No.  No.
You don't know the procedure.
Just like we all have fantasies, right? Things only we know, that we don't share.
You're the shrink, you tell me.
This is going to sound terrible, but... I don't think she matters anymore.  Not to him.  He never finished her.  The others...he was able to make them his.
What difference does it make...?
Like hell "wait."
Little boy?!  That's him!
I told you.  You have to be optimistic. Believe in them...
All yours.  My boss says it's one of the strangest requests the Bureau's ever had.
I got it.
Mocky-Lock.
They took care of that, thank you, Henry.
Initiating connection.
Pump in two liters of pure oxygen, please Henry.
Yes.
Prevacid.  For my stomach.
No.
I am.  I'm a pretty boring guy.
Awaiting his arrival.
Grandparents.  Live over in Davis.
She remembers because it was her "dream truck."  Wanted one just like it.
Tell you what.  If this thing burns us, I take that heat.  I give you permission to point your finger at me and say "It was all his idea."
Sit down.
I don't know. How can you know a thing like that afterwards. I don't know anything any more.
Yes.
Whiskey.
Just another part I've got to learn.
In German?
Comedy. I don't play tragedy.
Where is she?
Be sensible - tell Major Calloway.
I don't know.
He told you, didn't he?
I shall be all right.
He's safe in the Russian zone.
I saw him today.
If you want to sell your service, I'm not willing to be the price... I loved him. You loved him. What good have we done him. Look at yourself, they have names for faces like that.
From Kurtz. They have just been arrested. But Harry won't come, he's not a fool.
Yes.
We loved each other, do you mean that?
No.
It wasn't important.
What did you say? I'm sorry...
I don't know.
Austrians aren't allowed in your hotel. Couldn't we meet at the Mozart cafe?
I'll carry a copy of one of your books. Harry gave it to me.
Can I have that woman's passport?
Martins.
Once in a while.
Best thing that ever happened...
Ever seen one?
Well, you could say that murder was part...
Going to find me the real criminal? It sounds like one of your stories.
A bruised lip.
In Vienna...
I'm not asking you to.
I'll do what I can, if she'll let me.
Nonsense. Your novels are very popular here. Aren't they, Sergeant?
Oh, I thought you would know, you're a writer. Of course you do. Good night, old man.
What is it, Sergeant?
Well, well, they seem to've been giving you quite some busy time.
It's good to see you, Holly.
She's been arrested.
I told the police.
You wouldn't do anything.
Why not?
Coffee.
Here?
A Roumanian.
All right - I'm mad. I've seen a ghost...
Mr. Lime - yes.
You saw it?
Der ami macht mich noch ganz deppert. I should have listened to my wife. She said you were up to no good. Gossip.
Not the sort of thing I should confess to a total stranger, but you have to break the rules sometimes. Humanity's duty.
Richard. Hi.
Here.
Traveler.
We're ok.
We swim.
One night I will get the perfect photograph.
Incredible.
So?
I think the whole Jewish people were permanently scarred by what happened on Mt. Moriah, and we still live in terror....
They sound like you.
He's an asshole.
What??
Then I won't bring you....
We'll go to the country sometime, okay?
Danny, it's true. There were no six million. At most, two hundred thousand Jews died in the camps. And the majority of them were from disease and --
I don't, but...
How come you don't know it?  How can you say you hate the Jews when you don't know anything about --
Why the fuck not?
I have a job.
I don't care about money.
At first, no one will know why the victims are being killed.
You weren't complaining about my play last time.
I stole it. From a synagogue.
Why not?
Good question. Both.  Aleph...
V'asitem...
Nothing but nothingness...Judaism's not about belief.
You shouldn't.
Do they?
'Cause he wasn't a rabbi.
Lina, come here!
And be crushed.
You eat first, then you light.  Once you light, it's Yom Kippur, which means you're fasting, so you can't...eat.
You gotta get out of here.
I doubt it. How did you find out?
We need intellectuals, we have enough thugs already.
They're liars and cowards.
What about Curtis Zampf?
In the movement -- the racialist movement -- we believe there's a hierarchy of the races. Not just in IQ, but in the civilization, the art, the forms of government, the civilizations that each race produces... Why are you writing this down if you're recording it?
Sexuality??? What do you mean?
What's that go to do with...I've gone out with a, with Jewish women. Why?
Why?
Danny, what makes you think you know all this?
So, fine, it's not that the Jew, the Jews own the media and the banks. It's that they're sexually corrupt.
He says you were bar mitzvahed there, in March 1988.
To discredit me. Because I know who they are. Look, I thought I explained it to you. Those people can say or do anything. And they will. It's all narrative to them, it's... Are you going to print what this guy said?
It's slander. It's reckless disregard. I'll sue you and your fucking Jew paper.
Get the fuck away from me.
Yes!
Daniel Balint.
I was going to ask you the same thing.
Steve...
They're not my people....
Oh, he decides? Hitler's the chief rabbi now?...
What kids?...
Nobody ever beat me up.  Look, Linda, there're fifty reasons. Even if you knew them all, there'd be another fifty you didn't know.
No, it's weird, man. Nobody knows where he went.
I'm not hungry.... Come on, let's drive around.... We don't want to be spotted here.
You said they didn't have night guards.
So what do we do with the device?
Seven-thirty tomorrow evening.
Yeah, uh... So how are you? What's going on?
Wow, that's uh...great...
Get out of my way.
What are you trying to say?
Okay, that's it. You're going back to --
And that's when the Mets started to stink.
Linda says you're not supposed to have dairy.
Fund-raising??
EAT SHIT, ASSHOLES....
None whatsoever. But I have to admit, I'm not terribly surprised.
Curtis is always more complicated than he seems. Even now.
... I'm pregnant, Bonita!
Very much, I think.  But, there's going to be a problem.
Sorry.  Of course not, definitely not... well, maybe a little.  What did you say?
What d'you mean?
The documents are forged.
Will that interfere with my getting maternity leave?  I'm pregnant.
Yes, isn't it wonderful?  I'm so happy.  I'll bet I'm the happiest pregnant fired person in the world!
Johana Cross, pleased to meet you.  Well!  Isn't this a coincidence. I really wasn't expecting this... All the way out here.  It's incredible!
No.
Enzo, stop bitching, will you?
Damn it!  Why won't you give me a straight answer, for once?!
Noireuter.
Because I'm sure you're dying to beat me.
That's too easy!  Every time I beat a record there's always some dumbshit asking me:  "D'you know that French guy, Mayol?  He's supposed to be very good!  Too bad he doesn't compete." So, you're going to come with me to Taormina! First, because you're my friend and second, because you don't have one reason to keep on spoiling my pleasure.  ... I'll see you there...
You don't have a room?  Paolo?  What did I just hear?  I personally called you to reserve a room for my good friend Jacques Mayol and you treat him like a stranger?!
What?
No... It depends... Sometimes they are... What, exactly do you want to know?
... I'm listening.
You don't need a stretcher to take her with you.  You know that, don't you?
No problem, I enjoy talking in my sleep.
... Yes.
Enzo, don't be angry.  I was lucky... that's all.
We can't dive anymore.  They want to cancel the competition for a while.
... both.  Did I just see a man in a red suit and goggles?
I thought it was a nice place.  Isn't it?
I guess... But you know... I'm American and I've mostly been taught to be competitive... There's always pleasure of being the best?
Only to help the medics, I assure you.
I did?
I got fired.
I'm still here.
No... tell me.
It's nothing.  Just the long trip. I'm a little jet-lagged.
The whale!  How could I forget? Always was something fishy about that woman!
I hope they remembered to take the microwave this time?
Oh Jesus...!  I'll make some coffee.  They left the stove.
Don't be a jerk.  There's no such thing as love at first sight.
Way past it.
No.  I'm just depressed.
I know, I know!  I'm a terrible person...  It's... I'm so damn, damn sad.
It's Esther. Santa's got her.
He must be behind that curtain. Relax. We're undercover. We need to give off the appearance of calm. You see Esther, the trick to undercover work is to try and blend in. Act as a Gentile would.
Now we wait for Santa to make his next move.
Maybe we should try a different kind of dancing.
Oh, she said that, did she? What else did Mommy Dearest have to say?
No. No. We're gonna argue. And you know what mom? I'm going to save Hanukkah just to spite you. And when my face is all over the television. When your friends are opening their Hanukkah gifts next year, don't mention it to them, okay? I wouldn't want you to have to show my picture.
Well I'm just glad you're safe Bubba Shaina, and eating by your mother for Shabos.
...So you saved Hanukkah Mr. Big Shot. I mean, let's be honest Mordechai, it isn't even one of the high holidays.
She said to remind you that you're having Shabat dinner by her tomorrow and also to remind you to bring the Manischewitz.
He's still working out some identity issues.
The alarm will trigger if the system detects any Non-W.A.S.P. tendencies inside the building. For example, if you were to dribble a basketball, or eat watermelon, or use the word dawg...that is, spelled with an aw as opposed to the letter o...within the confines of this workshop, the alarm would sound.
In fact, he's just informed me that he personally plans on cancelling Christmas this year.
Hah! Jewish guilt. Well, it won't work on me Hammer. I'm too strong for it.
Who's Carlos Dom-what's-his-name?
Drink your beer and don't get so excited.
But he admitted quick enough that it killed the first girl.
No. I'm serious about this.
Look, Charlie, you didn't do it, and you know you didn't.
They're fools. Why don't they let Charlie How-Come hunt it alone. He's an Indian.
Who?
Tomorrow -
You must say that you went to take some of the roses to your father's grave...
Rosita  I have wondered -
Yes. It's always fascinated me.  You know, once, when I was a youngster, I went to see Mrs. Leslie Carter in "Zaza." After the play I stood in the alley just to watch her come out.
Of course. It's the way any decent man would feel in your position.
No. I'm quite sure.
Yes?
About Charlie's leopard?
Just barely possible - - yes.
I don't mean that. How would he act? What would he do?
Couldn't you tell a man like that when you saw him?
Why do yo&amp;i accuse me? You don't know what you're doing -- you don't understand -- nobody understands --
I didn't want to kill, but I had to. I heard her in the cemetery - talking to the man in the auto --
To know where that leopard went -  I'm afraid you'd have to be a leopard and think like a leopard. I was a naturalist. That hardly qualifies me as an expert in hunting down lost leopards. I used to teach zoology in a little freshwater college back East. I gave that up.
No - really, I can see them -- they're coming now - turn off the lights 
Go on foot.
Let me get one thing clear. Did Galbraith make a direct accusation?
Professional hunters, who rid the state of cougars.
Yes. And I am taking it to headquarters for examination.
No. I thought that might be just a little corny. I want you to lead him in on a leash.
Look, Kicks, have I ever done anything to hurt you?
Kiki - he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
The red dress?  No. My black one. Then I'll be just like him.
And I suppose you don't feel bad!
And not a sign of the leopard?
I know. Funerals.
Maybe I want to feel badly.
I'm no detective. I don't even know how to begin. All I know is I want to do something about all this.
That's funny -- I never knew you to lose that much before --
Kiki, Galbraith said something to me once, -- something you ought to know. We were talking and he said that people were like that ball on the fountain at the hotel --they got pushed around by things bigger than themselves. That's the way it was with us -- and we were too small to see it that way.
Perhaps it wasnt so brave of him. Had I been here I just might have given him his money, Mr Lombard. One can reap rewards from the strangest of conduct, as someone in your line of work ought to know.
I dont know. He seems to delight in so much sisterly love, he might become determined.
Now you are confusing me, Mrs De Moraes.
Excuse me?
Perhaps I should come back when youre...
Couldnt Nazi hunters do the job?
Well, I found a little more than that. Let me put it this way:...  Last night I thought your brother might be dead, tonight Im convinced he is. That said, I have no evidence and I advise you to let the police deal with it.
You watched the tape?  Friedman and his people dont just provide little kids and videotapes, Mrs De Moraes. Theyre in the import-export business. They run hotels here in London which they probably use as ware- houses and ports of call for their merchandise.
Arent you curious to know about Friedman?
You... You are out of order, Mr Lombard. I...
You knew he had nothing to do with your brothers disappearance, didnt you?
Good.
Why do I feel I neednt answer that?
Here we go again.
My husband didnt need to slap me about, Mr Lombard. I volunteered...
What are you doing? You cant. I...
We? You and your parents killed your husband?
Your flunkey said he was expected back tonight.
On... Once...  Once... What are we... you going to do?
A call box? Thats odd. Where exactly?
French people need a visa to enter this country. That takes time and I didnt have any. I used a British passport. My names not Lamont but Lombard. Xavier Lombard.
The Mondrian, room 504. I was checked out in my absence.
Yeah.
Hah... What about Nathalie?
Yeah. Goodnight, Emily.
That-that wont do. Thats not the way it goes. You saw it, you tell it, thats the way...
And losing you, wed lose him. And that would be a shame, dont you agree?
Emily...
Shell be alright. Shes tough...
Where is the Austrian? Is Friedman the Austrian?
What?
I dont know...  This is just a delivery place, man! I swear I dont know where the kids are... I work for Martin, thats all. Martin knows. He works for Friedman. He knows...
Just me...  Martins gone back to the Ambassador. Look...
B-Black...
Ill call again.
I certainly did, sir...
How are you, Jane?
That are called Rommel or something, I guess not that many.
Well, I hope youre not too heartbroken and...
Yes. How did...
May I ask if you are Jewish, Mr Lombard?
Recommended?
Then you should not have sought an explanation.
Anything at all?
No. In Hampstead... Why?
Shut up and drive!
Money talks, bullshit walks, whether you like it or not.
Maybe you should. Think about it. Those who can afford our goods do their thing without upsetting anyone. Those who cant do it to kids from the streets or their own family and it makes upsetting headlines.
Boys like the one you met today are surplus. Commodities worth a handful of notes in whatever arsehole of the world they happen to be born into. We improve some lives buying them where theyre not wanted, improve still more selling them where they are. Is that too hard for you?
I told you... The rabble, its me...  Huh... Its sad.
Dying without ever reaching the top...
Yeah.
An Austrian.
Questions can amount to revelations. Now, Id hate to think I was made to come here carrying a substantial amount of money in order to be subjected to a cross- examination. Mr Friedman led me to believe we had a deal. Do we?
Can I get up now?
Good reasons?
Yes...You-youre not going to take Shiva away?
Oh, I... She just moved. Ive got her new... Its in my book in the kitchen. Wait... Thank you.
Yes. Three thousand pounds. I still...
... No. In fact, Id seen him a couple of months earlier. He was quite depressed. His work wasnt getting anywhere. He said he was going to try something new, realism, London in the nineties - documentary stuff, you know...
Id appreciate it if I could use your phone.
Cinq cents.
Tu sais où me trouver.
Alors quoi?
Glucks dead, you sonofabitch!
The acid bath?
If he had, youd be dead.
Thats the beauty. An anonymous call. Makes you wonder how many people know what youre up to, eh, French-fuck?
Some guy called to let him know the Frenchman whod called the night before he left London was in L.A. looking to kill him. He did his sums and decided to take the call seriously.
Their last suspected kill occurred two years back, though your Spitzes now probably do no more than bankroll the group. Still, Id watch my step. These people are well-connected, Laurent; former Israeli prime minister, etc. The ladys also president of an international Zionist organisation... Anyway, you get the picture.
Its a good guess...
Let someone else pretend to be you, and see if...
My lord, I'm not sure that...
Louis... water and fresh straw!
Right.  Raymond... a priest.
Now?
This I can do.  I was studying at the University of Paris -- till the English invaded it.
Jeanne, you've been badly wounded...
What... what do you mean?
But I hear so many voices... one voice saying one thing, another voice saying the opposite -- love your enemy, kill your enemy -- what is good, what is evil...?
But how do you know what you hear is the truth?
Tell me...
Just give me a moment and then you'll be free...
You don't know what you're saying. You're going to leave this place, Jeanne -- you're going home -- or whatever you want -- you're going to be happy, and have children, and...
Sound the retreat...
To avoid killing anyone.
So sometimes you were carrying just your sword?
Oh yes, my lady.  All true kings of France must first be anointed in our great cathedral of Rheims... with the holy oil of Clovis... for it was within these very walls that Saint Remy received the sacred oil from Heaven, brought to him by a white dove for the anointing of King Clovis...
We want her burned as a witch!
... and your prerogative is to find her guilty...
Well what are you waiting for? You've got a castle full of racks and ropes and pulleys:  go and torture the bitch!
Where... where am I?
What about you?
It seems that the English care more about you than the French.
My name is Jeanne.  My little cross I had round my neck was taken away from me.  I would like to have it back.
Many things...
So it is the Church Militant that refuses to confess me, and so prevents me from being a good Christian?
And may I go to Mass?
You think?
I assure you, Charles, the Maiden has no greater admirer than myself. But whatever our personal feelings, we cannot allow her to conduct her own private war.  For the sake of the kingdom, it is imperative that you stop her going to Compiegne...
He said that I have to save France from her enemies and give her back to God, and He told me that I -- Jeanne -- will lead you to the altar at Rheims to be crowned King of France.
Well... we are, of course, enormously grateful for your past efforts, but your task is done.  Now it's time for negotiation... and after many months of skillful work, our dear Tremoille is about to seal a treaty with our Burgundian friends who will no longer lend their support to the English.  You see, my dear Jeanne... as it is written in the Bible, "to everything there is a season:  a time for war, and a time for peace"...
My astrologers assure me that the hour is p-p-propitious -- Leo, with Virgo rising.  Have you ever noticed on the astrological chart how the Virgin is next to the Lion?
Noooo!
If there was, I didn't see it...
I must offer to the Duke.  I will give you his answer tomorrow.
The wind will be against us...
I know what I'm doing, so either lend a hand or go back to bed!
No good?  This is a disaster!
I don't think.  I leave that to God. I'm nothing in all this, I'm just the messenger.
But the bridge has been pulled down!
But... where is Dunois... where are the men the king promised me?
It was just... more convenient as I was among soldiers...
I... submit to Our Lord.
It seems to me that the Church and Our Lord are one and the same.  Why must you complicate what is so simple?
No...
That's now what I meant...
Yes, but...
Then, Lord Dunois, show me the way to the other side of the river...
God knows, but it was a bad idea!
I'd sooner die than use magic!
What's the use?  The drawbridge is up!
... the smell of victory, Jeanne! Mmmmmmm!  I love it!
Jeanne... get up... this is ridiculous...
Yes... a half-steed... white.
My king.
And you look pretty wealthy for a servant of God, wouldn't you say?
WHO ARE YOU TO DECIDE IF YOU SHOULD LIVE OR DIE?
And what exactly is it that you can't take anymore of?
No, I do not think so.  I don't think that killing each other will ever bring peace.
... to love your enemy as much as you love yourself?
There's no sin in charity, Jeanne.
Whose were they?
I'm sure he'll forgive you.
Who wants me to stop?
It's like this... I...we...all of them.
Oh, yes. I remember.
You can't, it's too dangerous.
My name's Dorota, I'm Jurek's sister. oh! You're bleeding.
Wladek, please.
I'm sorry - I was given this address. I'm looking for a Mr--  -- a Mr Dzikiewicz.
Just over a year.
How will we sleep?
Where do you want me to go?  Look at me. No, no, I'm not leaving. Can't I take my chances here?
What, I'm working, what?
Oh, you need me now, yes, now you need me!
Who's recruiting?
Oh? More Jewish police? You mean you want me to wear a cap like yours, beat up Jews with my truncheon and catch the Gestapo spirit. I see!
Yes, please.
It certainly was.
Just shut up.
Just one. Dostoevsky. The Idiot. Three zlotys.
You don't know, believe me. They bribe the guards. The guards turn a blind eye. They're bringing in cartloads, food, tobacco, liquor, French cosmetics, and the poor are dying all around them and they don't give a damn.
You're out, aren't you?
Pay him? With what? With what could I pay him? Every zloty I earn we spend on food!
You're amazing, Jehuda.
So, what's the news?
I don't know why I come here every evening, it's always such bad news.
Not this week.
I was listening, Kitten.
Since last night. I was pleased to see you.
It's easy to get out, it's how you survive on the other side that's hard.
Szpilman.  Good name for a pianist.
Watch your feet!
To be deaf?
Yes, like a cave.
No sound at all?
Well, she was very violent with the gown. She tore off a chunk of lace. if hadn't been there I'd have sworn she'd used her teeth
There is something to be said for silence
Baines is packing up?
The Alps.
On your property?
I don't want to learn.
No.
No, no payment. I have given it back. I don't want it.
Spoken words?
What are they?
I'm sorry, I can't do that.  I don't have the time.  Goodbye
Yes and so do I, but there are too few of us here to carry it. TOO - HEAVY
You've missed this bit.
Hah, you're very cunning Ada, but I've seen through you, I'm not going to lose the land this way. Wait here!
Maybe I could help ya if ya told me his name.
What's the line on Visitation?
How bout you?  I'll give you the whole hundred!
Good, have 'em down at Stenner's old Pool Hall before 3:00.  We're gonna run through the route tonight.
All of it.
What?
But you played the Big Con.  You said it was nothin'.  A game for flakes and mama's boys.
Salino?  Why waste our best people on a small-time job like this?  It ain't no heavy gee we're after. The guy's a five and dime grifter.
They didn't think he'd be so cagey, that's all.  They'll get him next time.
He's not comin' in.  Not to get bounced off a job anyway.
You the Duff that didn't come up with his end when Little Jeff was sent up?
I'm busy, Floyd.
What about the other one?
What am I supposed to do?  Call him for cheating better than me?
I don't know.  This is kinda short notice.  I'm not sure we can get it all done by Saturday.
Yeh, Luther said you could teach me something.  I already know how to drink.
He had you down as a big-timer. What happened?
You didn't act much like you wanted to learn it.
No, not a thing.
He threatened to kill me.
Did he hold you up on anything?
He'll show.
Nothin'.  I told ya everything there is.
It was too noisy.
Just a little nervous, that's all.
Fancies himself a gambler, huh?
The wire is ten years outa date.
He wants to put a half million on Syphon.
Everybody'll sit still for somethin'. What did ya find out about the train, Eddie?
Nice work, J.J.
Lonnegan.
Raise 500.
The name is Lonnegan.
You're more gutless than I thought.
You scored blood money today, Hooker.  You need a friend.
I'll square it with the fixer.
Think nothin' of it.
No.
What the hell for?
Well we can't talk in here.  They're having the place painted.
How ya doin', Jimmy.
Naw, just a little hard times, that's all.  It's all over now.
He cheats.
Then why the rat?
You got a system, Carver?
Not yet, but...  Hey, there's only a grand here.
I'll make parole.
If it works again tomorrow, I'll have a half million in cash here by noon the next day.  We split 60-40.
On the nose!  I said place.  Place it on Syphon.  That horse is going to run second.
Sit down and shut up, will ya.  Try not to live up to all my expectations.  We were told you know a hustle artist named Johnny Hooker.
Why don't you pick him up yourself?
Wouldn't that be too bad.  You'd hafta move outa this nice office ya got.
He'll never do it.
Right back to California.  We've got to go home and rest up from our vacation.
It's all right.
Just a minute...
I can't find him.  I've tried everything.  I thought you might know.
Go!
I only know I want to marry you... right now, and --
Dorothy.... listen to me. I love you.  Don't you understand that? I love you.
He's all right.  Isn't that enough?
Shush!
I didn't.
It's a piece of evidence that's worth a great deal more than that.
And I'll give then proof!
He wouldn't say.
Of course we do! We've been friends for years.
No.  The lawyer -- I'm going to see him.
We're at the Normandie for a couple of weeks.  Why don't you drop around?
Yes.
What are you trying to tell me? That you did it?
Oh, yeah?  People fall toward a shot, you know...  not back from it.  I knew you were lying.
Hello, Nick!  And a party - celebrating father's third murder -
You see how much we have to say.
He's all right.
I'm very interested in that body.
I hope you won't talk that way to the police when they come here.
Children, will you go into the next room? I want to talk to Chris alone.
We were looking for this bird.
What's he want of you?
It's a bargain then.  Anything you want to know?
Nunheim!
You see, he'd been very clever. Everybody, even our astute friend Guild, thought that Wynant was alive and that he was the murderer. But our hero had just one weak link in his chain.  The telegrams, wires and telephones were all very well - but no one had seen Wynant. So he picked on poor Mimi here to strengthen his case.  Mimi is the only one at the table who can tell us who the real murderer is.  Mimi, who was it that told you to say you'd seen Wynant?
Yesterday.  I gave her a thousand dollars.
Oh, then you did hear from him?
Why yes.
No.
Looks like he planned, something. He shut up his apartment and his shop.
I guess all the suspects are here.
Maybe if you quit running around after other women you wouldn't have so much trouble with this one.
How'd you like to be thrown in the can on account of not remembering?
You've said that for weeks.
Oh yes.  Why, you told me to sell them a long time ago.
Go ahead!
Yes?
That's all right.
No.
What's all the fuss about? Is he in hiding?
What do you think?
Yes...
That's not for you to decide. Everybody's under suspicion - especially running off like this --  The police will want his description.  Is this a picture of him?
Last night.  He came to see me at my apartment.
You're lying, Mimi.  But then, you'd do anything for money.  You're getting a good price for saying you saw Wynant and you figure you won't get anything if he's dead.
I haven't seen her in three months. We were all washed up.
I wouldn't have any reason to hurt her.  She was always on the up and up with me.  But that dirty little Nunheim -- he got sore cause I clicked with her and he didn't, so he put the finger on me.
I had him out this morning.
Oh, this is Andy --
I was hoping I wouldn't have to tell you.  Dorothy is really my daughter.  You see, it was Spring in Venice, and I was so young.  I didn't know what I was doing.  We were all like that on my father's side.
Much better, thanks.
I haven't the time.  I'm much too busy seeing that you don't lose any of the money I married you for.
That's jolly.
Maybe a drink would help you.
There's nothing I can do to help her.
You'll have to keep them anyway. The man at the Aquarium said that he wouldn't take them back.
All right... shoot!  I mean... what's on your mind?
Well, didn't you?
Who's that?
It's not going to hurt me to get up.
What's the matter with you?
No reason.  Just a hunch.  But I'm going to find out.  I'm tired of being pushed around.
I'm going to take Asta for a walk.
Looks like a hold-up!
He went away lots of times when I knew him - but he never closed his shop. I've got a hunch something is up.
I don't know...  This thing has got my goat. I've got to find out.
You wouldn't be a widow long.
I did find him!
It was his body that was buried there.
That's what they think... Guild and all of them.  They take it for granted that it's just another of Wynant's victims.  Guild's hot-footing it around now, looking for Wynant. That's all that troubles him.
Huh?
Smart gal.
Got a nice evening dress?
Mimi...
His plan was still working beautifully. Wynant was established as being in town.  The watch chain was handed over....  ...with a slight delay...to the police. The only hitch was a man named Nunheim who had found out something.  Our hero paid Nunheim once to keep his mouth shut, and when Nunheim threatened him again, he bumped him off.
That time you sent me up last ... I learned book-keeping at Sing Sing.  I figured it might be an in for me somewhere's.
Mr. Charles - she did - that's why he got sore at her and killed her. Listen, Mr. Charles --  I did do a little chiseling.  I come to bring it back and fix up the books.  I didn't want him to find out and come after me -
I wouldn't know.  That time he caught me was a accident.  I led with my right.
Two weeks work gone for nothing.
I'm thinking about when this war is over. Why you figure I'm here?  'Cause I got tired of being president of GM?  If a brother doesn't play ball, or deal drugs there aren't too many big money prospects around, and I'm not particularly interested in spending the rest of my life fighting the oil companies' wars. So I say if maybe there's something out there, what the hell, that's what I say.
I know you think this is crazy, but a couple of hours from now you're going to be one rich dude trying to buy up every other puzzle box out there.
No, please, not again.
Wha...
We shouldn't have been here, Epps.  There is a war going on!
Low on gas.  Got to refill.
Not much chance of that.  Jaeger's an idiot.
Maybe that's all the Iraqis could afford, okay?  Maybe they got it on discount. Maybe the fuse is messed up.  Or maybe it's going to go off in two seconds, and we won't have to worry about getting Jaeger down off there, all we'll have to worry about is finding the pieces.
The soldiers are going to kill those people!
Probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here.  Worn down to nothing now.
Move!
What am I supposed to do?
I told you.  He tried to steal our gold. He tried to kill us.
We're at war.
And let me guess who is.
Blow me.
There might be.
Just listen to me!  I've been doing some reading.  In the Sixteenth century this region was invaded by the Turks.  It became part of the Ottoman empire.  When the Turks rolled in they raped, they pillaged, the usual stuff.  Anybody who had anything wanted to hide it from these bastards.  They buried their treasures, drew maps, and hid the maps in puzzle boxes.  I read about this, man.  I read about it.
Epps, my leg is falling asleep.
You're not going to let me die, are you!? Don't let me die!
The Shi'ites are on our side?  I didn't know that.
Something like that.
They can't shoot us in here.
So where do we start?
We send the gold up what's to stop him from taking off and leaving us down here?
What's to stop him if he wanted to?  All he has to do is cut the line...
We'll lie.
I'm not like Wes.  Wes was crazy.
Is it all right if I stand up?
You still got a map on you?
We've got to keep moving while there's still light.
Don't you touch it.
I don't know.  Something Wes had taught me.  I think it means "Don't shoot. We're your friends."
They must have thought we were Iraqi when you yelled to them.  They couldn't tell in the dark.
I don't know.  He didn't have a uniform on.  He...he had on white robes, like the guys who killed Wes.
We can't stay here.  Even if that wasn't an Iraqi soldier it's only a matter of time before some show up.  Get all the water you can carry, and we'll head out on foot.
We keep going, that's what we do.  We ignore them, maybe they ignore us.
The...the gold...
A car's got to come along sooner or later.  When it does, we jack it.
Don't make so much out of it.  Only reason I haven't figured a way to get all that money for myself is because I've been too busy figuring ways to stay alive.  Believe me; if I had a minute to catch my breath I might have played things the way you and Wes had.  I'm no better than anybody else.  I've just been busier.
What?
I don't know.
Really?
He'll slow down.
I could use some recon photos too.
The photos.
Okay.
Don't shoot me, I'm friendly.  You can use that when you surrender.
Yeah, you're funny.
For real?  A treasure?
What?
It doesn't mean anything.
The only thing I worry about is how much Iraqi ass I'm going to be able to kick before this whole thing is over.  The only people who I've got anything to worry about are the poor, dumb camel jockeys who don't know enough to get out of the way when I come rolling at them; an M-16 in each hand, and a grenade between my teeth.  Now if you'll excuse me, soldier, I'd like to get back to my box.  I've got a treasure to find.
Yes!
Hell, we'll just buy our way out.
Oh, no.
I don't know.  It would be small, easy to transport and hide.  Gold or jewels. Probably gold.
How the hell should I know how much?
A car is not just a car where I come from.  I had this friend, had this wicked candy apple red Sixty-four and a half Mustang--
You want to say some words?
Cortex bonding....possible temporary.  Before you report a possible equipment malfunction, you check the subjects....?
Violation?
Well it's fixed, so you'll have to eat it.
Look,dirt!
Looks like dirt.
What?...Oh, no, THX.  That's not true.  Not satisfied?  THX, I need you so much.
No!  Don't go.
What?
AH UGH.
No one can see us now we're alone.
No!...No!...
We're leaving.
I wonder how far he went.  He's gathered invaluable information out there.
Incredible!
But you can't...you.
Must be an expressway.... You don't have to stay here, you know....
No?
All right...
I thought of something.....
Thanks.
Off a girl's wrist. A suspect...
What do you mean?
Thanks.
Anything else I should know?
Hey, look--
Oh yeah? Prove it.
Then let's go see what they missed.
Cream of the crop, huh? You?
Sounds like terrorist heaven.
Industrial wood oil. Separately, any one of these things could lead in several directions, but together ...
Where you guys at?
Would you?
You got it.
Nothing.
Too easy. There's gotta be something else in there, another cap maybe.
When in doubt, pull the yellow wire.
No excuses, just do it!
"Punks", huh?
Exactly my thinking. Except, none of the targets can actually be linked to government, political or special interest concerns. They seem to be just unrelated industrial companies. Some insured, some not.
We're a bit busy at the moment, I'll give you a statement in a few minutes if we're still alive.
I was wrong... this didn't come from any cash register.
Meg's lasagna. Good eats, Reilly. C'mon.
We've created a monster.
Taylor's dead.
Thank you.
People are dying.
Security.
Stay here.
Stay in the truck.
I'm sorry, detective, but you're just not my type.
Lab's backed up, we're still waiting for it.
Son-of-a-bitch... my nose... This fuck-up is interfering with-
Time for bed, kiddos. Say goodnight.
I gotta get back on top. Get off the sleaze detail.
Hell, I got a gold watch... it just don't work. Maybe they'll give me a new fishing pole, or something useful.
Nah, let's just take a look-see.
Don't talk.
Quiet!
It's about this.
Huh?
My first undercover assignment. I gotta look good, right?
It won't work, he'll know it's a trap...
Fire me later. Close in and we got the bastard.
And it had diamonds in the back.
Diamonds all over.
In a moment.
Yes, M'sieu Laval?
erect in sweater, arms folded.
I said, "Come in." And there he was. A fine-looking man with a moustache and long sideburns. He said, "Good evening. I'm the doctor." I said, "Doctor?" He said, "Yes, the doctor. I came to see about your tonsils."
No ...  Have <u>you</u> ever been in Vienna?
But you <u>have</u> been in Venice?
Let me tell you, Venice <u>can't</u> <u>compare</u> with Constantinople.
I don't care <u>what</u> you say! In Constantinople at least you have streets, sultans, pashas--
Good morning.  I'd-I'd-I'd like to look at some cuff links.
Umm.
Nice suit.
Funny--the first time I saw him I thought he was a doctor!
Yes, Baron?
For more than forty years. So Madame told me.
Um-hum!
Nervous! Why should I be nervous?
And you will be out by tomorrow morning.
M'sieu Monescu!
Just as you say, Doctor.
Good day, Doctor.
The tennis player. He saw me. He bowed. What could I do? I nodded.  Baron, I shouldn't have come!
I would like to.
No--proud. Very proud!
Not at all, Countess ... There's one very good stone in it.
You remember the man who walked into the Bank of Constantinople and walked out <u>with</u> the Bank of Constantinople?
And take the twenty thousand francs ...
And tomorrow is the fifteenth. And the day after tomorrow--
Certainly!
Oh, no, darling. There's <u>more</u> sex appeal coming on the first of the month.  It's only ten days ...  Eight hundred and fifty thousand francs.
Yes!  Now don't worry!
Spanish passports?
<u>Am</u> <u>Berliner</u> <u>Zug</u>.
What time is your rendezvous?
Lily!
Yes.
Not particularly.
Well--I am Madame Colet.
The pleasure is mine, madame.
Too much blue in crimson.
No, no, no!  I disagree with you completely! I tried it once--
No. What is it? Tell me.
This used to be my secretary's room.
That sounds sensible.
Will you be good enough to run through these papers with M'sieu Giron?
Together.
How do you like my dress?
Hair?
I know all your tricks.
So you think you can get me?
I know it.
On the night table.
Please!
No--thirty-five!
Call the police?
Yes, madame!
He is my secretary! I hope that answers all your questions, M'sieu Giron.
Yes, madame. You see, I have to get up very early.  My little brother goes to school--  You see, Mother is dead.
Please!  Thank you.
You see--  Oh, not a word to M'sieu Laval!
That's right.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
Take the elevator to the very bottom, go left, down the crewman's passage, then make a right.
You know, boss, this happened to Geraldo and his career never recovered.
We're running out of time. And this strutting martinet...  ...isn't letting any men in at all.
Then that's our play. But we're still going to need some insurance.  Come on.
There's no need for language, Mr. Hockley.  Go back and turn the heater on in my room, so it won't be too cold when we get back.
It was... stupid really. I was leaning over and I slipped.
Rose is displeased. Mmm... what to do?
Of course not. That's not the point.  Goodbye! Goodbye!! I'll miss you!
I don't know what she's say, she don't know what I say, so we get along fine.
We got room for lots more. I say we go back.
I prefer not to push the engines until they've been properly run in.
It would hurt. I'm not saying it wouldn't. To be honest I'm a lot more concerned about the water being so cold.
Freezing. Maybe a couple degrees over.
Could I speak to you in private?
Is he your boyfriend?
Yes, exactly!
If only it were that simple.
Oh, Jack... please don't judge me until you've seen my world.
Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
They didn't teach you that in finishing school? Here, it's easy. Watch closely.
Time for my coach to turn back into a pumpkin.
You're still my best girl, Cora.
A mistake?
Sssshh. Come here.
To the stars.
Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right?
I'm so cold.
Yes, like a mill pond. Not a breath of wind.
Mmmmm. Well, I'm off. Maintain speed and heading, Mr. Lightoller.
If your grandma is who she says she is, she was wearing the diamond the day Titanic sank.  And that makes you my new best friend. I will happily compensate you for anything you can tell us that will lead to its recovery.
It was a dreadful, heavy thing.  I only wore it this once.
Goodbye, mother.
Any woman's crazy to feel about a man the way I do about you.
Sure!
I'll join you later.
I can explain--
I'm just commencing to enjoy this trip.
Glad to see you again.
That's a date.
Yes--and <U>very</U> popular--
Where's Lother?
Lifted it out of a guy's cabin last night.
Stick-up. Needed dough to get ashore.
And me coming in with two pair--
Fine--I'll be glad to.
Want to take it back?
Very much--
No! Don't touch it! I want the <U>world</U> to see my <U>shame</U>.
Nothing to speak of. What is this--third degree?
What a horrible death! Do you know what you remind me of?
Anything I can do?  I'd jump overboard if it'd help you.
A lot of things I'd like to forget.
Lonesome?
Yes--you know what I've been thinking, Sally?--
I'll give you plenty of rings as soon as I get the stones set--what do you think?
I'm beginning to think you're a pretty swell guy.
We didn't have enough dough for two tickets, did we?
No bank roll there, boy.  Lucky I could get you signed on--they picked up that Pittsburgh jeweler--made him talk. The heat's on, Shortie--and those Atlantic breezes are going to be mighty welcome.
I'll watch for him, sir.
Oh, no--You're not gonna give my hard-earned money away.
Stop squawking! You were doing this job on a ship four years ago when I first picked you up, weren't you?
Why <U>didn't</U> I think of that?--I am going to scout around and see if I can find her.
Are you screwy?
Well, if that's the case, you're sure of winning the first couple of hands--But what about after that?
What is it?
Oh, is she? What a shame!  You'll pardon me?
Listen, Runt--Quick! Where's the ice?
It's a pleasure.
Much better--thank you--
Why, you wouldn't quit when you're ahead, would you?
Some of the smartest robberies have taken place aboard ships--
Sorry--but I'm on a vacation--
I wouldn't be surprised--
No, thanks--I'll take a walk around the deck and then turn in--
Nervous. Couldn't sleep. Feel like a nightcap?
Why?
Anybody that's taken the trouble to get it would be a mug to put it back.
Tell you what I'll do.  I'll toss you for her--heads she plays with me.
I'm O.K. It didn't hurt much.
No--I'm looking for Miss Marsh myself. I thought you might know where she is--
That's right--here's the eighty cents for you. I'd rather see you get it than the company--send it right off.
Back is in New York.
O.K.! Send that!
Not the <U>real</U> Chad Denby?--
Well, did you find me?
She's in New York.
That's right--you're the one I was looking for.  You'll excuse me.   How about you and I being alone?
Looks to me like standard equipment for the Department of Street Cleaning--
Is this your gun?
Like it?
No--not much--excepting--
What's the difference? He's got more heads than he needs.
Very serious?
Of course--but--  There's your cue--hurry up--
What do you mean?
Meaning what?
So what?
Oh, all right--  See you later, Toots.
No--but I'm going to keep my eye on--
Well, I helped my hand so I'll have to see you.
Don't kid yourself--you know how I stand back there.
Of course not--  --but isn't it a coincidence that he's from the eighteenth precinct--where they made the squawk?
Just smile again and be reasonable.  I'll order dinner here--just the two of us--like old times.
Not a chance--I'm through.
I sincerely hope so--
It all depends on what you're used to.
Then why did you run away?
Ed Bailey, you look like you're Just ready to burst.  Well call me A fool but I guess I'll just have To call.  Cover your ears, darling.
Now Ed, are we cross?
Gave all that up.  Going into business.
Maybe even my destiny.
Well I'm not so go home.
They were all gonna jump me back There.  What ever happened to one Against one?
This brand.
I know.  Just did what you had to. That banner and stuff, that's Just Ike.  Don't worry about it.
No...
Excuse me?
Yeah, you look it.
Yes, but there's just something About him.  Something around The eyes, I don't know, reminds me Of... me.  No.  I'm sure of it, I Hate him.
I'm a good woman to you, Doc. Don't I always take care of you? Nobody cares for you like me.  I'm A good woman.
Didn't you always say gambling's An honest trade?
Depends how you look at it.  I Mean it's not like anybody's Holding a gun to their heads.
But who was the Devil?
Ignore her?
I stand corrected.  Wyatt.  You're An oak.
But Doc-
No...
Don't touch me, God damn it!  Just Don't touch me!  Come on...
How you feelin', Doc?
All right, Doc...
All I ever wanted was to live a Normal life.
All right.  Then what?
You know, Frederic-fucking-Chopin.
There's no reasoning with him.
Good God, you're really-
Yeah.  Or undertakers.
Not so sure.  Somethin' tells me It gets harder from here in.  Should've held out for more money.
It rides right at 'em.  Like McMasters said, see it through to The end.
How would you know?
The way you talk.  Never heard a Woman talk like that.
I can't, I'm sorry.  Forgive me.
Wait!
Mattie, they're here!  Folks this Is Celia Ann but you can call her Mattie.  Or even Mrs.  Earp if you Prefer.
No really, I can stay a while.
I know what I'm doing.  Where have You been?
No?  Brothers to the bone, right?
Drop his horse.
Hey!  Virgil!  My God!  Morgan!  Hey, Boy!  You look great!  Both of you!
Lotta law around here.  Just met the Sheriff.
Come on, we're not about pickin' Fights.  Just gonna keep a little Order, that's all.
I know, kid.  I know.  Me too.
I know, I was wrong.  But Morg, Look, we got to get out.
You're on.
Yeah.  It's a fact.
500... Year's wages.  And I never even saw a horse like that.
Doc's just in no kinda shape.
I know, I need a keeper.
Wait a minute, you thinkin' of Getting in bed with the Cowboys?
No, damn it, it's wrong, they're Breakin' the law.
Ah, now that's the real mother- Lode in Tombstone.  Up and down Allen Street, full-blast 24 hours A day, liquor, hostesses, Gamblin', makin' money hand over Fist.  All except the Oriental.  On Account of the element.  Have a Man for breakfast in there most Days.  Regular slaughter house. High-rollers won't go near it. Too bad, nice place.
Curly Bill, huh?  Who was that Other idiot?
Yeah, and dangerous.
- I'll be sure to acknowledge 007's 'assistance' in my report to the Prime Minister. But this is, still, a naval operation.
36 hours. They've already sailed from the Persian gulf.
Sir Elliot.
...Words to live by?
Sidney, perhaps we should leave this to -
Chernobyl will look like a campfire.
I'm sorry.
- We all want what we can't have?
No, 007. It's just that I've learned from personal experience - that when we get what we want -  Somehow the reality is never as... Satisfying as the fantasy.
Guard! Arrest these men! Escort them to the cutter!
I've got half the British government breathing down my neck. I don't have time for your nonsense.
Shhhhh...
He didn't want anyone to know. He kept it out of the papers. He said a third wife was bad for his image.  You've got to protect me!
Political considerations?
Q's retirement party. I'd just put the knife into the cake, and -
Fishing?
Plastique explosive shoelaces.  Cut them to regulate the size of the blast; totally harmless until you attach the detonator hidden in the heel of your shoe.
Something with an engine? Not oars?
Not if you kill us first - unless that's how you plan to leave Muffy.
I'm not certain... But I think there's someone I want to press for some answers in Kuala Lumpur.
Interesting video tape.
Three. You? Married?
Chaperone. I'm waiting for my dinner date.
Let's not make it a habit.
Think about mom.
- The family jewels?
Thank you.  "Now hear this: Drop dead."
He was my father's best friend!
You are seriously deranged.
Up.
Don't say it.
First, that boat is in international waters. I'm claiming it for salvage. One-third of that gold is mine.
Now.
'Able to topple governments with a single story' - as he says in his press.
Of course.
... Didn't we once investigate Harmsway?
I understand.
Stop it!
Fifteen seconds. Perhaps you should consider hiring an attorney.
Pencil it in for the next trip -
No -
Check it again. What about the global positioning satellite? Could there be something wrong with the signal?
Seems to be back to normal, sir.
Entering the main tunnel - ten minutes to target -
...Haven't we already paid him for his services?
I don't know. He's not in the database -
You all don't believe me when I tell you I'm afraid of heights.
You always got something to say.
Why are you always afraid to get somewhere?
This is what it is all about, trying to keep from being out on the street.
I told her I would if she would give me time.
You dumb ass, it's Babe Brother.
Pops put Big Daddy's farm in Rhonda's and Sunny's name and fixed it so no one can borrow on it.
Why in the h...
Do you think you won?
And what lesson have we learned from all of this, Babe Br... Sam... I mean Samuel?
Well, you look better than you did yesterday.
Have you lost your mind? Have you thought about your wife and child, not to mention your sick father? And I need your help to move his bed from under the leak in the ceiling.
Boy, that is the real South. That is real corn liquor.
This would be a bad time for me to leave.
I always had chickens, ducks and whatnots.
We grow most of our own food. The money I get from social security, my pension and my wife's work, keeps us living on the edge. What choice do people like us have.
Everyone is gone. Rhonda is in the bathroom.
Look! Don't try to get ahead by riding our backs.
Babe Brother is a poor boy.
I don't want to hear any tales about colored people...
That's awful generous of you. I always ask to keep from wearing out welcome.
I'm going to wash up now. You all please excuse me.
I was going to get up and get a hen out there for dinner, but time got away.
It was slow. Now it seems like everyone is having births at home.
You still call him boy. You call Babe Brother boy in front of his wife and son.
It hasn't been the years; it's been the men in her life.
I tell you, I feel like a ghost.
Where we come from, you had to know how to act right. You had to know how to say yes sir and no sir. You had to know your place.
Good afternoon to you.
Hattie is a different person now.
Only if you are a good man, a friend. Are you a friend?
Now who are we talking about?
That is a boy from home, Lulla's brother.
Well some folks are still waiting for their comeuppance. Don't take me wrong but you can't judge people by how you act. You're a caring person.
Oh, I'm more modern in my ways. I don't believe in sin, though there is good and evil.  And evil is a thing you work at.
I haven't heard anyone mention Swamp Root since button-up shoes went out.
He's just raffish. Harry put him up to it. Before evening sun sets, I would have his belongings back on Route 55, that old fox.
Everybody who have been associated with Harry end up with pennies over their eyes.
Why not? Harry says that's the only way to do good.
Tolerably well. I brought you some more rabbit manure for your roses.
Well, sure, we can leave it up.
But Mom, I can't find him!
Sure!  I'll even let you drive.
Oh, great, you found them.  Where were they?
See?  Now, what did I tell you? Right where you left them.
Well sure, look at him.  He's got more gadgets on him then a Swiss army knife.
Mm-hmmmmm.
What are you talking about?  Where's that bonding strip?!
WHAT?!!  What are you talking about?!
You mean it has hyperdrive?
YOU are the one that decided to climb into this --
Hey!!  Hey!  How are you doing that? Stop that!
Sorry guys, but dinner's canceled!
Sh-h-h-h-h!!  Quiet, Buzz.
Did I get my package in the mail?
I'll have to perform one of my...operations!
And I'm from Mattel.  Well, I'm not actually  from Mattel, I'm actually from a smaller company that was purchased in a leveraged buy-out. Well, I don't really understand the financials, but...
All right, that's enough.  Look, we're all very impressed with Andy's new toy --
Come on.  Let's get out of here.
Toss 'im overboard!
I was close to being scared that time.
But what if Andy gets another dinosaur?  A mean one?  I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection.
Hey, Woody!?  Where'd ya go?
Hey look!  It's Buzz!
Sir!  No Sir!
Yes SIR!
This is it!  This is it!  Quiet, quiet, quiet!
Juvenile intrusion!  Repeat! Resume your positions NOW!
No, Slink --
Excuse me.
Do you know you've lovely hair, even if you torment it in those braids.
It's as though he'd trapped a real cuckoo inside.
Is that all?
Go away.
You're not so old yourself!
Can you move over a wee bit?
I know for a fact he didn't take Jonathon. Jonathon went off by himself.
You're late for breakfast.
Is she in any kind of therapy... professional help?
Arnie, this is crazy.
Arnie, I feel like Alice stepping through the looking glass.
Please.  Tell me who Carl sells to.
What about legitimate businesses? We own a construction concern, real estate --
That is going to be rather difficult when all the evidence is against us.
Carl, I'm running late.  I'm coming right now --
I was just waiting for the right time.
Carl, think about it, if I was trying to rip you off, I would have left town after Ruiz was killed.  I wouldn't sit next to you in court listening to the dismissal.
That's frustrating.
Me, too.
Yeah, well, she has a way of self- medicating that probably seems familiar, too.
Not yet.
What do you think?
Fuck you.  I wasn't doing anything. You're like the Gestapo.
Yes.
We live our lives by these unspoken rules that are handed to us.
He's gonna fucking die right here on the kitchen floor --
Then here's a little bump.
I think so.  If she didn't she should have.  I've only got maybe an hour.  Then volleyball practice is over and I have to be home.
Nope.
We got you on tape making the deal. We got you bragging about the quality. We got you bragging about your business.  We got you.
I love my job.  I love it.  The next time I'm having a bad day you gotta remind me of right now and I'll get over it.
You can learn a lot about somebody from this stuff.  Three categories: you like me, you hate me, you want something from me.  Definitely third category.
No --
Not Tiger Woods.
There's always a way.  If people get to the Pope or the President, you can get to him.
No, this is not possible.  And I thank you for coming down here, though I suspect it's been a pointless journey.
I hear these stories.  Your husband in jail.  His business in chaos. Various people fighting over the scraps.
You want to smuggle narcotics in Mr. Espastico Jacobo.  That's nothing new.
I don't know.  Something.
She's nosy.  She hears me on the telephone.
What?
Where?
I feel like a traitor.
Javier Rodriguez.
An informant.
I'm aware of that.
I can't believe you used to bring my daughter here, to this place.
I'm sorry... Did I wake you?
What?  I thought Madrigal was dead. I thought it was verified.
The cards. The last thing I said to you was mind the cards.
If everyone keeps their mouth shut, there'll be no one going to jail.
You've stabbed me, man.
Let's face it, it could have been wonderful.
Did you bring the cards?
I'd fucking kill you.
think I left something back at the -
Are you clean?
Too young for what?
Sixteen next month.
What, and deny myself the only pleasure I get from him? Did I tell you about my birthday?
Exactly. I'm not wanting a cat, she says. Get to fuck, right. So there's Tommy stuck with this kitten. You can imagine what happened. The thing was neglected, pissing and shitting all over the place. Tommy was lying around fucked out of his eyeballs on smack or downers. He didn't know you could get toxoplasmosis from cat shit.
Of course, the motto, the motto --
No.
No, I'm clean.
Yeah.
And you might get the fucking job.
Right. So we all get old and then we can't hack it any more. Is that it?
Give me the gun.
Clear enough, Moneypenny. This should present no significant problem.
Stick it on my tab.
In that case --
The strategy is this: get clean, get mobile, get into dealing, and this time next year I'll be watching the rising sun with a posse of oriental buttocks parked on my coupon.
Such as?
Are you serious?
It's really nice, Tommy. Can we go home now?
What?
No. Well, yes. I have to admit it: I'm a perfectionist. For me, it's the best or nothing at all. If things go badly, I can't be bothered, but I have a good feeling about this interview. Seems to me like it's gone pretty well. We've touched on a lot of subjects, a lot of things to think about, for all of us.
It is I.  The journey you undertook to reach me could not have been an easy one.
All right, we're lost.  But we're making good time.
Plotting our new course.
Estimating destination in 6.7 hours, present speed.
I don't have a clue.
Your threats amuse me, Captain Chekov. What consequences did you have in mind?
Then it's fortunate that I have you and your starship to protect me. In the meantime, Captain Chekov, I instruct you and your First Officer to beam down to my coordinates.
I instruct you to surrender. You are under attack by Federation forces.
What do you know of my pain?
The power was within you.
Go, Sulu.
I believe Dr McCoy is not in the best of moods.
That's great. I haven't sung around a campfire since I was a boy in Iowa. What are we going to sing? What... Bones, what are we going to sing?
He reminds me of someone I knew in my youth.
We don't have 1.2 hours.
Yes, Captain?
Yes, Captain.
Worse. I have betrayed you. I do not expect you to forgive me.
If I had pulled the trigger, Sybok would be dead.
He's sorry, See, he's sorry. Everything... that makes everything all right. He's sorry, everything's...
This is a new brig, Captain. It is escape-proof.
The designers tested it using the most intelligent and resourceful person they could find. He failed to escape.
That's a little vague, Spock -
If I activate them now, Captain, we will be propelled upward at an unbelievable rate.
Welcome aboard, Captain.
I've done nothing. This is who they are. Didn't you know that?
Because you, too, must know.
Uhura, I thought you were on leave.
I still don't get why you're trying to break into the system.
Uh... got any cinnamon?
Yeah...pain in the neck, you know, I was all set
To warn him.
Uh, no ... I mean, not that often -
Well, you have to expect some static. Computers are just machines after all, they can't think...
We have to close that down, just briefly. Security reasons.  Someone with that access has been tampering.
For sure...
Yes, okay, exactement!
No, nuh-uh, never in a million years!
So... Nice ship you got here. What's our next move?
There's a 68.71 percent chance you're right.
I'm sorry -
The MCP is the most efficient way of handling what we do. I can't sit and worry about every little user request that --
Doing our business is what computers are for. Look, Walter, with all respect -- ICOM isn't the business you started in your garage anymore --
When you've been in the system as long as I have, you hear many promises... many reassurances...many brave plans...
The name of my User, yeah. But how... ?
You know anybody that's got an army for rent, that's fine...but my, uh, User said to go take that sucker out. An' let's face it, the big ox isn't gonna get any weaker. I feel like hittin' him now, while I'm good an' mad. Some nerve... what does he care whether you guys get killed, long as he keeps rakin' in quarters?
Tanks...coming back. Let's go.
Look, you guys know how it is. You just keep doin' what it looks like you're supposed to, even if it seems crazy, and you hope to hell your User knows what's goin' on.
Probably decided not to pursue us, The Sea of Simulation is tricky.. lot of illusions...rough navigating. Programs have a way of just... disappearing here.
Not with this disk. I'm going to check on the beam connection, Yori. You two can keep a watch out for grid bugs.
Lousy utility companies ... they're the same wherever you go.
Shhhhh.
Oh, I was an actuarial program... worked at a big insurance company. It really gives you a great feeling, helping folks plan for their future needs -- and of course, if you look at the payments as an annuity, over the years, the cost is really
Yeah, but I'm remembering all kinds of stuff. Like...my User wants me to go after the MCP
You're getting out of the business?
You rather take your chances with me? Want me to slow down your power cycles for you?
End of line.
Another free program off line.  What's his User s'posed to do -- ?
That's all going to change, Yori...
I had to...in the games...
Then I owe you some thanks...
It's something Users do.
Where are you going?
It's Talkradio.  You're on the air.
Yep.  Sleep fast.
Don't be ridiculous.  She's only -- how old is she?
Will you just open the door!					*
Yeah, right.
Uh huh.  Want me to lose them?
Son of a bitch!
I'll just hang then, shall I?
It can't be.
The purse is still at the house.
In her Walkman.  It's the one thing I knew she'd be taking.
Let's go.  I'll brief you in the air.
I wasn't cheating!
I'd like that.
It's certainly... dramatic.
Is that why you got into this business?
Yes what?
Juno.  I wish I could say it's a pleasure to see you again.
I slept with him and he knocked off a hundred bucks.
No.
Harry?  What can I say about Harry?  He's a sales rep for a computer company.
Answer the question--
Do you still love your husband?
You wouldn't believe me.
I don't know what this crazy bitch is on.  You should just cut her loose, so we can get down to business.
Don't call me honey!  You don't ever get to call me honey again. You understand?!  You pig!
Sodium amytal, maybe some other truth agent.
Yup.										*
Are you a total lying, scumsucking pig Harry?
What?
I told the guy---  I told the guy, this isn't even my order.
So you're basically lying your ass off the whole time?  I couldn't do it.
Those idiots.
Red hot.  Her thighs steam.
I'm Helen Tasker.  Harry's my husband.  And you are?
I understand.
Cairo was a day at the beach next				* to this.
What is it you need me to do?
Wait a minute -
You can't have just one.
Well, fuck that shit, we'll get some real food. What would taste good.  What do you think would taste good?
Clarence says we gotta be hittin' it.
Ya looked through it?
Now hang up.
I took a cab.
Well, it's just when I see a really good movie I really like to go out and get some pie, and talk about it. It's sort of tradition. Do you like to eat pie after you've seen a good movie?
Would you like to get some pie?
There's nothing to tell.
Yeah, I got the key, so I come here at night, hang out, read comic books, play music.
That's a "Rookies" doll. George Sanford Brown. We gotta lotta dolls. They're real cool. Did you know they came out with dolls for all the actors in "The Black Hole"? I always found it funny somewhere there's a kid playin' with a little figure of Earnest Borgnine.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
At the bus station. He said I'd be a perfect call girl. And that he knew an agency in California that, on his recommendation, would handle me. They have a very exclusive clientele: movie stars, big businessmen, total white-collar. And all the girls in the agency get a grand a night. At least five hundred. They drive Porsches, live in condos, have stockbrokers, carry beepers, you know, like Nancy Allen in "Dressed to Kill". And when I was ready he'd call 'em, give me a plane ticket, and send me on my way. He says he makes a nice finder's fee for finding them hot prospects. But no one's gonna pay a grand a night for a girl who doesn't know whether to shit or wind her watch. So what I'm doin' for Drexl now is just sorta learnin' the ropes. It seemed like a lotta fun, but I don't really like it much, till last night. You were only my third trick, but you didn't feel like a trick. Since it was a secret, I just pretended I was on a date. An, um, I guess I want a second date.
You will?
I don't believe so.
Bottom of the ninth . Mr. Worley. Oh, by the by, Mr. Worley, have you seen your lovely wife today?
Why?
What?
Babalouey, you were perfect, I could hardly keep from busting up.
You were chillin', kind of creepy even. You totally fucked with his head. I'm gonna go grab dinner.
What?
Cancoon.
Floyd say he don't be eatin' pussy.
I was dying. I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face.
That's why it doesn't come across as ass-kissin', because it's genuine, and he can see that.
Has he gotten his mail today?
Well, she's a pretty amazing girl. What are women like out here?
Did you meet Captain Kirk?
Yeah, they do. And maybe when I start being a successful actor I'll know those guys. But most of the people I know are like me. They ain't got a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of. Now, if you want to sell a little bit at a time -
Elliot Blitzer.
Where?
In case.
You wanna take me to a kung fu movie?
Want an animal cracker?
The police department?
Riddle me this, Batman. If you're all so much in love with each other, what the fuck are you doing here? I'm sure you got better things to do with your time than walk around in circles starin' up a panther's ass. Your guy's interested because with that much shit at his fingertips he can play Joe fuckin' Hollywood till the wheels come off. He can sell it, he can snort it, he can play Santa Claus with it. At the price he's payin', he'll be everybody's best friend. And, you know, that's what we're talkin' about here. I'm not puttin' him down. Hey, let him run wild. Have a ball, it's his money. But, don't expect me to hang around forever waitin' for you guys to grow some guts.
I guess so. Follow me.
No. No you're not.
You know, I saw it on the stands, my first inclination was to buy it. But, I look at the price and say forget it, it's just gonna be the same old shit. I ended up breaking down and buying it a few days later. Man, I was ever wrong.
The biggest. The biggest movie you've ever dealt with, Lee. We're talkin' a lot of film. A man'd have ta be an idiot not to be a little cautious about a movie like that. And Lee, you're no idiot.
I don't think that'll be necessary. Let's all have a seat. Boris, why don't you be nice and get coffee for everybody.
I'm not satisfied till the spoon stands straight up.
A Norms in Van Nuys.
I bullshitted him.
That's about all I ever eat.
You don't know the chicken places around where you live?  Ask the guy at the place where a chicken place is.
Could you find out if they know anythin'? I don't know they know shit about us. But I don't wanna think, I wanna know. You could find out for sure what's goin' on.  Daddy?
You were a cop.
Look, goddamnit, I never asked you for a goddamn thing! I've tried to make your parental obligation as easy as possible. After Mom divorced you, did I ask you for anything? When I wouldn't see ya for six months to a year at a time, did you ever get your shit about it? No, it was always "OK", "No problem", "You're a busy guy, I understand". The whole time you were a drunk, did I ever point my finger at you and talk shit? No! Everybody else did. I never did. You see, I know that you're just a bad parent. You're not really very good at it. But I know you love me. I'm basically a pretty resourceful guy. If I didn't really need it I wouldn't ask. And if you say no, don't worry about it. I'm gone. No problems.
No shit?
Who is he?
It's a fact. Sicilians have nigger blood pumpin' through their hearts. If you don't believe me, look it up. You see, hundreds and hundreds of years ago the Moors conquered Sicily. And Moors are niggers. Way back then, Sicilians were like the wops in northern Italy. Blond hair, blue eyes. But, once the Moors moved in there, they changed the whole country. They did so much fuckin' with the Sicilian women, they changed the blood-line for ever, from blond hair and blue eyes to black hair and dark skin. I find it absolutely amazing to think that to this day, hundreds of years later, Sicilians still carry that nigger gene. I'm just quotin' history. It's a fact. It's written. Your ancestors were niggers. Your great, great, great, great, great-grandmother was fucked by a nigger, and had a half-nigger kid. That is a fact. Now tell me, am I lyin'?
Thank you.
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
Uh-huh.
Sure was.
Nicholson and I go to work on him. Now er know somthing's rotten in Denmark, 'cause this dickhead had a big bag, and it's uncut, too, so we're sweatin' him, trying to find out where he got it. Scarin' the shit outta him.
To front for him. So Elliot is workin' out the deal between them and his boss, a big movie producer named Lee Donowitz.
This guy's gonna kill him.
Naw, man, it ain't white boy day.
Look here. If I ever did eat some pussy - I would never eat any pussy - but, if I did eat some pussy, I sure as hell wouldn't tell no goddamn body. I'd be ashamed as a motherfucker.
No way, JosÈ.
Read my lips.
Are you Dick Ritchie?
Do you know a Clarence Worley?
I didn't mean -
Uh, I didn't hear the...
You don't want to jeopardize that reduction, do you, Cole?  Have it taken away?
What are you going to do with us?
Hey, no problem, it's probably just another kidnapping featuring Jeffrey's shrink, pardon me, make that ex-shrink.  This is your leader, a certifiable lunatic who told his former psychiatrist all his plans for God knows what whacko irresponsible schemes, and now who knows what she's painted out there on our wall?
It was released in Philadelphia, probably on June 14, 1995.
I need to go now.
No, not possible.  Listen, I have to get out of here.  I'm supposed to be getting information.
Because I'm a good observer.  Because I have a tough mind.
No.
You wouldn't understand.
It's so clean.  No germs.
I have to go.
July?!
1989.  Six years for you.  There's the sign!  Right here!
You told me you'd help me.  I know this isn't what you meant, but...I was desperate... no money...bum leg... sleeping on the streets. I probably smell bad.  Sorry about that. But then I saw your book in a store window with a notice about your lecture.  I can read, remember?
"If something really happens"...like what, James?
And I was in it?  What did I do?
It wasn't me before, James.  It's become me now because of...what's happening.  Please untie me.
Jeffrey Mason?
First, it's important that you surrender to them instead of them catching you running.  Okay?
No, I want to turn myself in.  Where is he?  Don't worry -- it's all okay now.  I'm not crazy any more!  I mean, I am crazy, mentally divergent, actually, but I know it now and I want you to help me.  I want to get well...
James...do you remember...six years ago...you had a phone number!  You tried to call and...
They got your message, Kathryn.  They played it for me.  It was a bad recording...distorted.  I didn't recognize your voice.
Well, you look pretty different, too.
On the walls -- they meant the animals when they said, "We did it."
I was here...as a kid.  I think you were here, too.  But you...looked just like you look now.
Right!  You're right.  I have to fix this.
Scientists.  I'm supposed to report in to them.  They'll want to know they sent me to the wrong time.
No, no.  I can't talk to them.  It's called, "voice mail".  I'm supposed to leave messages. They monitor it from the present.
It's private.
Not, "what", babe!  When!
I just need to have access to the pure virus, that's all!  For the future!
How did you find me?
Hey, man...
They gave you a pardon, man.  Whatdaya want?
Well, the guard woke me up.  He told me I volunteered.
And what we believe is what's accepted as "truth" now, isn't it, Owen?  Psychiatry -- it's the latest religion.  And we're the priests -- we decide what's right and what's wrong --we decide who's crazy and who isn't. ... I'm in trouble, Owen.  I'm losing my faith.
Your psychiatrist?  Did you just say, "your psychiatrist"?
All right, old man.  Christ.
Christ!
I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
I'm a little short. I'll catch you next time.
Ain't over yet.  Night is part of day; separate, but equal.  Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.
Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark.  People are afraid of what they can't see.  I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me. Kiss from a beautiful woman, a lick from a dog.  The kiss of death. It's all the same.
More or less.
Never heard of it.  It's got no day or date.  Hell, it ain't even got numbers.  What's the matter?  You couldn't afford a Timex?
Will be.
I don't care, just get me there.
The ticket is thirty dollars.
Harlin around?
Yep.
I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
Okay, I'm stuck.  You happy?  Now can you fix it, or not?
I don't have a credit card.  They took my wallet.
You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.
I'm taking my car, and I'm taking it now!
It is morning.
Honest like Al Capone on tax day. Where are my keys?
Let me have a Beck's.
Yeah, I'll try.
I think I burned my gun hand!
He killed him, Sheriff!  I couldn't stop him!  He made me come with him. He told me if I said a word he would kill me too.
What do you want?
Don't tell him anything.  He can't do this.
John--
Wrong number.
I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you. Remember?
I picked them out for you, Jake.  I thought you would like the colors.
Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.
No trouble at all, really.
Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
I guess I've got wander in my blood.
Thank you.
What?
You know what I want.
If he says that's what happened, Jake, it must be true.
Depends on what you call love.  When I was growing up I had nothing.  I learned to want everything.  I wanted more than Sierra anyway. Jake was my ticket.  He's not much; he's older than me, different than me, but he's got more money than half this town put together.  I courted him.  I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line.  I wanted him.  I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him.  Is that love?
Yeah.
Grace, I can't.  I can't even get out of here myself.  I need a hundred-fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic.
Where?
You live pretty good.
How much money has he got?
If the key's on him, to get the key we'd have to . . .
It's not like he's a young man. He's had time to live.
The only reason I stormed off is because you sort of spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it. It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here. But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.
I don't know.
I'm not sure where it is.  Not exactly.  I never saw it.  I just heard him talk about it.
This is good.  This is real good. This is so good they might not even charge us with murder when they catch us.  They'll probably just lock us up for being idiots.
Damn you!  What did you do that for? He can't prove anything.
Not me.  Us.
He can kill us.  I don't know about you, but my life is worth thirty- thousand dollars.
You're tense.  What are you all uptight about?
I don't want to go to Mexico, John. I want to be with you.  Don't you think I care about you?
I'm here.
Where the hell am I going to go?
Yeah, they'll find you.  Dried up and twice dead.
At least I'll have company when I die.  Ain't that right, Jake?
A lot that means.
Is this what it's all about?  You sucker me up here so you can watch the two of us beat the shit out of each other over you?  Forget it.  You want to take my head off, Mister, I won't even try to stop you.  I deserve it for being an idiot.  But if you're not, I think I'll be on my way.
Jake McKenna.  That's a solid name.
My car overheated.  I pulled in to have it fixed.
That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy you that.  Beside, I can hardly blame you.  That Grace has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she? Eh?
Because I'm sick and tired of her little games.  Because you could do it and drift away on your boat and no one would ever see you again. Because I've got a fifty-thousand dollar life insurance policy on her, and I would be more than happy to give the man who does her in a good chunk of it.
No.
How do you put a price on murder?
You're not buying a car, for Christ sake.  You're having your wife killed.  I'm the one who's neck is stuck out.  It's thirteen, or it's nothing.
Do we shake hands?
How the hell should I know?  I've never had a wife killed before.  I guess I should have hired a professional.
Be quiet, boy.  I'm thinking.  It can't be done at the house.  It should be . . .
Is the job done?
You didn't kill her?
Maybe you heard old Jake's got some money stashed away and you thought you'd help yourself to a little.
You thought you'd come in here in the middle of the night and wham! Wail off and clock old Jake McKenna and turn his brains into wall paper.
There's another reason?  It better be good.
You came to take my wife from me?
Come on, Jake--
You're not talking sense.
What difference does it make if I slept with her.  You don't care about Grace.
It's not me you have to worry about. It's her.  She wants you dead, Jake. She wants you dead and she wants your money.
You know what kind of woman Grace is.  You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Sierra.  What makes you think when you were planning on killing her she wasn't doing the same for you?  What's she to you, Jake; a woman who would have you dead?  Let me kill her.  All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.
I hate to bust your bubble, but I wasn't defending you.
Mister, I'm calling you out.
'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off somebody gets hurt.
Not before I settle with you.
Oh, shit!
Yeah, I know.  You're TNT.  Just like dynamite.  When you go off somebody gets hurt.  All right.  Let's do this.
Hello?  Hello!?  Operator, I got disconnected.  Hello . . .
What happened?
Wouldn't know anything about it.
Wish I could help, Sheriff.  But if you'll excuse me I'm going over to Harlin's to pick up my car.  Then I'm getting the hell out of this place.
Not taking a drive, Sheriff. Heading out of town.
Sure, Sheriff.
What for?
Thirty-thousand dollars.
Hablar slowly, por favor.  My ingles no es bien.
No!
Yeah, sure.  You got change?
He's only just dead.  What was I supposed to do with him?  I can't take him away anywhere.  And nobody wants to take him for me.  Do you?
See.  Ain't nothing I can do but keep him here beside me.  That's where he belongs anyways.  Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals since the war when I lost my eyes.  He was just a pup then... a companion that's loyal, that'll keep coming back to you no matter how much you kick him...I miss him.  I'll see ya later, unless I come across something worse.
I'm a little short Pops. I'll catch you next time.
No and I don't plan on sticking around either.
Things ain't always the way they seem. You got to ask yourself: is it worth it? Day comes Earthmaker is going to look in your fucking heart! Then you better know what it is you're doing. <u>Are you a human being</u> -- or just one of them hungry ghosts out there floatin' around?
You expect me to believe that?
Live there?
It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it?  Not a wit.  Do you know why? Because you're a man without scruples.
Like you don't know.
How do you know if you've never tried?
I did?
Oh yeah sure. Why don't I buy you a plane ticket right out of here while I'm at it. I <u>know you</u>...  This is what you do:  Go to the house to see her.
Wait a minute.  Just listen to me...
Maybe I don't like being played, like she played us today.  Maybe I don't like that at all, Jake. I'm just pissed enough, maybe I'll rip the neck off my own grandmother.
Two-hundred dollars...I'll do it!  I'll kill her!
What?
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
Oz.
For what?
He's up at the Look Out.
Damn.  Gonna be another hot one today. Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed. Course don't want to get out for the cold one's neither.  Then of course the clouds come in...
Darrell--
Time.
Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
Another accident?  You got to be more careful.
It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.
Listen, man.  I got rolled half an hour ago for everything I had.
Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit.
Listen, Darrell, about that hundred-fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll--
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
Hablar slowly, por favor.  My ingles no es bien.
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
What happened to your hand?
No trouble at all, really.
Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road.
Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
I pack up and go somewhere else.
Nothing like a little liveliness.
Still playing?
How do you know he's still not here?
No.
Depends on what you call love. I grew up on a reservation. A patch of desert in the middle of nowhere. That's where they stick Indians, Bobby. That's where they leave us to die. My brother killed himself when he was 19 cause he couldn't take it anymore. There's no hope there... Jake was my ticket out. Mom and me.
You need a meal ticket is what you mean. Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.
Try me.
Nothing I understand better than a mess.
Yeah.
Is it pretty?
At night. He just sits there and laughs and talks to himself and counts it. I heard him. My Mom told me he had a hunnert thousand dollars down there. Maybe more.
It's not like he's a young man, Bobby. He's had time to live. It'd be quick. I mean, he wouldn't even have to <u>feel</u> it...  I mean, sometime in the middle of the night, when it's quiet...when he's asleep, you could just come up behind him when he's pounding on me and...
Because I know you're full of shit.
We don't have to kill him.  Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.  It was your idea, remember?  I'm doing this for you.  I'm doing this so you can fly...fly like a bird.
After dark.  I'll leave the back door unlocked.
It should be just up ahead.  Hold on ... there!  There it is!
You spent a day in Superior. I wasted my entire life there. I feel like someone just took a million pounds off my shoulders.
<u>I don't know why</u>!
I was just baiting him! Bobby, I had to tell him that to get his guard down. Just like you told Jake you was going to kill me!
But we all need that too. Hold him.
He <u>can't</u> help you now, honey!
No. Two of them. Two robbers. And they <u>both</u> get nailed... get shot by the old lady.
A hundred and ... Now you listen to me you deadbeat little punk:  I don't care if you got hit by a truck and run over by a steamroller.  You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars and <u>I want it</u>.  I don't care how you get it, or where from, but I want it on my desk tomorrow, or I'll show you what real bad luck is.
Shit I'm sorry!...you can't believe the strain I'm under. I'm just under a lot of strain here.
One way.
The ticket is 30.55.
What kind?
What was that all about?
Oh?
...But I bet the story she <u>didn't</u> tell you was the best story of all. How old crazy Jake <u>was really her Papa</u>. And she <u>liked</u> fucking Papa! And now she's killed the sonufabitch! Just like she's gonna kill you!
Wrong number.
I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you.  Remember?
Oh no! Oh please forgive me, Papa!
I said come on!
You stay away, Jenny.  I aim to mess him up, and that ain't a thing for a woman to see.
What fuckin grocery store, you fucking shithead idiot! You call yourself a police...
Yes.
Four.
What does that mean?
He's asleep.
I haven't been sick this year. I know that.
Megan, do you ever remember me getting sick?
Yes. Is this David?
My name is Megan Inverso. We went to college together.
Yes.
Jesus.
I don't know for sure.  ...I don't think so.
You've misunderstood.
Are you for real?
How did you know that man you bumped was carrying a weapon?
Or he might have been carrying a silver handled gun tucked in his pants.
One last question.
It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm David Dunne.
What's he look like?
How much can you lift?
Know what?
You're lying.
Okay.
Football wasn't the kind of life I wanted... For ten years I'd be by the phone waiting for a call telling me he broke his neck in a practice game. And if it wasn't that call, it would be a call telling me he blew out his knee or suffered his third concussion. I've seen way too much of it in my job... I can barely take it when my clients are in pain.  I don't hate the game. I admire the amount of skill it involved and, like everyone else, I was in awe of how he could play it, but I couldn't give him my heart and then have something happen to him. And it always does with that game.  It's not a thing many people would understand.
I believe comic books are based loosely on reality -- I believe there are real life equivalents of the heroes in those books that walk the earth -- I believe your husband is one of those individuals.
Why?
Where is it?
On account of they seen you was beatin' on their friend.
We was... lyin'.
Down the street and across. Greely's Beer Garden and Billiard parlor. Just ask for Alice and say you want a game of billiards.
Don't matter. They burned the table in '78 for firewood.
Nope.
They went out scouting when they saw your fever broke.
You want... a free one.
I... I guess not.  I didn't mean I didn't want one 'cause of you bein' cut up. I didn't mean that.
She back in Kansas?
I guess not, Bob. I don't like guns around.
Be careful with those, sonny.
You an' Andy get the hell out there. Find out where them other two went.
...They been fuckin' 'em, 'an tellin' every bow-legged one of 'em how they're payin' a thousand dollars to whatever sonofabitch kills them two boys which cut up Delilah.
Oh, shit, Bill, I guess nobody's gonna come clear from Texas.
You know how women kin lie... I knock 'em around a little, ask 'em where the money is, they say they don't have none?... but they coulda squirreled away that much, the five of 'em. Maybe.
Uh... yeah. Yeah.
I guess you are Three-Fingered Jack out of Missouri, killer of women and children.
D-d-d-duke. The D-d-duke of Death.
Meaning the duck himself, I guess.
Duck, I says.  "You have insulted the honor of this beautiful woman, Corcoran," said the duck. "You must apologize." But Two Gun Corcoran would have none of it and, cursing, he reached for his pistols and would have killed them but The Duck was faster and hot lead blazed from his smoking sixguns."
But he was called...
And?
Then he will kill you. That is why there are so few dangerous men like old Bob there... an' like me. It ain't so easy to shoot a man anyhow... an' if the sonofabitch is shootin' back at you... well, it'll unnerve most fellas.  Look here, let me show you somethin'.  See this here pistol?
Uh... hang the... uh... carpenter. I...
Nobody didn't kill Ned, he went South yesterday. He didn't even kill nobody. Why would anybody kill Ned?
L-lies... at first. About how you was just passin' through and didn't kill nobody... an' Little Bill kept askin' questions, mixin' him up, catchin' lies... an' then he'd beat on Ned an' Ned would cry and lie some more an' then... then...
Didn't scare Little Bill though, did it?
Same one as shot Charlie Pepper in Lake County?
Hold on, mister.  Son, this here pig gotta be moved outta this pen, away from them others. Penny, you give yer brother a hand...
Well, Uncle Pete said you was the goddamndest meanest sonofabitch ever lived an' if I ever wanted a partner for a killin', you was the worst one. Meanin' the best. On account of you're cold as snow an' don't have no weak nerve nor fear.
For cuttin' up a lady. They cut up her face an' cut her eyes out, cut her ears off an' her tits too.
Thousand dollars of reward. Five hundred a piece.
Huh?
Wasn't nothin' said about no partner.
What business?
Maybe, maybe not. Got him in the gut, I think.
You still think he's in there?
Tell me right off if you see him.
Shit... I thought they was gonna get us. I was even... scared a little... just for a minute.  Was you ever scared in them days?
First one what?
Well, I gu-guess they had it... comin'.
Should be easy killin' em... supposin' they don't run off to Texas first.
We done stuff before for money, Ned.
Cut up a woman. Cut her eyes out, cut her tits off, cut her fingers off... done everythin' but cut up her cunny, I guess.
It's just... she's a Indian an' Indians ain't... overfriendly.
You ain't like that no more.
You ain't like that no more.
Sure, I got to. Got to get supplies.
Yeah.
Naw. I bumped my head fallin' off of my horse.
I didn't see nothin' planted.
How far kin you see?
Yeah... you said that last night.
Not for me. I don't touch it no more.
He's dead, Bill.
I seen the angel of death Ned, an' I seen the river.  He's a snake, he got... snake eyes.
Tom?
Before I met your maw, God rest her soul, it used to be I was kinda... wicked... drinkin' spirits an' gettin' into scrapes an' all. Only she made me see the error of my ways an'... I ain't like I was no more.
Thought you was followin' me.
Oh, them.  Hell, I seen them.
Yeah?
Plenty of times.
Shit, Kid, you pulled your pistol... right outta the lady an' out the back window.
Three days? We could kill 'em tomorrow.
We don't need him. The two of us could do it.
We'll bury him.
You mean, am I gonna help you kill them cowboys?
Yeah?
You can stop looking. There was no coke. I've been in L.A. county with a guy they
We know, but our man says no way on the dope. This Hungarian tells me the whole bunch was pulling stumps for Turkey the next' day. They had no time to negotiate that kind of product and no means to move it.
&lt;&lt;I'll tell you everything. I'11 even say it slow enough for you to understand it. Just tell this man I want protection. Real protection.&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Are you sure?&gt;&gt;
Edie, please. I don't want to hear this right now. What did Renault and Fortier say?
Time for what, Edie? Time to look into me a little more, that's what. No matter how well you cover my tracks now, they'll find out who I am.
No. It's never going to stop, period. It won't take more than a week before every investor in this city is walking away from us. It's finished. I'm finished.
They ruined me tonight.
I hope I didn't disturb you.
I don't want to know.
Hockney was just a bad bastard. Good with explosives. Mean as a snake when it mattered .
I can run. I got no problem with that.
Verb - Roger, this is Edie Finneran. Edie, this is Roger Kint, he was at
They're gonna do a job. Three million dollars, maybe more.
Mr. Redfoot knew nothing. Mr. Soze rarely                 t works with the same people for very long, and they never know who they're working for. One cannot be betrayed if one has no people.
Mr. Soze will be most -
We know you can get to us, and now you know we can get to you. I'm offering you the chance to call this off.
We'll see.
Edie Finneran. She is upstairs in my office for an extradition deposition. I requested she be put on the case personally. She flew out yesterday.
You're lying.
I shivved him.
We want to meet him.
Keyser Sate or not, if Keaton's alive he'll never come up again.
I don't think he does. Not exactly, but there's a lot more to his story. I want to know why twenty-seven men died on that pier for what looks to be ninety-one million dollars worth of dope that wasn't there. Above all, I want to be sure that Dean Keaton is dead.
I know he was good.
You know a religious guy named John Paul?
I'm not a rat.
Let me tell you something. I know Dean Keaton. I've been investigating him for three years. The guy I know is a cold-                    + blooded bastard. L.A.P.D. indicted him on three counts of murder before he was kicked off the force, so don't sell me the hooker with the heart of gold.                        +
What lawyer?
Keaton always said: &quot;I don't believe in God, but I'm afraid of him.&quot; Well I believe in God, and the only thing that scares me is Keyser SOZE.
And this is why you never told the D.A.
I don't.
Then why didn't you help him?
He wanted me to live.
He used all of you to get him on that boat. He couldn't get on alone and he had to pull the trigger himself to make sure he got his man. The one man that could identify him.
He left you to stay behind and tell us he was dead. You saw him die, right? Or did you? You had to hide when the first police cars showed up. You heard the shot, just before the fire but you didn't see him die.
He programmed you to tell us just what he wanted you to. Customs has been
I'm not bait. No way. I post today.
Maybe so, but I'm no rat, Agent Kujan. You tricked me, that's all. I won't keep my mouth shut 'cause I'm scared. I'11 keep it shut 'cause I let Keaton down by getting caught - Edie Finneran too. And if they kill me, it's
The district attorney's office will comply provided -
Then prosecute. I will be very impressed to see if the District Attorney manages to bring in twenty-seven simultaneous counts of murder against one man with cerebral palsy. I would think a man with your job would agree with these alleged &quot;faceless people in City Hall&quot; you mention.
Nothing.
Neither does he.  That's where he loses.  This man's scared to death to go to court.  We only have to call his bluff.
How did you settle on the amount?
Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount.  Two Hundred Ten Thousand.  That would mean I keep seventy.
Yes.  It would be.
Mickey told me to come back to work.
... a Mrs. Doneghy called ... I told you that.
Yes.
Well, we...
...to get her heartbeat back...?
...almost nine minutes...  causing brain damage.
Just as you are, Sir...
No, I am not.  It's quite common in New York State...
No.
I'm just an M.D.
I know of him.
Nothing further, your Honor.
I'll rule on that presently.   Proceed.
No.
Yes.
Yes.
I...
After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in.  He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form.    And he told me to change the form.  He told me to change the one to a nine.   Or else, or else, he said...  He said he'd fire me.  He said I'd never work again....Who were these men...? Who were these men...?  I wanted to be  a nurse...
... that's all right.
What you thought!?  What you thought...I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred...
You guys, you guys, you're all the same.  The Doctors at the hospital, you...it's 'What I'm going to do for you'; but you screw up it's `We did the best that we could. I'm dreadfully sorry...'  And people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives.
What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life.  They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say...
Well...
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
There's nothing they can do to me.
It's my opinion it took him much longer.  Nine...ten minutes. There's too much brain damage.
Yes...I...yes.
Negligent.  Yes...it would have been criminal.  But that was not the case.
Whose side are you arguing ...?  I thought that you wanted to do something.  I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going  to ... I have an interest in the Hospital;  and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me.  They gave her the wrong anesthetic.  They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid.  You caught 'em.  Now: how many others did they kill?
...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me?
I've got nothing to say to you.
I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
Mr. Alito, please.
Yes.  Price...
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
Maybe what?
Do you want me to go...?
You're talking like a drunk.
Yes.
Who told you that?
Stop pressuring me...
No...no...
Dr. Gruber's not in.
He's not in, Sir.
Dr. Halpern's taking all his...
He's...you can't reach him, Sir. He's in the, on some island in the Caribbean, they don't have a phone.   He'll be back in a week...  If you'd like Dr. Halpern's number...
What do you want?
They killed her.  And they're trying to buy it...
You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
...Gruber's not bad.GALVIN Not bad...?  This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick...  And you calm down, all right?  Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse...'All these guys are God.  I saw them walk on water...'
No.
Right.
Right.
So what...?  The best is yet to come.  Check the TV Guide.  They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
So what do you want me to do? Concannon's going to try the case his way, I'm going to try it mine. You want me to go wee wee wee all the time because he's got some flack, got stories in the newspaper. I'm going to win this case.
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
All right.  Who wasn't in the O.R.?
Hello.  This is Mr. Dorchester in Records.  We're looking for Kathy Costello...
I don't want a mistrial.
You know how beautiful she was?   Her husband left her, and he took her kids .... They, they, they'd let you die in there.  They don't care.  Nobody cares.  The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care ... in Arlington ...?  They'd take her in.  Perpetual care.  They'd take her.  Fifty thousand dollars they want.  An endowment.
... and I have inquiries out to doctors, experts in the field ... there is, of course, a problem getting a doctor to testify that another doctor's negligent ...
Yes.
I, what are you talking about?  I talked to her this morning, and she said...
You live in the neighborhood?
Yes.
Yes.
Yeah.
We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes.   We were trying to restore her...
Should I?
The Big Boy did...?
Huh.
Ah? That complicates the problem.
San Francisco's changed. The things a that spell San Francisco to me are disappearing fast.
No, I'm all right.
No... no, thanks. A bit early in the day for spirits.  Well, I guess that about covers everything, doesn't it? I never married; I don't see much of the "old college gang"; I'm a retired detective -- and you're in the shipbuilding business.  What's on your mind, Gavin?
Then?
No.
There are things you didn't tell me.
But you knew about this.
Well, that explains it. Anyone could develop an obsession for the past, with a background like that.
And when she goes to those places...
Her mother told me most of then before she died. I dug out the rest for myself, here.
What happened?
Did she hurt herself?
Do you live here in the hotel?
No, a year ago! Where did you live a year ago!!?
No, Judy, you don't understand.
Yes.
Why?!
Judy --
You've got a thing about Ernie's, haven't you?
I told you. I have to go back into the past. Once more. For the last time.
Madeleine died here.
No!
But you knew, that day, that I wouldn't be able to follow you didn't you. Who was at the top when you got there? Elster? With his wife?
Your accident...
I don't know... Switzerland?
Oh, of course I remember that!  But then I must have had a dizzy spell, and fainted!
This afternoon.
Before?  Where?  Where had you been?
You like it, too.
I... didn't know where you lived.
Yes, I knew which one it was. It's out there, now. But I didn't think you'd want to be brought home that way.
Some people prefer it.
Wander separately? Ah, but only one is a wanderer. Two, together, are always going somewhere.
If I've been there? That's silly! Either you've been to a place or you haven't.
Oh... some, two thousand years, or more.
Of all the people who have been born... and have died... while the trees went on living.
The tall trees...
A room... there is a room, and I sit there alone... always alone...
I don't know. An open grave. I stand by the gravestone looking down into it. And it's my grave.
And so explain it away?  But there is a way to explain it, you see. If I'm mad? That would explain it, wouldn't it?
I'm here, I've got you...
No, never!
No, never! I've never been there! Scottie, what is it? I've never been there!
And it's a all real.
Madeleine!!
No three-way stretch? How very un- chic.
What's tomorrow?
Please!  And what happens after tomorrow?
What are you going to do? Now that you've quit the police force?
Johnny, the doctors explained --
Normal.
You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.
I asked my doctor. He said only another emotional shock could do it, and probably wouldn't. And you're not going to go diving off another rooftop to find out.
Okay.
This is a cinch. I look up, I look down. I look up --
Carlotta?
Did you need it?
All I said in the note was: "Where are you?" That doesn't sound desperate to me.
By whom?
Thank you, Mr. Leibel. Thank you very much.
Don't touch her. Call 911.
Bullshit it's not accesory. I didn't do shit. You call the cops, you explain it was an accident...
That's a horrible ugly comment. "Dead whore?" She's a person!
What?
Boyd brought up divorce statistics.
You're an asshole.
Why was the floor wet?
I'm not getting a ticket.
What are you talking about?
We have a dead woman bleeding all over the bathroom. What options? Call the police.
Sure, why not.
We can do this. We can get her out of here.
You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony?
What about the blood?
Have you ever done this before?
What?
That is absolutely not true.
We are all going straight to hell. Either hell or prison, whichever comes first.
Watch the tone fella.
I don't give a damn.
They won't figure it out.
They're driving me nuts!
Later.
They've all been real times. And as you prepare to enter into a new phase of life, as you prepare for new roles; father, husband, teacher, you will, as I have, come to except the letting go of of old ways. Soon, the mellowing will begin...
Don't ever stare him down.
What.
I got you.
Tomorrow.  We are getting married tomorrow.
Don't sweet lip me.
I'm with Tina. Is she there?
Where is she?
Fish?
Left side.
Here's his head.
I'm not talking to you?
What is her disposition?
Shut up Boyd.
What is the question you asked me?
Yes, you did. Now that is the question! That is exactly the question we should be asking ourselves. You tell me Fisher. What have we done?
Say it again.
I don't think that's such a good idea.
Now?
I'm getting really tired of your bullshit.
You hate women.
True.
What's your point?
What?
They need leadership.
I think I forgot the tent.
I'm not playing around. I forgot.
What?
What are you talking about?
I asked you to marry me. I'm ready for marriage. That's responsibility. That's growth.
Why? What's his problem?
Of course.
With all my heart.
Okay.
I'm not. What's the problem?
What kind of seats can we have?
Honey I don't have the time...
I'll call them from the road.
We're leaving from Adam's. Come send me off.
I will.
Not yet.
I'm working on it, I've made three calls.  I can't stop thinking about how much I love you.
I'm mad at you.
What!
I left a message. I think it's going to be okay.
Now?
I won't even discuss it.
No.
No Micheal did. It was an accident.
She's not alone...She's...Boyd...Oh God...He's gone nuts...He killed Lois and Micheal...it's all...
What money?
Like how?
The only proof is those bodies.
You never walked away dad. You could have walked away.
Just go ahead and say what's on your mind.
Buzzing?
I don't hear it.
Have another drink.
No. No. No. This is my doing. You see I'm gonna have my wahoo spark for my own. For Lois and the kids, for my brother, for Franco. I'm gonna turn myself in. I am all that. I'm gonna do it for sweet Lois.
Yup.
How do you know she's dead.
Yeah. I'm thinking about Micheal's Franco Harris fixation. You know how Micheal was always harping "Immaculate Reception?" I've seen that play. A lot of times...and I have to say this... Franco was lucky. Flat out, right place, right time. That's it. He was where the ball bounced. You get me?
That's right, "Pup Corn." Doggie treats. Little snacks for dogs. He's figured it out. There is a hole in the market and he's going to fill it. Spends all our money, works himself into not two but three heart attacks getting this shit up. After fifteen months, the big day arrives, the first box of "Pup Corn" pops off the belt. He comes running home with that box, pulls us out of school. We all pile into the living room, must be fifty of us, and in comes "Shelmer," our 8 year old mutt. "Here Shelmer," my dad cries. He's got that little fucking pup corn in his hand, "Here girl." This dog will eat anything, she eats rocks, anything. She walk's up to my dad's hand, looks down at the little pellet, licks it once, turns around, walks out of the room. Shelmer rejected the "Pup Corn." Fifteen months of my dad's life, right there. Not one dog ate Pup Corn. Not one. Three months later, "Pup Corn" shuts down. Chapter Eleven. My father never got over it. Never.
Where?
I want a black one. A little black brother. That's a big problem it seems to me. Lack of racial integration. That's a big one. You think?
That's what I'm thinking.
Okay great. What will that be?
Are you guys gonna fill this place with kids? You sure got room for them.
Drum banging real times.
I KILLED MY BROTHER!
No, the children sleep with me.
You'd like me to kill them?
Yes, yes.
Smoking makes me feel ill? It's these filthy fag ends. I won't mention in this company what's upsetting you.
Really, Don AMALIO, there's not much point in making a fuss.
A very short while, Uncle. I've been given permission to stay only a few days.
And this innocent child.
Wasn't that cowardice?
I have asked her but she's ungrateful. Sometimes I feel like hitting her. When I talk to her about the convent, she turns to stone.
I'd be really ungrateful, if I didn't like you, sir; you took me and my little girl in when I didn't know where to turn.
Just say the word, sir, and I'll do anything.
Yes, sir.
It's only that ... It's all very odd, sir.
That's it.
And in the vegetable plot?
He was asking for it.
No, not mad at all: she's rotten with religion.
I'm bored. I'm alone all day and I don't know what to do.
There are some curtains and drapes, but they're all very old.
That's stupid! Plaster! It can still be used.
I've been expecting you; I got a letter from the lawyer.
I'm not sure yet. I've had a shock recently, and I'm only beginning to get over it. Perhaps I'll go back to the convent one day.
Don't worry. Nobody's going to disturb you.
You can come and live again in the big house if you want. Now that I'm alone, I can settle down anywhere.
Then let him go and he'll follow you.
How much do you want for him?
Where?
But, miss ...
Yes!
The retreat will start soon. You can leave tomorrow morning.
Right, let's go.  And keep the compliments to yourself. I don't like them.
I'm only good at making people laugh.
Ah! Pleased to meet you.
Oh, you slept well; don't worry.
No, I don't want to.
Can you tell us what's on the disc?
I accidently triggered a protection mechanism which erased the entire program.
Real, my ass. It's an overblown game.  Anybody ever catch that fucking psycho?
Don't give up, Parker. Not ever.
Parker Barnes, I'd like you to meet Crime Czar Elizabeth Deane.
Then I guess we're even.
Until we know what new influences are affecting him, we can't be sure.
I think we both know who did.  What's so urgent?
Got it.
We have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology. Under the authority vested in me by the President, I'm giving you temporary reassignment.
You're going to put your theories to practice. I'm sending you into the field.
Not from in here.
Call off the manhunt looking for me. I didn't kill the transport guards.
No, but I've confirmed the reelection rally is the target.  How much C-4 is missing?
Barnes used to work for him when he was still a cop in the field, remember?
I'm still making adjustments...
Show's over unless I get to see what you've been working on after hours.
It was me, what?
I couldn't just let them make you bring down my degree of difficulty. I'm a triple-twisting, double back flip off the high platform, not a swan dive.
Help me get out of here.
No, I just like the effect a tape recorder has on you.  How you feeling today?
That's not true, Parker.
It was just like before, wasn't it? Wasn't it?  But you are making progress. Instead of killing seven people to get the one you're after, this time there was only one other person involved.
Manson didn't kill the first cops to arrive on the scene.
Do me one favor  if you shoot at anything, make sure I'm nowhere near it.
Checking my pulse. It's elevated.  You enjoy frightening me, don't you?
I'm still working on it.
I've been in prison, remember?
Creating a whole far more dangerous than the sum of its parts.
Dahmer carried the head of one of his victims in a bowling bag for over a week. Kept it in his locker while he was at work in a candy factory.  We need to get a look at Sid 6.7's final profile.
In order to find him, we have to understand what makes him tick...
How did you get your hand out?
Now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. Sid is going to evolve.
What I do know is that whatever he's becoming, Sid 6.7 is going to be even worse than he was before.
This is my area of expertise.
You like baseball?
No! Grimes isn't back. He's only one part of Sid. Sid 6.7 is a hell of a lot worse than Grimes ever was.  Get a hold of yourself!
You knew the entire time? Can you give me one good reason why I shouldn't kill you right now?
Lindenmeyer never got over wanting to kill kids with more musical than he had...
Duck!
Now, is that any way to talk to an old buddy? I mean, just because I'm carrying around the joy of killing your family inside me doesn't mean we can't be friends.
Why's that?
You wouldn't be here if it wasn't true.  It's true, right?
I could tell you stories:  Cecil B. Demille:  Alright? The Greatest Show on Earth:  He needs an elephant,
Okay.  Okay.  The <u>Suitcase</u> Bomb...
What can it hurt is they offend me.
...twelve years.
Look, look, look....  He's fine, as long as he has his medication.
Come on.
Shot down, Forced down...  You guys are <u>missing</u> it... You're missing the <u>opportunity</u>
Okay.  And she's alleging...?
Who's got the story?
You gotta give me a day.  I need a day.  He's sick, get it out <u>now</u>.  Get him on the phone'n tell him how sick he is.  We got to get it out before the story breaks, so we aren't quote, responding to it. Issue is as a bulletin.  He's got some rare strain of...
We don't need it to prove out.  We need it to <u>distract</u> them for two weeks til the election.
I'll see you at National.
....we landing?
What did they find out about the Gulf War?  One shot: one bomb, falling though the roof, building coulda been made of <u>Legos</u>.
In the yellow ribbon.
Tonight.  Well, you've started a Tempest in a Teapot.
Eight Days To Go
An <u>Albanian</u>, a young Albanian Girl.
Now, the Old Lady starts to <u>Weep</u>, Big Bird shrugs off his secret <u>Service</u>, goes to her, and covers her with his own coat.
Yeah...what was I talking about...?
Y'wanna follow the Cattle Drive?  Sleep in the Winter. What does <u>Moss</u> want...?  Matchmaker comes to the Levinsky Family.  Mr. Levinsky, Mrs. Levinsky, would you entertain an offer of marriage for your son Saul, from Princess Margaret of Great Britain.  Well, they think, she isn't Jewish, but she's well to-do, a nice old family.  Alright, yes, they say.  We would consider such an offer.  Wonderful, matchmaker says, My Job is Half Done.  Now, Look:  I got the <u>file</u>, from the L.A. contingent, I got the day-by-day, of how...
I'm doing my job, Too.  Would you give me a... do you think you could call off your Dogs for a minute.
...those limp-dick ... <u>turncoat</u>... I <u>thought</u> they let us out of there too easy.....
Fine.
Well, you know, "The Whole Thing's Theatre..."
How do we explain <u>that</u>?
Guess who <u>I</u> am.
Dashes and Dots.  And those dots spell out a message in the Morse Code. And that message is, "Courage, Mom..."  And he got the message through. "Courage.  Mom..."  Well, to the Family of William A. Schumann, to the Men and Women of Unit 303, to my fellow citizens <u>I</u> say "courage."  I have informed the Albanian government, and I inform <u>you</u>, that we will not rest until the safe return of Sergeant Schwn&nn.  I'm told his unit mates gave him the nickname, "Old Shoe."  Ladies and Gentleman, we will not <u>treat</u> him like an Old Shoe, we...
...we own it?
...how ya feeling, boy?
Well, let's not be too sure, why is that?
Yeah, I need a list, people in Military Special Pro...
Heavy weather East of here.
S'all very well, but when the Fit hits the Shan, somebody's going to have to Stay After School, and who do you 'spose that might be.
I'm interested in the Security of My Country, Mr. Brean.
Well, that's what we're <u>doing</u> here...
When's he coming back...?
I'm gonna <u>tell</u> you why...
Uh, it's a slogan.  From, uh...
That's from the ... it's got to be from the...
The...
Is that true?
And <u>if</u> you never won an Oscar, How'd you like an ambassadorship...
...that's what it is.
I'm sure they do.
Ten Days.  There going to be any Back End in this thing?
The men and women of Detachment Three-O-Three, with their...
No, no, no, no, no <u>after</u> the airport.
I saw it on TV.
It's not too <u>clean</u>...
In the Folk Music Section.  We'll be in in...
Oh, you're gonna love this:
What do you mean he won't do it?  He won't do <u>what</u>?  He won't do the sp...  It's what?  It's <u>corny</u>?  <u>Corny</u>?  Is that the word?  Of <u>course</u> it's corny.  We wouldn't have him <u>say</u> the flippin' thing it wasn't corny.  Put... listen, it's not a question, we're locked <u>in</u> to this speech.  NO We're, Are You Listening?  LOCKED IN.  We're, we're playing way <u>past</u> it, we're <u>past</u> it -- it's the set-up for...he has <u>got</u> to say the speech.  Tell Ames to meet me at the West Gate in...
Hey, lemme close out the thing in style.
...the Albanian Campaign.  This... this is history...
Yeah, well -- it's only one word difference.
Cause I don't think <u>this</u> dog is gonna hunt....
Yeah, well, perhaps...  Speaking of which:  I have a <u>prescription</u> here, I'm going to give you the <u>number</u>, I need you standing by with a <u>crate</u> of the stuff.... it's ... what is it?
We're going home.  We're going home together...
Ha ha.  No, no, not <u>now</u>, not <u>now</u>, of course, But Someday... when they tell <u>this</u> story...
He raped a <u>Nun</u>...
No.  You're right.
I'm looking for a phone...
Why are they ...
He ain't seen <u>nothin'</u> yet.
British Regiments drape their drums in Leopard Skins.
...one minute:  Demille needs an elephant for a reshoot.
Yeah, good good good good good.  And They're <u>So</u> <u>Secret</u>...
...they have the capacity to Meld into the <u>Woods</u>, and...
Cause the beans, y'know, y'can tell if they're <u>puttin</u> stuff in it.
He's not dead, Ronnie.  He's just a little understandab1y, <u>fatigued</u>.  Let's get him to some help...
That's right, we'll take a nap.  We'll get you to Washington, we'll get you Back to your Buddies, and...
No, I think it's ... can we see the calico <u>kitten</u>...?
Sell it all.  What the hell, so I'll only make ten million.
Mr. Lynch, I swear to you, he's lying!
I don't think you're being fair, sir. You assigned me this guy, and you know he's got a history...
No, thank you. I knew the minute I laid eyes on you, you had what it takes Bud. Just keep it going.
Thanks, Marv, with that I might be able to qualify for welfare.
Hello, Natalie -- guess who? That's right, and you know everyday I say to myself, today could be the day... So what do you say... will you marry me? Then please can you get me through to Mr. Gekko?
Cindy. Having sex with her is like reading the Wall Street Journal 'cept the Journal don't talk back. 'Sides this AIDS crap is ruining romance, nobody trusts anybody anymore, gotta get a blood test in the toilet before you leave a bar together, somebody oughtta invent an AIDS dipstick, no kidding, make a fortune. I gotta get to work... Z's today.
Didn't I tell you to knock before you came in here?
Get the hell out!
I want to make it up to you. Bluestar, put all your clients in it.
How's Mom?
...gotta run Dad. You stop smoking, you hear?
No, what I see is a jealous old machinist who can't stand that his son's become more successful than himself.
Your responsibility, Dad, is to present the facts, not your opinions, to the men... you're gonna destroy their lives, Dad! Don't do it to 'em. Give it a chance. Let the membership decide for themselves, Dad. Please.
You speak for me, son.
First of all, Mr. Fox, you can't just come barging in here. And what makes you think it's his birthday?
Lisa. Gordon? Oh, Mr. Gekko. Sure. Would you, uh, like to come in?
Well we're thinking of putting up a statue of you in the subway. I hear you're moving up in the world. An associate already. Not bad. How's Margie?
I just want to let you know Mr. Gekko I read all about you at NYU Business, and I think you're an incredible genius and I've always dreamed of only one thing -- to do business with a man like you...
Jackson, Steinem...
...Yeah, and we're working on some other interesting stuff.
Can't tell you that, Mr. Gekko.
Bud Fox, I look at a hundred ideas a day. I choose one.
Yeah... not bad for a City College boy. Bought my way into this club and now every one of these ivy league schmucks is sucking my kneecaps...I just got on the Board of the Zoological Society, cost me a million; that's the thing with WASPS -- they like animals but they can't stand people!
I remember that deal. You were involved?
...Gordon.
How much?
I'm talking to a stockbroker who wants to run an airline. It's gonna take me two years and 2000 headaches to turn Teldar Paper around, what do I need this dink airline for? I'm up to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake.
I'm sorry, this can't wait.
Tell me, Gordon--when does it all end? How many yachts can you waterski behind? How much is enough?
Obviously...
Gordon.
I gather you're a decorator.
Break it.
The conference, oh yeah. Fine. We reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us.
You're not trouble by any chance. Are you?
I'll bet he's got an opinion on the stock market too. This apartment is already ahead of its time. I call it the "demolished" look. They've already heard about it at House and Garden and they're coming next week to photograph it before it gets... lived in. Is that alright? I'd love to have it in my portfolio.
I'm kidding, I'm kidding, we're still young, Darien. So what's money anyway when everybody's making it, it's all relative. After all, this is not the house in Connecticut, this is just a crash pad good for a couple of years...before we slip our two lovely kids, Yuppie and Fruppie into the Lycee Francaise.
It's not me I'm worried about...You know Darien, the only reason we haven't slept together is because we both know we will -- and not knowing when was the only surprise left. You owe me, I want you, what else is there...but you, me, the world.  ...right here...make love to me...now...  Stop me if I'm going too far.
So did I, till I hit 19 and found I had all the royal habits and no throne. Mom got by but I had to go to work just like you. Only the skills I had were shopping and making friends. So...that's why I do what I do, what makes you tick, Buddy?
...Janet get my father on the phone and the two other union reps, urgent...
Oh Christ!
Can't get a little bit pregnant, Bud.
Harold, you don't mind strolling around the block a couple hundred times, do you?
It's over you, Gordon.
Now tell me, why would I want to do that?
Don't worry Sunshine. Bud and I had a little talk. We came to an understanding.  I want you to go back to him. Soothe him. Help keep his head straight. Okay?
Come on, we both like Buddy. But this bleeding heart puppy love act is over the top... It doesn't fit.
He's flowing, Gordo. Piece of cake.
Done. You'll hear from my lawyers. 8 a.m. Good night.
So why are you dating Jonathan?
But he still has something Mark hasn't.
Just give it a break China ok? CHINA Jeez.  Can't even take a joke
It's eleven forty-five let's go
A little?
You don't understand.  I recognized his face now come on.
Forget her Mark, she's a bitch
Sell my soul?
You get yourself a regular job, as Satan's disciple.
Maybe before the event, never after.
Mom.
But mom, I NEED THE CAFFINE - BADLY
So much.
Someone crying.  A girl.  I thought I was crazy.
Do you really think so?
Because, I don't know, because sometimes...sometimes I forget things...and ever since Caitlin left, ever since my daughter left for school, there've been...I fainted and...  Why is this so hard?
Mm-hmm.
How do you know it's a she?
I don't know.  My aunt used to use my uncle's old pajamas and a candle.
Well, that's what we're here for.
That he doesn't...see me, or, you know, that I'm...that's something's wrong...with me.
Almost.
Well, I don't think I've seen you since the reception at Dean Ackerman's last year.
No.  I'm just not sure what you mean.
At the party.
Who's that?
Um...yes.
Is everything alright?
Um...sure.
You must have been very proud.
Good.  I'm good.
And so far my day has consisted of taking pictures of my roses for the garden club.
Please.  That's all I need.
What?
Nothing.  It wasn't anything.  I've been on edge lately.  Maybe since the accident. And I'd prefer, I really would, to just--
Artsy little village down seven.  There's a guy there who sells my work.  I had just dropped off some paintings and as I got in my car...I saw Norman sitting at this little cafe.
We need help.  Please let me call the medium.
What if he was?  Do you think he wanted to bring that up again just when you're trying to make a new start?
It's Saturday.
Nice.  Almost done.
Fine.
Not like this.  We were never like this.  I want to go over there.  After dinner, we can--
To make sure she's all right.
Is it gone?
Unless you need me to come home...
There were some noises.  I didn't want to disturb you.
What kind of whispering?
Madame Curie, Jonas Salk, Norman Spencer...
You're kidding.
Well, that's nice.
I'm so sorry.
That's just mean.  Oh.  Jody wanted to know if I could get her some.
Did you call about the Feurs?
No.  Look!  In the window.
She could be out.  She could be sick in bed for all we know.
Who did?  Mrs. Feur?
Claire, listen to me.  I know you're under some strain.  But there's no such thing as ghosts.  They don't exist.  Our neighbor did not kill his wife, and I...wait, why aren't you dressed?
...Don't get all...
I know I'm not at the center of the bridge.
Harvey says he's amazing.
I never said I wasn't upset.  Of course I'm upset.  I miss her terribly.  But I know what I saw and what I heard...and it wasn't some "symptom" of something...
...and I don't think I'm some lonely, middle-aged woman cracking up.
You know what I've got at stake with this paper.  You know that.  I can't help but think that you're doing this now to hurt me, or to sabotage me somehow.
I...
What's wrong with me?
It's her.  This is the woman who I've seen.
Stop...
STOP IT!
What's the matter?
What?
How did she know where it was?
Incredible.  We should take a drive before they're gone.  Spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast.
You don't have to do that.
IT'S TRUE.  That's...you have to believe me!  Oh God, I'm telling you the truth!  I did what I had to, Claire.  She was gone.  There was nothing I could do for her.  I did...I put her in the lake.  I rolled the car in...and I watched it sink.  And I've lived with that image ever since.  I couldn't just stand there while everything-- my career, us, everything, just washed away.  Don't you see, Claire?  She's doing this!  This is exactly what she wants you to think!
Shhhh.
MADISON!
You've been shadowing the family for thirty years.  It's only fitting you give one af us away.
Lasher is my legacy - not Michael's.   Aaron, I've seen the pain in Michael.  I can't bear to see anymore.   He's not to know.  Swear to me.
With her family.  Rowan's mother died yesterday.
He made that quite clear, yes.
I don't want it.
Rowan Mayfair.  Who's calling...?
A very tired one.  I've been up all night - and I would .like to rest before the funeral.     Have your lawyer -
Out of the question      Rowan, coming here will not change the -
A Mayfair it ever I saw one.
I'm tired.  I need to rest.
Other properties as well - here and in Europe.  And vest holdings - in sugar, oil, gold, electronics.  Liquid funds over eighty million.  tmpcssible to put a figure on it all. All yours now.
The lamplight.  That's all.
She didn't feel them
'He'...?
Stop it!
I'm NOT like you!  I'm NOT! You're cruel -
Nooo...  NO!  Stop!
I LOVE him!
I LOVE MICHAEL.  MICHAEL!!
Change me, Rowan, and we can change everything...
Leave me alone!
You went into the cells --- and you changed them.  How...?!
They want to come back.    We have a pact - of mutual desire and  consent.  The Mayfairs ar. a beautiful tapestry.  I have weaved you all together - from the start.   I brought Petyr Van Abel to Suzanne.  He had genius in him.  Scientific, precise.  It was a perfect start. And on  it has gone - father to mother... sister to brother... father to daughter...
I know.    you are my son -
Like this...  LIKE THIS...?
I'm glad you're around to say it.
You still feel that crazy...?
He fools around with his patients too.
Captain's orders.
All I meant was -
Is this the part where you try and talk yourself out of how good this is...?
Let's see...  Next you tell me all the terrible things about you - and prove that we're doomed to fail - right...?   you hate kittens and puppies, you've drivin all your lovers to suicide --and those mysterious deaths at the hospital were really -
You stop it.  you're loving, and gentel..  You're the most remarkable woman I've ever met --- so stop telling me I don't know what I feel just cause you're scared.  Cause it won't work.
Michael - this place is increadible.  You - you're brilliant...  The things you created...
God knows, I'm intriguing.
Wait a minute.  Rowan - what is going on...?
Rowan...   Think of what's in that book.  Think of last night!
Hello..
Than letts get rnarried, Michael.  I could put a spell on you - and make you say yes.
Hey - I'm getting married in the morning - I already gave up drinking. one crutch at a time, Doctor.
Mm-hmm...
No.    This is unreal...
That's not funny.
Talking to me dear...?
Your beneficence.
Lock the door.  Lock it
What were you talking about...?
Go ahead.
Nothing is wrong with me.  I know something's in there - and so do you.
Gotcha.
Bullshit!  Let me in!   Mikey - there are people who can help figure this ont.
If you like that type.
Just nervous.  Getting married, you know.     Got the rings...?
Just don't fall off any ladders.
Why don't you take a few weeks off - you're due some holiday time.
Well, if you could come sometime just before we close, then I could show you everything and  then we could go for a drink to discuss the finer points...
No - I've been abroad for a long time...
I really don't know what to say
I hated being treated like a failure - looked down on - my sister used to do that - I hated it - I should have known, when we got married - in a registry office of course - she wore maroon - I just wanted a white wedding  I think she thought I was a ticket to the good life. I had a good job, prospects. And she was a slut - I didn't know until too late. One day, I came
Tell me about your adopted MOTHER
It was wrong - all my life I have been cheated - cheated of anything good - I shouldn't have been born - I was a mistake - my natural mother was a whore - that makes me...
Then make it stop...
Nothing could be better...
I am ashamed of what I have done ELLEN. When I read what you had written it made me think - look into myself - I haven't dared look into myself for a long time - I have stopped ELLEN, I can't carry on - I won't carry on. All I want is to start a new life - I want a second chance...You are good to me - you don't condescend, you're intelligent, and very beautiful...
No - I'll have you after
I don't know - it's your house ELLEN
I think he's fine - I don't know why you have this thing about men - it would be nice to have a guy in the house for a change - I don't think he would hurt a fly.
I would prefer it if you kept away from LESLIE
Leave!? Who the hell do you think you are?
I'm here about the so called disappearance of your husband - It's best if we let old bones lie. Know what I mean?  I'm working on the WHITE ANGEL case now - and I've got to check all known murderers or suspected murderers for the last five years... And that means you...So where were you last THURSDAY afternoon around five...
At home alone - where were you?
Surgery? Are you a doctor?
I'm good - I was just making a delivery near here, so I thought I would see if you were about...
I'll be sure to...
Who said anything about surgery...It'll only take a moment.
She smiles at everyone, Ted.  She's like a newborn with gas.
You have a better chance of being hit by a Mack truck with a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip.
That's crazy talk.
Astronomical.
Maybe he got promoted.
What is it now?
Dead?
Then there must be a whole room, made completely of chocolate.
With a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip.
Chicks are like buses. If you miss one, don't sweat it. There's another coming 'round the corner.
These are real, live women?
So that's a maybe?
Which you pulled, hard!
I miss those days, when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence.
Of course, dumpling. Its very nice of Ted but...
We wanted you and Jimmy to have it someday. Something real and honest.
Dad, please.
Well, why should I?
...not the pit.
We're grateful, Ted. It's not that. Those Craftsman tools...they're a dream come true.
You ordered a Winnebago?
Watch your tone, mister.
They're in the ignition, silly.
I know.  I'm Ginger. Miss April.
Hang in there, I'll think of something.
Before we knew it, we created the most popular men's magazine in the entire nation. The rest is history.
Giving you up was the most unselfish thing they ever did. When they founded "Heaven," they wished they could take you back but it was too late. All they could do was build the empire, knowing that someday it would all be yours.
So, what brings you here at his hour?
My room?
You can't come back. That is, you can, but your things will be in the room you currently think of as mine.
I meant biologically.
The school dumpsters used to overflow to the point where the stench was unbearable. My award winning exposé changed all that. The city added an extra weekday trash pick-up.
Come on, Julie. Don't screw up. You have some real talent.
I'm trying to help.
You never know around here.
Second only to unbridled, narcissistic conceit.
You've got enough people kissing your ass.
Put your eyeballs back in your head, William Randolph. I'm on assignment. A girl has to fit in.
The ozone must be fully depleted on Planet Ted.
A father is nothing but sperm, Ted. It takes a real man to be a dad.
There's gotta be something. We have to dig deeper.
Well? Where the hell are you?
I had a Portuguese boyfriend who could read the phone book and melt me.
You've seen one naked breast, you've seem them all.
You're quick. I like that.
I know where you can find any number of naked girls who'd love to hop on board.
Yellow pages?
Save it, honey.  We want to hear every detail when you get back, but we don't want you to run up Mr. Zukerman's phone bill.
What is all this? When are you coming home?
But how would we pay our bills?
Yes, sir. I'll brace myself.
You think I ought to just tell them thanks but no thanks? I don't want your silly billion dollar empire?
Deaf ears, Mr. Nelson. I answer to a higher power.
Of course I like girls.
Seldom? No kidding?
You are a multi-media magnate. The Tycoon of Tits. The Baron of Bottoms.
I would have been laughed right out of Xenia.
It's really going to be strange going home in a couple of days.
You seem like you're anything but lazy, Uncle Billy.
I'm Ted Nelson. I guess you already know that part.  For two years I've been the editor of the high school paper in Xenia, Ohio. I've won some awards, made a difference. I've always had journalism in my soul. Now I know why.
I wish I knew you years ago, when my brother was alive. I wish he never gave you up.
All is fair in "Heaven," Ted-baby.
Eat a power bar.
Thanks.
I love Antigua.  Maybe I'll come visit you.
What if something distracts it and it snaps anyway?
She still work there?
And the other girl, Kelly.  Suzie's niece.
I'm fine.  Nice TV.
Not at first.  He was still inside but he wasn't moving or anything...  He said we had this secret.  And that now he'd be able to help me... because we were close... Something like that.  I don't know.  It's hard to remember, exactly.
Still doesn't explain why he couldn't catch up with her.  I mean how long does it take to put on a shirt?
Yeah, well, Van Ryan got his.  I don't imagine he gives a shit now.
You could say that.
Just check out the car.
Those are Suzie Toller's teeth.
The swamp, most likely... Lombardo's a swamp rat, knows the body will never be found there.  But he's made a mistake.
We need to tape the interview, Suzie. No one will see it but us.  Now when was this, that Mr. Lombardo gave you the ride?
What was that?
The line I get on this guy, is that he's done half the women in Blue Bay.
And what do they say?
Bit, scratched.  But I had her pinned. She calmed down.  I was going to cuff her... She said she thought she was going to be sick.  She asked to use the bathroom.
Suzie Toller's.  And that's the only thing saving your sorry ass.
Yeah... okay... he did
I wanna go home now.
Okay!  He did.  He pushed me to the floor and he did it to me.  Now, can I go home?
I said he did.
Your Honor... Please...
No!
No.  But I mean... just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would...
Nothing.
I was raped.  By Sam Lombardo.
Aren't  you forgetting something?  Your coupon.  We gotta have it.
Mr. Lombardo.  We're running kind of late.  How about if Nicole goes on to the Mansons?  You could give me a ride when you find the ticket.
Stick?
Yes.
You know what it takes.
Duquette.  Forget him...
Fair enough.  Let's go make a statement.
I was just thinking about where I'm gonna stay.  I lost the house.  It's like waking up from a goddamn nightmare.
Just like that?
That's right.
You can't...
So Suzie, you called us, remember?
That's cop bullshit.
About what?
Don't you see what this means?  You really think Sam and Kelly are gonna give you a third of the money?  You, the pill-head with the rap sheet?
Hey, Ray.  Guess whose name is on the numbered bank account besides yours and Sam's?
It is and I don't.  Ordinarily...  But, I mean... there's this kid standing in front of you crying...
Well, shit, you're the cop, they don't teach you to disarm people, shoot them in the leg or something?  You weren't supposed to kill her for Christ's sake.
Kelly was supposed to be framed, not killed.  What I'm telling you is, I don't like surprises.
Come on, man.  I'll make a sailor out of you yet.
Put Kelly on too.
Good.  Just keep telling yourselves that, the only people who can fuck this up is us.
Listen, Kelly skipped school.  Have you talked to her?
To tell you the truth, I haven't seen her since Friday.
I'll work on it.
Is this leading somewhere?
Call me that again, and you're going to find a boot where it doesn't belong.
That?  Oh, it's a kind of Chinese fighting... I was sort of caught once with a lovely Chinese girl out in San Francisco.  Her big brothers were kind enough to teach it to me  I've got a book on it, if you're interested.
Come on, let's at least see if we can find Dr. Pemberton.
You'd think if Loveless is going to kill him he could at least be a prominent citizen.
Sounds like a train.  Looks like a train.
That rules out Willard, Vermont; Willard, Minnesota...  Willard, New Mexico?
I'd love to stop him, but have you noticed the hundred armed men?
That's... that's the criminal mind about to stomp our sorry butts!
We'll see.
I get that feeling.  You know, Mr. Tyler, I'm the kind of woman who doesn't believe men are much more than a complete waste of time. But after spying you across the room, I'm tempted to suspend my disbelief, at least for the evening.
I don't recollect ever being compared to a pistol before.
Really?
My friend?
This is Colonel Richards.
Exactly.  Any number of nations would love to cripple our scientific growth.  And what better way to tip the scales in their favor than by killing off the greatest minds this country has produced.
On my way to Denver...
When you're three and a half feet tall, sir, life turns you into a comedian whether you like it or not.... Come with me, won't you?
I deal with some tough customers.
Who was this partner of his?
It's a smelting retort.
You're not going to use it, are you?
He thought you were a woman, Airk!
Nothing you wouldn't have done it my place!
Hey, remember?  You don't need my help, Madmartigan.  Little rabbit trap like this?  Come on!  I could open it for you, but I wouldn't wanna insult you!
They're not after me.  They want the baby.
Then come with us.
Yes...?
What is Tir Asleen?
No I'm not.  Have you really looked at me?  I'm short!  Even for a Nelwyn!
Anything you hurl them at will turn to stone.
I don't want courage.  I don't want to be a warrior.  All I've ever wanted was to do magic, real magic, like you!
Oh, if I could do that I'd--I'd turn Burglekutt into a toad!
You're not a woman.
I'm not going to let this baby die.
I will!  But I need help!
As above, so below.
Are you a warrior?
You hear trouble.
I will.
Time to leave.
Because she's sick.
I thought you had her!
Madmartigan!  You saved her life!
You?
The universe is a living creature, like you and me, Madmartigan.
Ahhh!
No, it's too big to be a Nelwyn baby.  It looks like a daikini...
Absolutely not.
Use the philosopher's stone!  Hur- ry!  Invocation!  Release them!
Why?
Surrender!!
Yes!  Raziel!  She lives out on that island!
Us??  We'll never catch them.  Any- way, we're all done, Teemo.  Let's go home.
Who??
John, why?...
I thought I was the English.
Pretty much.
Who'd you see?
You don't say.
I'll be all right. You just do as I say.
Maybe.
Tell you what... why don't you and that blonde  what's-her-name  come over for dinner Sunday. How 'bout that.
We're looking for a suspect. We've reason to believe he's still in the area.
I would not be too sure.
Gunshot... they'll file reports... they'll find me.
Two days.
Yes. It's good that someone can have the use of them. Besides, in your clothes you'd stand out to strangers.
Telephone? The Gunthers across the valley. They're Mennonite. They have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even.
I'm going this morning.
I know what he said.
I can whack people. I'm hell at whacking.
There was.
I know.
Aren't you? After today?
Land! Are you crazy? I'm no Amishman and I'm no farmer! I'm a cop. That's what I know and that's what I do!
Johnny, what the fuck?
Johnny! Where the hell have you been?
Say again?
Not yet.
Better you should get off my front porch before I get my mace!
Fred. The way he looked when you screamed at him.
At home you'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way.
Of course not. We're going to Baltimore. It's much nicer in Baltimore.
Oh, but he doesn't do it every day -- just once or twice a week.  And he can't catch her old cat, anyway. And now she says she's gonna get the sheriff, and --
Yes, darling.
There, there, lie quiet now.  You just had a bad dream.
No, Aunt Em -- this was a real, truly live place.  And I remember that some of it wasn't very nice....
If any!
You'll be hist...
Please, sir.  We've done what you told us. We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West.  We melted her.
Do you presume to criticize the....
Are you all right, Dorothy?
Catch him, you fool!
Who, me?  Why, I'm not a witch at all.  I'm Dorothy Gale from Kansas.
No, I'm afraid I didn't.
But, how do I start for Emerald City?
Yes.  Say goodbye, Toto.
Oh -- yes.
Oh, you....
Stop her!
Oh...
Oh! Oh!
Oh --
Lions and tigers and bears!
Hah!
It's the Witch!  She's followed us here!
And -- and I got a permanent just for the occasion.
Huh?  What'd he say?
Stay with us, then, Dorothy.  We all love you.  We don't want you to go.
They would?
Do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains?
But I'd face a whole box full of them for the chance of getting some brains.  Look -- I won't be any trouble, because I don't eat a thing -- and I won't try to manage things, because I can't think.  Won't you take me with you?
To Oz?
What?
Oh, you don't think we're going to stand by and let her get away with fireballs and bees, do you?
Of course, I don't know, but I think it'll get darker before it gets lighter.
It's too late!  There they....
Oh, rubbish!  You have no power here. Be gone, before somebody drops a house on you, too.
Ah --
What was that?
Not nohow!
You mean she bit you?
Oh, she bit her dog, eh?
B-B-B-B-B-But if we do that, we'll have to kill her to get it!
Ho -- ho --ho
Oh - look out.
I haven't got a heart But I got a palpitation.
It makes you nervous?
Well, I --
Well, you can't.  As for you, my fine friend -- you're a victim of disorganized thinking.  You are under the unfortunate delusion that simply because you run away from danger, you have no courage.  You're confusing courage with wisdom.  Back where I come from, we have men who are called heroes.  Once a year, they take their fortitude out of mothballs and parade it down the main street of the city.  And they have no more courage than you have.  But! They have one thing that you haven't got! A medal!  Therefore -- for meritorious....
Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss...?
Its part of some plan. She dresses it up like a terrorist attack.  The explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium.
Elektra would control it all.
If I dont get to the Boa before he gets to Maidens Tower, M is dead.
We go down to the torpedo bay.
That which does not kill me makes me stronger.
Hes not through yet. Renard doesnt blow up five million dollars unless he knows theres more coming in. Hes working for someone. Someone who wants to stop the pipeline.  And they hired the perfect killer. One with a vendetta against King...and you.
Then Robert was right about a Russian connection.
The inside man?
Your last chance. Give me the name.
Have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva?
Yes.
You are wrong, Mr. Bond. In fact, I am the only person who can do it.
No.
No. Youll be safe here.
Two. Shaken not stirred.
Really?
I used my body on the guards.  It gave me control. I got to a gun and I took my chance.  Ive never told anyone that.
You do what you have to do, but Ive called in M.  Shes en route from London even now.
You turned Renard.
But you would have something to gain by killing Robert King. And stopping his pipeline.
You are out of your league.  Shes working with Renard.
Former KGB surveillance post. The Dye Factory was just a front; now it turns a good profit.
Of course...
Thirty minutes maximum.  Of course, I assume we'd be in the fortified command bunker at the time of the launch order.
You oughta see upstairs.  It's a slaughterhouse.
Small army, from the looks of it.  He put up one hell of a fight.
Hnnrr.  -- Like to masturbate.  Shit once a day.
Mm hmm.
Collect me?
Then you're sleeping with Dreiberg?
Memories of the future are just like any others.  I've tried not to dwell on the unpleasant ones . . .  You won't die of cancer, Laurie.  There won't be time for that.
You're the only human being I care for.
I explained this.  I can't.  That's not the way it happens.
Us.  You mean the Watchmen.
You did the right thing, Daniel.  Let's stay in touch, okay?  Good night.
Good.  Be careful, Daniel, don't let up your guard.  Look, I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until all this blows over.  You two would be welcome to join me.
Adrian -- you've lost it.
Dan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa.
His . . . whatever.
Sure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I'm thirty-eight years old!
Not at all.  You look very -- dashing.  Here, you pick one.
I'm an open target, Dan.  If you're with me --
-- I thought it was time for a routine maintenance check.
Me neither.  Mine barely even fits.  The thing is, I try to remember why we did it, and I can't.  Helping people, or righting wrongs, or trying to save the world . . . I don't know.  It all seems so abstract.
It's a peace rally.  The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.
Toilet clogged.  Short fat turd.  Let's get out of here.
What do you mean, frame-up?
Veidt's assassin.  Leads to follow.  Can't just --
Coward.  Giving up.
Okay, let's just . . . thank you.
He's the one.  He's been the one all along.  Stalking us.
Oh sweetheart, just a quick one.
I don't know why you've been keeping me here, but you're in deep shit --
Maybe I'll do that.
Edgar William Jacobi, aka William Edgar Bright, a.k.a. Moloch.
Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.
Ever see one of these before?
Dr. Manhattan, right.  Now if you boys care to join me, we'll go save the world.
Looks like a diner.
There's some folks I want to keep tabs on. Dirty, tattooed, uncivilized. Your kind of people.
Fine, but I'm not gonna be no Bulldog Omega 5.
If you're trying to push my buttons, you're on the right track. Don't make me question my own judgment, X.
Yeah, I sent you pictures. Here's what I'm thinking. If they take out the cameras and sensors, they could probably put a bomb in this thing. You drop it in the water in the Red Sea and three weeks later it's swimming up the Potomac.
Yes it does.
Who says you're the good guys?
You're a jerk-off, you know that?
I'll go in with a team. But first I'm going to need some intel. I'll have to put someone inside, someone new, someone they won't see coming. One of their own.
The scum of the Earth.
So the odds are up to fifty-fifty? I can deal with that.
You wanna check it out? Come here.
What weapons do you have?
Go to hell.
Mind your business.
Why are you still hanging around? Your business is finished, you should go home.
Hey, take it easy. I'm just a dude trying to make a buck.
The eyes don't lie. All this has gotten to you, hasn't it, Petra? You came in as Yorgi's girlfriend and you stayed because it was fun. Now you don't like it so much, but you're in so deep you can't get out anymore. Tell me if I'm wrong, Petra.
It's a long story, but yeah, more or less.
Not an option. Just get up slowly like everything's cool. Petra, trust me. You just hung yourself out to dry for me, I'm not gonna let you down.
They'll kill you, you know they will. Besides, there is no back door. Keep smiling. Ready? Now.
No, something worse. He says it's a surprise, but I know him. This is his masterpiece.
I don't know what's going on anymore. I thought I was square with that dude. Now everybody's switching sides like it's the WWF.
We'll have to go after them.
You don't have to do that.
If they launch it, I know how to bring it back.
Go to the water, it's that way!
It has to surface to release the nerve agent, right?
Use your grenades! Maybe we can blow it up underwater!
I stole your beat, huh? Guess you forgot to brown-nose the right people.
They come in any other styles or colors?
Think again, that's government property. You have to sign for everything. I've got one more that wasn't on your list.
You have all this talent, and you waste it. You won't take a single endorsement deal. Meanwhile those other guys have their own video games! But no, you've got too much "integrity" for that.
I've been on a plane for twelve hours, I think I'll stand.
You killed me, remember? Now I have to hide out here with you. Where have you been?
Why you dogging me up?
A parachute. This does not argue well.
It's like you said, every man for himself.
He flashed his badge to half the bar when he bought his drink.
Sorry, man, don't know what you're talking about.
Ferrari's, Lamborghini's... high end pasta rockets. Ten to start.
I'm somewhat less so. We seem to have a bit of a problem...
Don't forget goatee boy. I greased him up on the diamond run.
I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls.
You think I'm after money? I told you, my friend. Anarchy. Time for a change. Money is good, but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves.
Sure, if that's what you want. Why not? It's all human nature. So we just have to launch our baby and wait for the decline and fall of civilization as we know it.
We all do.
So where do you think he's planning this larger demonstration?
You saw what happened tonight.  You think Magneto won't come after him again.  You think he won't come here if necessary.  This is a school, for God's sake.
No.  I'm...  I don't know if we can do this without Charles.
What's that?
I wanted to talk to you.
Yeah?  Well I don't like to talk about my past.
He's busy right now.
Were you now?
What is it you're failing to get at? Are you interested in me?
I've seen a lot of rings.
Control, Senator...  we teach them control.
A very powerful mutant who for some reason has taken an interest in you. I'm not sure why, but until we find out, I must ask you to stay.
To find Rogue.
The brainwaves of mutants are quite different than those of the average human being.
Actually, Magneto helped me put it together.
I'll go.
They're all asking how you're doing. Are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone?
What?... miss me?  Charley, I'm gonna walk out the front door and trust me, it won't be soon enough for everyone here.
Let's just say that I am out to make some radical changes.  Now come on Charles.  For old times sake, for your sake...  Leave him to me.
The way what is going to be?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO DO?
Yes, my dear, he is.
He is the fifth leading authority in his field.
Yes, sir.
Baack!
Probably just some nearby cottage. Nothing to worry about.
MMmmm.
You're incorrigible!
Goodbye, darling.
Surprised!
Love you! ...Well, why don't we turn in?
No, of course not.  I just meant...
Darling, you mustn't worry so.
You've done everything that's humanly possible, Frederick.  Oh, darling, I'm so worried about you -- you need rest.
Of course I am.  Now come along like a good boy.
It seems fine.
I don't know what you mean, sir.
Will there be anything else?
Fron kon steen!
One week -- I'll see to it, sir.
I beg your pardon?
Dr. Fronkonsteen!
I am a scientist...!  not a philosopher.
No, it's pronounced Fron kon steen.
No, Fred ereck.
You must be Igor.
What hump?
I beg your pardon?
What wockers?
I wonder what's got into them?
I got frightened all alone upstairs, so I came down here.
What?
Two switches over there, but I wasn't going to be the first.
No, but when I first came in, there was a light coming from behind that steel door.
Could be raining!
You've got it, master.
What?
Wait till he sees the bill.
It's the only way.
MMMMMmmmmmmm.
MMMmmmm!  MMMmmmm!
Zis is an old Transylvanian Lullaby.
I'm not sure I...get your drift.
Yes, you may... but don't make any noise.
What a filthy mess.
Yes!
I think you've done it, master.
What do you think we should do?
I see what you mean.
I know Frederick.
...But an intellectual relationship, like this -- we could have as often as we wanted.  Three times a day -- anything!
MMmmm.
Yes, sweetie...I heard you.  So! I'm ready for you, meine Liebe.
MMMMmmmmm!
Do you know the theme from 'Doctor Zhivago'?
Food!
Food!!
Now just one moment.  There's no need for roughhousing.  Have you ever tried a tip?
Could be.  Across the river into Zululand. . They might just be waiting there for us to show up... .them stabbing assegais pointing right at our bellies!....
They spurred onto high ground, My Lord, full of spirit and looking for the Zulu. Full of sport they were, My Lord.
If I've got it right, My Lord, you lead an invasion into Zululand, for I see it all around me, but "why?" is the question my readers will ask. "why?"
So attack is your defence. Well let's hope Cetshwayo will offer his Impis full destruction.
I have received intelligence from, sources of my own that the Zulu Impis are moving North of here and threaten your left.
And I assure you, you do not In fact I'd be obliged for your best advice. What have your scouts seen?
