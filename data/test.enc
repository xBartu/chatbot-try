Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
Have fun tonight?
But
do you listen to this crap?
I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.
She okay?
They do to!
Where did he go?  He was just here.
He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation.
Bianca, I don't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding.
Listen, I want to talk to you about the prom.
You're ruining my life'  Because you won't be normal, I can't be normal.
You are so completely unbalanced.
I don't get you.  You act like you're too good for any of this, and then you go totally apeshit when you get here.
Listen, I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School.
I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .
Joey never told you we went out, did he?
In 9th.  For a month
Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.
But
Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?
I'm missing something.
Always a pleasure, Brucie.
Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in?
So -- which Dakota you from?
Get out!
Who is she?
Why do girls like that always like guys like that?
I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me.
What about him?
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
You told me that part already.
You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.
What've you got for me?
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
Cameron -- do you like the girl?
What'd you do to her?
What's the worst?
The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy?
Leave my sister alone.
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
I just upped my price
But she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her. right?
The people at this school are so incredibly foul.
What'd he say?
You hate me don't you?
I say, do what you wanna do.
Okay?
You're not okay.
And I'm in control of it.
When you were gone last year -- where were you?
Wholesome.
State trooper?
No, I won't go with you
Answer the question, Patrick
How'd you get a tux at the last minute?
It's just something I had.  You know
Besides, I had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl.
As a parent, that's my right
Bianca did what?
You know, fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives.  It means we've become spectators.  Bianca still lets me play a few innings.  You've had me on the bleachers for years.  When you go to Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to watch the game.
Cool pictures.  You a fan?
I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure.  Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey's.
Are you telling me I'm a -  "non-smoker"?
You were right. She's still pissed.
I missed you.
You're completely demented.
What's a synonym for throbbing?
Jesus!  Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?
Have a great time, honey!
What just happened?
What are you listening to, chicken ass?
Your Eminence, there is only one way to settle the matter.  And that is to make the journey.  I am ready to risk my life to prove it possible.
If God intended our proximity to Asia, do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world?
It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez.
I could be gone for years.
Are we going to argue?
They took everything...
I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands?  Is it not so?
Don Alonso de Bobadilla.
How could I be?  The mainland has been found.  Exactly as I said it would.
Father...
What does he say?
I want you to tell me everything you remember, Father.  From the beginning.  Everything.
They don't see sin in their nakedness.  They live according to nature, in a never ending summer. The islands are covered with trees, filled with blossoms and fruits. And...
But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.
Why do you wish to sail west?
All of them!  Just lies!
What are you saying?
My son, my son...  Your certitudes are sometimes frightening...  Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.
I suppose we're both old men now.
New worlds create new people.
Do they have such thoughts?
We can't raise the wheel without it.
Where can I meet this man?
We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!
... But there is worse.  He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...
Oh no!  No!  Shit!
I'm coming with you.
I brought you some letters.  It's really fan mail.  Women mostly.  One wants to buy you clothes, another sent a check. Another wants a check.
Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.
...my little sister and I shared a flat - I came home one night and a man was raping her.  His gun was on the chair... He came at me and I shot him.
Did you ever turn tricks before?
I came here.  I had no money.  I knew no one.  I couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could've made a lot of money.  I considered it, but... it's not who I am.  They pay me below the table at Ludwig's.
Are you alright?
What are you doing?
Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.
I'm gonna propose.
Who's there?
It's your crime scene now.  You can do what you want.
Hmmmm.
My folks are.
Why not?
Look - let me talk to her.  Any leads I get, they're all yours.  Just let me have a first crack at her.
C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.
I took her there for a shower and that's it.
I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she's innocent.
But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.
Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.
I kill someone famous.
So tabloids don't have to do re enactments.  They going to have real movie this time.
I understand, but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you.  Is this somehow related to the fire department?
Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
Eddie, are you okay?
Hey, honey.
You didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues.  You could give me something.
Don't worry about the damn phone.  I won't answer it.
Yeah.
Promise?
I hope this prick doesn't run.  My knees are killing me.  Stay behind me.
Ready?
Okay.  You ready?
Any chance we can do that again?
Give me the address!!
Please join us.  Come on forward.
In here, says he wants a million.
Did you hear what I said?
Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?
Turn that off!  Get the bags.
Whore?
Get in the bathroom!
I did.
You are success story?  I am success story!  Why do you say I and not we?
I'm serious...this - this is a great American film.  Full of violence and sex.  And I want my credit.
We spent it!
Yes, the money is good.
It's easy to learn.
You've got a call.
And you, you'll pay for what you did!
I speak English.
A cheap hotel.
No.  Go ahead.
We're takin' him.  Don't argue!
Well, he killed my partner!
You okay?
What's that on your forehead, Max? That's a nice attention getter.
How did you start the fire this time?
Where you been, man?  We got a celebrity!
Mouth's clean, too.
You see Eddie's face when I gave him the timer?  Wish I had a picture of it.
What??
Now that you know him, maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him.
Bobby, Bobby!  Where're you hit?!
It was my finger that pulled the trigger, but I'm not morally responsible.  My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of.  How could I know. I'm not a doctor.
CONTINUED
CONTINUED
Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?
Oh?
No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
Good morning. How's it going?
Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
Hal?
It's the last one.
I didn't do that Frank. I took particular care not to freeze them.
I guess not.
Sorry to interrupt the festivities, Dave, but I think we've got a problem.
You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?
You probably also know that we found them okay.
I'm not questioning your word, Dave, but it's just not possible. I'm not capable of being wrong.
I am prepared to do that anyway.
Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called.
'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
Oh, that's such a delightful age.
He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.
Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal.
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
Well, shall we go through Documentation?
Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon
That's right.
Yes, and I'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it. Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S. convention.
By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
I see.
Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?
Yes, Hal, what's up?
I know you did, Frank, but I assure you there was an impending failure.
Name?
This is three years old.
We don't wash 'em, ya know.
Now how's your memory doin'?
I don't give a damn about his girl...
Maybe you shoulda stole a better truck, Tonto.
They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.
Hey, don't you think a hair stylists got any interest in gettin' it on?
You're in a hurry.
What's the matter with my place?
I said police.  Now drop the goddamn gun.
I hear you've got visitors.
No way to start a partnership.
Quit playin' cop and undo this cuff, Jack, I need to talk to this man.
I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.
Hey, this works pretty good.
Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn "trim" hunt... stop moaning.
Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.
You really do have onoe, huh, Jack... what's her problem besides you?
I been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers. All those clowns ever had going for 'em was a gun and a badge...
I'll tell you what happens if you lose... you tell the truth for once.
I'm gonna enjoy this ... here, I'll even loan you my badge.
This place don't seem real popular with the brothers.
Let's go.
This sucks.  A maniac gets hold of my gun and goes all over the streets killing people with it. So, instead of me being where I oughta be, which is in bed giving my girl the high, hard one, I'm out here doing this shit, roaming around with some overdressed, charcoal-colored loser like you.
Where's the goddamn car?
I suppose you'd never be like Luther and let a woman get to you...
Doesn't it get... Tiring?
A long time agb Luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain ... that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row...
No class...
We missed.
Thanks for callin' in... and I guess Maybe... Look, I'm sorry I called you Watermellon nigger... those kinds of things. I was just leanin' on ya, doin' my job.
Yeah, I see her.
Why?
Hey, how'd my car get here?
Is that what this guy Ganz had in the hotel?
Tell me that's not the same guy.
Bullshit red tape.
Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
You know, if you let me come over to your place once in a while, you could put on a clean shirt in the morning.
You know something, Jack, you really are hopeless.
Thanks for the coffee.
Look, spare me the macho bullshit about your gun...
Listen, Goddamn it if you think I'm happy about it, you're nuts. I just gotta take care of a few things, okay?
No wonder you're so popular.
Elaine, I gotta put you on hold...
You real down?
How'd they take it back at headquarters?
I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.
Who the hell are you?
What do you want?  What's goin' on?
We'll follow you.  Take it slow,okay?
Instead of worryin' about Reggie, you better worry about me...
Don't mess with me. How much?
Vano da, mechteba?! Soun domo kala chon hammas!
...would you like a drink?
He's a she!
She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.
We have to save the world.
Leeloo's in trouble?
Did you see that..thing..swallow our battleship like a gum drop?  You can't even tell me what it is! I ask you for options you give me bullshit. Give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards.
Uh father, I know she's been through a lot... but the sacred stones..we don't have much time..
I got it!  Everything  here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel... and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel!
Where's Leeloo?
You're a good man... She was right to have chosen you...
I don't have time... I need to know.
Yeah?
I don't want a million - I just want one.  A perfect one.
I don't need one.
Uh... at least fifty.
Finger..man..I'm sorry..listen..I was on the way over but I had a fare fall into my lap.. y'know one of those big fares you just can't resist..
...Priest...
I'm coming!. Ma, what're you talking about?
Fuel level 6.03..Propulsion 2x4...
You have nine points left on your license..
...Quiver ladies, he's gonna set the world on fire right here from 5 to 7! You'll know everything there is to know about the D-man. His dreams, his desires, his most intimate of intimates.  And from what I'm looking at intimate is the stud muffin's middle name. So tell me my main man... you nervous in the service?
My main man! Please don't leave me here alone. My head's killing me and my adoring fans are gonna tear me apart! Get me outta here!
Oh, yes! Do that! You treat me right, man. Tell me all about yourself, your roots, your personal life, your childhood dreams...
Maybe we oughta be going, what do you think?
Why?... Why would you need me?
Isn't that a Z140? Alleviated titanium. Neuro charged assault model?
Thanks..
This is all that survived?
Have you identified it?
Talk English Doc.
The compositional elements of his DNA chain are the same as ours, there are simply more of them tightly packed. His knowledge is probably limitless..
This thing solid?
I want your best man on this!
They just landed in the desert.
Staedert, do you read me?
...Not far, now.
Your clothing reeks of it.
Okay, I believe you.
You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it?
I'm okay.  Please, honey, I can't explain.  Don't use the phone, just pack a bag and get out.  I'm on my way.  I'll be back at the house in three hours.  Call me from the hotel when you get there
Tom...
What was I supposed to think happened to you?!
What?
She died in her sleep three days ago.  It was in the paper...
You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend.
What do you want?
He might be interested... but it would mean another five thousand.
You brought the money?
Excellent.
Don't let Longdale's questionable choice of weapon give you any ideas. If his fey little gun puts enough little holes in you, you'll be just as dead... and so will Max.
What can I do for you, Mr. Welles?
I figured you share information.
For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.
Files are mostly by state and year of disappearance.  We try to keep the children and adults separate. No eating or smoking in here, but there's a coffee machine in the hall.
Yeah, who's this?
Who is Machine?
I want his name.
What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?
You got absolute zero.
I never killed anyone.
You know how my tapes sell.  People eat this stuff up.
Yes, I do have something to say.  I insisted on being here as soon as I heard Mrs. Christian contacted you.
Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies...
Give me the film.
Once you pick it up you can't put it down.
Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.
Remember me?
I need some information.  Thought you might be able to help.
Not quite.
... Hello... ?
What you saw tonight, we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend.  We're talking about stuff where people get hurt.  Specialty product.
I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't yanking you around.  There's no such thing.
Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.
Who is he?
I know if I had to pick, it'd be "Choke," or "Devil."
What's next?
What's this?
He's odd.
If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...
You don't have any other choice.
It won't work like that.
I deal in divorce cases.  Corporate investigations...
I'm not positive this means anything.
One was for two hundred thousand, one dollar and thirteen cents. Another was for three hundred thousand, six hundred fifty four dollars and seventy six cents...
You told me to look, so I looked.
How are you?  Having any luck?
I didn't think there were private detectives anymore, except on TV.
If there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but I have to ask.  Your husband... he committed suicide?
September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared.
Why do you think he did it?
I had to ask.  I apologize.
People remember me from the news.  Can you drive me back now?
It's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See, I know a little about missing persons.  When kids run, they almost always leave a note.  It's guilt. They want to say goodbye.
Do you think the police did a good job?
Hello... ?
They brought her into the room... one man, he put a knife to her throat and he raped her...
Yes... I remember Mary
No, sir, he is not.
Okay, I'll take it all.
Hey, since when do you play Thomas Edison?  This looks like Sheila's.
I'm sure they're around.
No really, it's a fable.  The 'guardian of good' dreams.  It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up.
I know.  I hardly have any time to study.
You've been up all night?
Then you saw him, too?
No offense, or anything, but it's kind of hard to swallow.
He's going after Debbie.  I gotta stop him.
So?
Hey man, we're all sorry...
Been up with Alice.
Something the matter with the cuisine?
Honey, we went over this in therapy.
I'll tell you later.
Who says I don't like you?
Mommy...?
Where is he?
What do you mean?
There you go.  Love you.
That's in the past.  Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.
Where are we going?
Thanks for everything, Dad.
Since when are you such a smart shopper?
No!  I won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  You're coming home.
Hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile.
I really think you need to calm down now, okay?
And so is your baby.  You've got more than just yourself to think of now!
What?
Give up, Mark, it's hopeless.
Mark, are you okay?
Do you think I'm an idiot...for being in love with her?
Whoa, slow down.  How're you gonna hide from a guy like that, leave the planet?
I couldn't do that, Mark.  He's my last link with Dan...No, I want him.
Poor woman...
Have another one, sounds like you need it.
I should have suspectcd, when I heard that 'Doctor.'  I thought it was your father.
That may be.  But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here!
That's enough, Holloway.  I've told you before, wearing boards on your shoulders, and parading with a stiff spine doesn't auto- matically endow you with back- bone - !
They're so remote - cold - beautiful, the stars.  But now - I wonder -
Maybe - just 'maybe' - when their ship doesn't return - they'll decide not to come here, after all.
So all of a sudden his only son drops out of school, be- gins making noises like a pacifist.  A real egghead, do-gooder, and crackpot!  'Ban the atom tests!  Junk the nuclear subs!  Spend the mili- tary budgetfor peace!'
We're stuck tight!
Here - keep these.  It wants me to come alone.
With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable.  Take sidearms, and flare pistols --
Excuse me, Skipper---
Skipper - could you take a look here...?
Excuse me, Captain - there may be one last, desperate chance - a one-in-a-thousand shot...
I'm - afraid I have some bad news for you, Reef -  You'll have to share quarters, this trip.
'Doctor' Neilsen?  When did <u>that</u> happen?
Determine extent of damage, immediately.
That's a <u>face</u>???
Why not me?  What am I - the closing act?
To navigate, won't you have to... see your way?
You plotted the course of Cyclops?  Then that's <u>our</u> course!  Wherever <u>he</u> goes, <u>we</u> go.....until we get him!
...if Jack told the truth, he could be free by the time he's my age.
I know he's due for the last two years. I was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in.
The good news is we haven't got to your car yet. The bad news --
-- the bad news is there's a problem with Gordon's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night. Figured you'd know something about that, Wade.
He's on to us!
We bought you.
Done much shooting with that rifle yet?
If you get it?
You might not kill it.
You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it.
I get it.  No sweat. You'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead. And you'll have him by coffee time.
You gotta be more careful about that shit. Gordon or one of those guys sees you smoking that wacky tabacky around me they'll expect me to bust you. And I'll be outta a job.
Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him.
I gotta make a report to Fish and Game. I was just wondering, that's all. What'd he do, to shoot himself, I mean?
Saw him do it?
Open the door, will ya?
Yeah.
Those are the Hoyts.
I bet you did lots of bad things.
Why? Why not? You know these kids from when you went to school here. It hasn't been that long.
It's fun.
Jesus, why?
Sit right there by yourself if you want. Wait for her by yourself. That's fine with me. Just dandy. I'm going downstairs.
Are we going in this?
C'mon, we can always sneak a Big Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your favorite. What do you say?
You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?
Tomorrow, Gordon.
Huh?
Don't go playing policeman.
You don't want the extra police pay?
I wish you had. I'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader.
On what you pay me?
I won't. You interested?
You and Mel Gordon?
Me and Jill, we just had a little spat. She felt kind of left out, I guess, from not knowing some of the new kids --
New hat?  Jill's up, I see.
You okay?
I'm sorry about what I said.
...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else.
No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.
I can see what you looked like as a kid.
Then... I guess you have to.
Of course! I would've heard.
What happened?
It makes me sad.
Hold on!
You're talking about a goddamned ticket, from when I passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something?
Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.
Well, I guess -- that's what he said.
Rolfe.
How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.
Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed?
Pop, for Christ's sake!
Love! What the fuck do you know about love?
Nothing in the fucking house to drink. Not a fucking thing. My house, my money, my truck -- stolen!
Yeah, brother, look, I was calling cause -- has there been anything on TV in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley, Evan Twombley?
It'll come out Jack lied and the kid'll get hung for it.
Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.
Get some sleep.
So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.
Oh NY god... oh my god... oh my god...
There they are!
Put your pilot on.
How we doing, Colonel?
Aw, man. You're torn up pretty bad out here, sir. Do you have any elevater control.
He's dead then. They must have killed him.
Walter, if you have a point, make it.
Can we do that?
You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore.
The rest of the secret service?
We've stopped dumping... but we've only got about twenty minutes of fuel left.
You're pointing a gun at me.
The world is such a dangerous place and we can't always protect our children.
You got what you wanted. You going to release us now?
Now since we've had very little luck getting Washington or Moscow to cooperate, I wondered if you would be so kind.
This administration does not negotiate with terrorists.
Someday, you'll regret my nature.
Mr. Caidwell, the ground's a few miles away. How do you propose getting us from here to there?
Don't.  I know spin control when I feel it.
Where are we sending it?
Please, Mr. President. You're going to get yourself killed. Is that your solution?
What's going on?
Yeah, right.
*                     We could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge.  The second amendment types'll love that.
Shit.
Elaine.
Ted, what's wrong?
Let's relax tonight, just the two of us. I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti.
Eat this spaghetti, Ted.  It'll make you feel a lot better.
Ted, we're taking off!
I've never used the word insane, Ted.
The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very sick.
Elaine, I'm going back there.  Just hold onto that stick and try to control this hunk of tin as best you can.
What will happen to him, Ted?
You can eat balanced meals, exercise, and take Geritol.
Elaine, ask ROK for a field interference scan.  Those sun spots might give us a problem with our communications.
Elaine, I'm sorry about that little outburst a moment ago.
Come on up, Jimmy.  Say, that's some puppy.  What's his name?
Joe, you don't want to blow that thing and kill all these innocent people.
No, a bomb.  Now, as discreetly as possible, I want you to move the passengers into the lounge.
You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.
Don't talk to me about Elaine.  Outta my way!
Not if the people change together in relation to that love.
Ah, won't you sit down?
No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men.
I'm sure we'll both make it...but just in case one of us...well, is there a message you'd like me to give someone?
Both pilots!
Surely you can't be serious.
Captain, how soon can we land?
You'd better tell the Captain. We've got to land as soon as we can. This woman has to be gotten to a hospital.
It's a big building with patients. But that's not important right now. Tell the Captain I must speak to him.
What was it we had for dinner tonight?
What did he have?
You know I haven't been able to get near an airplane since the war. And even if I could, they wouldn't hire me because of my war record.
Elaine, just hear me out. I know things haven't been right for a long time. But it will be different...like it was in the beginning. Remember?
Is it? Because of my mistake six men didn't return from that raid.
What's his problem?
I think they're getting the hang of it! When we re-enlist I'll teach them baseball!
There's a little girl on board who's ill and...
Excuse me, sir. There's been a little problem in the cockpit and I was wondering...
Mr. Striker, the passengers are ready.
I know... Why don't you hang around for a while, let me entertain you? It's Matt, right?  Now tell me the truth, have you ever... made it... with one of us?
I like my horizons narrow.
You okay?
Well, if it isn't Detective Jetson. Forget you hip waders, big guy?
Get the picture?
Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It stretches.
I believe I should interview the widow alone.
She didn't know him.  But she said her son might.
Who said that?
You know that guy?
I don't think I could ever learn to read that shit.  How long did it take you to learn English?
And what was that one about my mother?  That was a good one.
So, she keeps you on a pretty short leash, does she?
I'm going home.
She's going to divorce me.
Well, let's roll, George.
Jesus, this is major.  Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me?
They had months in quarantine to develop the plan.  Porter, with his chemistry background, must have somehow come up with the formula for the drug.  Hubley manufactured it -- at the refinery.  Strader, through the nightclub, established a distribution network.  And Harcourt--
George, c'mon -- lighten up.  It's a beauty of a case.  Don't sweat it -- we got him by the short hairs. He ain't gonna make any more of the shit.
I never thought I'd say this, but -- for once in my life I think I'm willing to wait for back-up.
You said you wanted the biggest thing I could find... Well, this is it.
To be honest, it's hard to say.  I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me.
You know I've been over all this with Fedorchuk and Alterez this morning...
You guys finished the postmortem on Strader yet?
How can I go?
What?
This floor's freezing.
Whoooah!  No shit?  I'm impressed.
Set down sixty meters this side of the telemetry mast.  Immediate dust off on my 'clear,' then stay on station.
First squad up, on line.  Hicks, get yours in a cordon.  Watch the rear.
You did okay, Bishop.
You had them eating out of your hand, kiddo.
No.  There's no way!
It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse.
If I go.
I hope you're right.  I really do.
Looks like you company can write off its share of this colony.
We're talking thermonuclear explosion.
How may drops is this for you, Lieutenant?
Where are your parents?  You have to try...
What is it?
At ease.  I'm sorry we didn't have time to brief before we left Gateway but...
Well that's great!  That's just fucking great, man.  Now what the fuck are we supposed to do, man? We're in some real pretty shit now!
Outstanding.  Then all we need's a deck of cards.  All right, let's move like we got a purpose.
They'll get us.
Hicks, don't let him leave.
Looks like it stung him.
You can't help them.  Right now they're being cocooned just like the others.
This service tunnel is how they're moving back and forth.
You remember you sent some wildcatters out to that plateau, out past the Ilium range, a couple days ago?
Bad dreams again?  Do you want something to help you sleep?
I don't want you for a friend.
Newt.  Look at me...Newt.  I won't leave you.  I promise.
Well, some kids can't handle it like you can.
No, it's different, honey.
Gone.
Don't go!  Please.
Burke!  Open the door!
Look, I can see where this is going.  But I'm telling you those things exist.  Back on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs.  Thousands. Do you understand?  I suggest you find it, using the flight recorder's data.  Find it and deal with it -- before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise...
Follow me, please. The Archbishop would like a word.
Oh!
The marriage!
Katherina! I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to write another aria for you. Something even more amazing for the second act. I have to get some water. Her mother is lying on the stage.
What?
No! I won't have him back.
Hardly.
Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat.
And how will you make him keep it?
Don Giovannnnnnnni!
Do you think that's funny?
Sra-I'm-sick. Sick - kiss I'm - my Kiss my! Sra-I'm-sick - Kiss my arse!
No!
Sssh. What is it? Tell me.
Yes!
Yes, my love?
Half the receipts! Stanzi!
You're not going to do this?
Who was that?
Why not?
Give me one reason I can understand.
I see.
Are you sure you can't leave that music, and come back again? I have other things you might like.
Come back tonight.
I'm paying these people. Do you realize that?
Oh, now I'm a bad housekeeper!
Perhaps a little refreshment first? A little coffee, or a little chocolate?
May I try it?
An interesting idea, Majesty. But -
Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism.
I'm sure there is a way, Majesty. Some kind of a little contest. I could perhaps put together a small Committee, and I could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty's wishes.
Sire.
I don't think you understand me, Court Composer.
As a matter of fact, one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well!
Oh, thank you.
Majesty!
Why so?
Well, what is it about? Tell us the story.
It is new, it is, isn't it, Sire?
And German?
What do you mean, Sire?
Really? How delightful. May I ask when you marry?
Bravo, Mozart. Most charming. Yes, indeed. Clever man.
May I introduce my father? He is on a short visit here and returning very soon to Salzburg. He would so much like to kiss your hand. It would make his whole stay so memorable for him.
It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?
Would you tell me why?
But it's new, it's entirely new. It's so new, people will go mad for it. For example, I have a scene in the second act - it starts as a duet, just a man and wife quarreling. Suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly - a very funny situation. Duet turns into trio. Then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in. Trio turns into quartet. Then a stupid old gardener - quartet becomes quintet, and so on.  On and on, sextet, septet, octet! How long do you think I can sustain that?
Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it.
Yes, sir.
She's very tired, poor creature. You know me: I'm a real pig. It's not so easy cleaning up after me.
Yes, Papa, name it. Name it. I'll do anything you say!
Never mind. You won't have to do anything for me ever again. I'm leaving!
Oh, thank you, sir.
Now calm yourself. Calm. What's the matter with you?
Why? What has happened?
Where?
Are you saying that someone is paying you to be our maid and doesn't want us to know who he is?
Wonderful!  He liked the monkey, didn't you?
Isn't he marvelous? He cost me a bundle, that horse, but he's worth it. I tell you, if you'd played Don Giovanni here it would have been a great success. I'm not joking. These people aren't fools. You could do something marvelous for them.
You won't be teaching this one either. She's my wife.
I'm afraid I am.
I'm sorry. No.
Love, Sire!
Herr Mozart, what brings you here?
So you are. How is your pretty wife?
Herr Sommer.
Look, I must have pupils. Without pupils I can't manage.
No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why.
Ah. Italian?
Two thousand, two hundred florins is all I need A hundred? Fifty?
It's the best opera yet written. I know it! Why didn't they come?
Yes?
What happened? Is it over?
You know, it's all here in my head. It's just ready to be set down. But when I'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus. I can't write.
So now the Confutatis. Confutatis Maledictis. When the wicked are confounded. Flammis acribus addictis. How would you translate that?
Do you believe in it?
A fire which never dies. Burning one forever?
That's wonderful!
I am so ashamed.
Is the Emperor angry with me?
No, but I'm the best.
Show them one interesting modulation and they faint. Ohime! Morbidezza! Morbidezza! Italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music!
Well done, Mozart. Really quite fine.
Well?
Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.
My son, why should you want all Vienna to believe you a murderer? Is that your penance? Is it?
Well, Mozart is already rehearsing.
Here I am, my angel.
I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish.
Now you've got to promise me faithfully you'll remain true to me forever. Then you'll see how tenderly your little birdie will love you.
This is embarrassing, you know. You introduced Mozart to some of my friends and he's begging from practically all of them. It has to stop.
Excuse me, sir, there is a lady who insists on talking to you.
You know, did he seem depressed? Do you think he'll eat the food?
Yes.
Yes.
You've absolutely no idea where David might be?
Surely you're not suggesting...
He's here.
Could you get here without any trouble?
You haven't eaten your lunch.
You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler.
This is absurd. I'm not hungry. I don't want any food.
You're a very beautiful girl.
Do you like it?
How old are you?
David, your dreams will stop. You'll leave England and your bad memories; and then this will all fade away.
How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient?
I'm a werewolf.
Bathroom.
Listen, if you get too anxious, call me at the hospital, okay?
I've left those pills for you.
Alex, I've lost my mind. I woke up at the zoo! But you know what? I feel terrific!
Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?
Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.
David, what are you doing?
Sir, he's very upset. His friend was killed and...
How are we feeling tonight?
Benjamin, have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck?
He all right?
Now see here young man.
Why are you doing this to me, Jack?
Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you.
An American film about the Mafia called 'See You Next Wednesday', and I want to see it badly, so you give me no problems and go to sleep.
Some, everyone does.
I have to make love to her. It's very simple. She has no choice really.
It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.
That's not a spear. It's a pike.
David, before we go in there I want you to know that - no matter what happens to us - it's your fault.
Hello.
Right.
Come on, Jack, shall we go?!!
That was weird. I guess leaving was the best idea.
What do you think was wrong?
No, but he was on the moors.
I vote we go back to The Slaughtered Lamb.
It's moving.
What's the plan?
Nice doggie. Good boy.
Where are we going?
You really scared me, you shithead.
Thanks a lot.
David! You're hurting my feelings.
Debbie Klein cried a lot.
So you know what she does? She's so grief stricken she runs to find solace in Rudy Levine's bed.
What?!
It's you, David.
Beware the moon. The full moon, David. You've got two days.
Listen to me! Take your own life, David. It's our only chance.
You're not real.
What, Jack? That tomorrow night beneath the full moon I'll sprout hair and fangs and eat people? Bullshit!
Hi, Jack.
David Kessler, this is Gerald Bringsly.
No, thank you, Doctor.
Yes?
No, thank you.
He has?
Let me have ten bucks?
Say pal, did you ever hear of a Depression?
What's the matter, Charlie?
I remember once when your account checked.
What good will that do?
What's the matter with my policy? How many losses has this bank taken in the last twenty-five years?  I'll tell you. Not a single one!  What's wrong with that kind of banking?
We want to talk to you.
The depositors you were protecting were the first ones to pounce on you. You thought they were your friends. Why don't you go out there now and try and get some help from them?
Say, you can't do that
Come out here you pawnbrokers - take a look at this!
Where were you at twelve o'clock last night?
That is simple, isn't it? I assume you can prove that if necessary.
Looks like you're going to have no trouble at all. What was the lady's name, Mr. Cluett?
Oh!
Stand back Inspector, or I'll shoot. Drop that gun.
Why, I couldn't do that . . . !
running around. Not your work.  You'd better start reforming, Cyril!
Doesn't that come next?
But I'm giving a party for him - a real, old-fashioned surprise party. Caps, bells, whistles, and everything. I'm really terribly excited about it. I've been planning it for months.
Why are you so anxious?
Well, I thought I'd like to have a little talk with you.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson. My wife is much better this morning.
Now Tom, you simply cannot go to Philadelphia tonight. That's all there is to it.
The theatre?
Got my letter?
Mr. Dickson?
You haven't got a uniform?
Oh, make that uniform blue.
Well, I
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.  Matt, do you realize you're up against something? You're being charged with murder. It's serious, son. Now come on, I know you didn't do it.  But we've got to make them believe it. Come on, tell the truth, where were you last night?
Maybe. But I'm taking no chances.  Why, this kid's got a record.
You're lying!
The lobby's half filled now.
Look at them, Mr. Dickson. They're going crazy.
He's at a board meeting.
What happened? What did he say? Did you get the job?
Now you've got me worried, dear.  Promise me you won't butt in.
Oh, Matt . . .
What's he doing, honey? Is he getting any help?
They must have turned him down.
No. It wasn't earlier because...
Sit down! When the watchman surprised you, you shot him - what'd you do with the gun?
What time did you get in?
But I wasn't here, Mr. Dickson. Honest I wasn't . . .
Everybody in?
Certainly, Mr. Jones! Certainly! Charlie!
I couldn't lose him.
This is the best score yet.
How'd they --
I ain't done --
Cole, I want to get to the farm, make sure Little Jim and the girls are okay.
Damn!
Okay, folks, I think we know how this is going to go...
Beg pardon?
The things a fella has to do to get a little respect around here...
Listen, he's my brother and I don't want to start trouble...
What?
You shut up now, boy.
It'll be the biggest score yet.
What are you saying?
And almost got hanged in peacetime.
Tom, why don't you stop at our spread before you head on out to the reservation? Figure we might have some work for you, if you want.
What the --
I think one of 'em's glass.
Oh, Lord, the dance hall girl at Bunty's...
Hey! We decide something, that's it! We're in this for the long haul, and this idea of me and Jesse's will help give us more places to hide out without worrying about some farmer with a shotgun sneakin' up on us in our sleep. We've got to think --
Jesse.
He's going to be fine, right Daddy?
They're gone. What are you --
Distracting enough for you?
Web's dead.
Frank, don't you have something to say?
All we thought about was coming home. I swore I'd kill anybody who tried to get me off my farm again. If I have to go to war with the railroad to stay, fine by me.
I went up to the courthouse and looked at the right of way documents for the rail bed. The railroad doesn't even need our land, they're just taking the land on both sides for as far as they can.
You ready to stop loafing around with this young lady and get back to farming?
You're looking a bit more spry now that somebody --
Pinkertons. It's the railroad.
Didn't think you would.  I'm going to go make the coffin.
Gents, we are in the middle of something here.
This has been a good year.
You're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know.
I'll meet you down there in a few weeks.
Did you kill Yankees?
Ma, I'm glad to see you being nice to our Injun friend.
Jesse, are you awake?
Jesse, is that your hand?
Teasing you is completely unfair.
So you're saying I should leave you alone and go spend time with Jimmy Younger?
I used to come to this tree when I was a kid and imagine what my life would be like when I got older.
Ahem. "From this doctrine..." No, ah... "From women's eyes this doctrine I derive, they sparkle still like ... shiny... sparkling rocks..."
You and I, we've started... something, you know?  I don't know what'll happen if you do this.
I would never have imagined us in a place like this.
Hmm.
Now, sweetie, y'all wouldn't go believing one of them silly dime novels, would you?
Don't turn around.
Don't swear.
Tennessee?
Did you order our houses burned down?
Mmm.
Yes?
Was it worth it?
That's what I would have done.
The railroad has no business in Tennessee. Therefore I have no interest in the state of Tennessee.
And you're too young.
Hell yeah! I been with...  Uh, not exactly. It's just, I don't want to get one of these paid ladies, you know?
... too young for whisky...
Jesse, you explain to Lyla. My girl, you know, from that time...
Devereux. My brother Cole dated a European girl once.
My professional opinion is that you have managed to piss off the wrong bunch of farm boys this time.
How can that be?
Just perfect.
To be precise, they didn't blow up the tracks.
The final route for the railroad is complete.
How did you know?
You wouldn't have done that?
This is no game.
Hardly farmers. I've done some checking. All these were in the War. These men know sabotage, tactics, and have four years of bloody fighting experience behind them. They are disciplined, well-trained and have a charismatic leader. If I were to design the perfect outlaw band, this gang is what I would create.
First of all: you, shut up.  Now, you've given me a thousand miles of railroad to cover. Every time the James Gang strikes, we shift a hundred detectives to that area. But there's just too much open land, too many riverbeds to ride, caves to hide in. This gang operates across four states, often riding a hundred miles between jobs.
What the hell is that sound?
Listen, what are you doing tonight?
Yes?
I can't.
Pick me up?
Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.
Pull out, goddamnit!
It's a plain end, see? So?
I haven't seen you around here.
Nothing like last time, promise.
Really?
Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly.
Pat, this is my cousin Vanden and her boyfriend Stash. He's an artist.
Your hairline looks like it's receding.
We need to talk.
You're really serious, aren't you?
But what about the past? Our past?
You'll notice that my friends and I all look and behave in a remarkably similar fashion, but there are subtle differences between us. McDermott is the biggest asshole. Van Patten is the yes man. Price is the most wired. I'm the best looking. We all have light tans. Right now I'm in a bad mood because this is not a good table, and Van Patten keeps asking dumb, obvious questions about how to dress .
Listen, what about dinner?
Are you my two o'clock?
Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must...
Call me please, Patrick.
SHUT UP!
Raised lettering, pale nimbus white...
Dorsia.
Marcus Halberstam. For two at eight?
After six.
Oh? And what should I say?
Anywhere you want?
Soooo...Dorsia is where Jean wants to go...
Want a bite?
Do you have a boyfriend?
Did you know that Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie, was named Lassie? Had you heard this?
Patrick Bateman's office.
Where are you?
Just...say...no!
Well...
Hi, Patrick. I thought that was you.
Did you know that guy who disappeared? Didn't he work at Pierce & Pierce, too? Was he a friend of yours?
Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive?
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.
Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL
So, what's the topic of discussion?
Coffee?
Perrier? San Pellegrino?
You sure?
Yeah...Yale thing.
He had a yacht?
So was I.
Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert Ainsworth for Paul, so...
Nothing.
The earth just opens up and swallows people.
So...you hang out here a lot?
Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.
I mean they want to get caught.
I had a date with a girl named Veronica.
Well, I could he wrong.
Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information?
No hash browns?
According to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam.
Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't be sure.
Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you?
I'm so hungry.
Listen, what's your name?
Hello, Halberstam. Nice tie. How the hell are you?
How's the Ransom account going, Marcus?
No, man. I'm gonna bail.
Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?
I just don't see how someone, anyone, can appear that way and yet be involved in such total shit. How can you be so fucking, I don't know, cool about it?
It's important.
When's Brian coming for the TV?
What're you -- what?
I can't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that.
It isn't a broadcast studio. It's -- a surveillance post or something. That's why they have the dishes on top.
It's the only one with dishes on the roof. The studio's a front. That's why they keep postponing its opening.  ...gotta get in there.
I can't just walk away!
It's almost nine, I've been so worried!  What did you see in there?
Lisa's an extremely valuable member of the Skywire team. We've got our eyes on her. You keep yours on Milo.
Don't worry, Milo. I'm here as a friend. Or maybe a supplicant.
Yes sir. I need to talk to you.
My goodness.
Let me look into it, see what's being done. Frankly, it's not my area.
Well I parked illegally. See y'later?
Stigma? Larry! 60 billion buys you some slack in this world.
Milo? I'm Danny.
...Hello?
I've only shown this to three other people. I bought 200, we've launched 12 so far. I keep the coordinates in this room.  It's left over from SDI. Reagan's Star Wars technology? They orbit 426 miles up.
No! Just waiting for my counselor to come by and introduce himself.
Somebody said I'm just another Philistine. With reproductions.
It's okay. Really.
You did this -- overnight?
Milo. What's up?
You really wrote this just today?
Everything I do is under scrutiny. The questions they ask, trying to make anything strategic look sordid.  I'm confused. Doesn't everybody in business try to get ahead?
I meant did you find other stuff to --
You've been coming in early.
I'm okay. It's going well!
Why did you move around so much? When you were a kid.
That's great! Thanks.
Gary, I --
I hope you know what you mean to me. Not just because of what you're doing. Because of who you are.
I think you should go.
I know you lost all his work. Maybe I could come down here and --
Delbert seems to enter #21 twice. Without leaving the first time.
Get the backslash, the colon, keys kids don't use but geeks do.  What would Milo want in here, anyway?
Now what are we doing? I don't get any of this shit!
I'm getting a teacher's pet rep.
They just pushed up the schedule on Skywire apps. How fast are you going?
Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people.
You thought about it too. You've been suspicious for a while. But it's not happening in there. It's happening in the Day Care.
It's easy to know who the smart geeks are, the schools tell 'em. They upload medical files, school records, pharmacy files. They'd be happy just to steal code forever. But when a program gets close to fruition. Like Teddy. He was almost there.
He's out of prison?
Who can we trust?
We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home.
Yeah, they dig stuff like this.  "CBS News has partnered with Outpost Information Systems in a cable news network due to launch Fall of 2001."
How close are you?
I don't know --
I told Teddy about you.
Oh.
Same with the excerpts I'm choosing: they'll play against any of the images you described.
You could always say you have to go the bathroom.
Why?!
They know, I had no choice. Get out of the house now! Do you have a laptop?
...He knows.
We rented a loft in Sunnyvale.  You know what's the bad part? We can't talk about work anymore. We're competitors! The venture capitalists made us sign like 100 confidentiality forms.
I'm cool. They didn't touch the machine. Or my disks. Probably didn't know what they were. So, you a Moonie yet?  Milo?
What? Come on. Is it serious?
A beautiful geek? I don't wanna sound paranoid, or like a pig, but what're the chances?
So -- how far are we from the campus?
So how'd you like the house?
Heavy graphical background, doing design-interface for Skywire apps.  You'll be working with her.
Gary's not into fiber optics. He's betting everything on the satellites.
Did you download Corey? In San Jose?
Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you Alotta...  Please?
In Japan, men come first and women come second.
Care for some saki?
How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham?
Yes.
Hungry.
I just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows what's going on at any given time. We've just received word that Dr. Evil, the ultimate square, is planning to take over the world.
Yes?
Vanessa's one of our top agents.
Hello, Austin, this is Basil Exposition from British Intelligence. Thank you for confirming the link between Dr. Evil and Virtucon. Find out what part Virtucon plays in something called Project Vulcan. I'll need you and Vanessa to get on that immediately.
She's working on another lead right now.
Yes?
Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle.  I've uncovered the details on Project Vulcan. It's a new subterranean warhead delivery system.
I'm leaving!  Oh, and Austin?
Good afternoon, Mr. Powers, I'm the Destructacon 5000. I'm programmed to prevent you from progressing beyond this point. You might as well surrender. Resistance is futile. Your odds of survival are 23,763,273 to...
I'm sorry, baby, I'm just not grocking your head space.
I've got you, Dr. Evil!
My mother's told me all about you.
Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh? How does a hot chick like you end up working at the Ministry of Defense?
That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag?
Brrrr! She must be frigid. There's two things I know about life: one, Americans will never take to soccer. Two, Swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag!  They're shag-mad, man! Let me ask you a question, Vanessa, and be honest.
You've preserved my Jag! Smashing!
Let's go get him!
Always wanting to have fun, that's you in a nutshell.
Thank God, Austin, we made it.
That's not the way to get ahead in life.
Kiss me.
It says here, name Danger Powers.
OK, Austin Danger Powers: One blue crushed-velvet suit. One frilly lace cravat. One gold medallion with peace symbol. One pair of Italian shoes. One pair of tie-dyed socks, purple. One vinyl recording album: Tom Jones, Live at Las Vegas. One Swedish-made penis enlarger pump.
One credit card receipt for Swedish- made penis enlarger pump, signed Austin Powers.
Hi, folks. You're entering a restricted zone. Can I see your security badges?
Everything seems to be in order.
We could not anticipate feline complications due to the reanimation process&emdash;
Breathtaking, Frau. These automated strumpets are the perfect bait for the degenerate Powers.
Quite impressive.
Actually, the boy's quite astute. I am trying to kill him. My Evil Associates have cautioned against it, so here he is, unfortunately, alive.
But Scott, who's going to take over the world when I die?
In due time.
What did you say?
Umm, that also has already happened.
We don't judge here.
We don't label people here, Scott.
Of course. Natural weather delivered to your door on demand. Down your phoneline. For limited periods.
As real as you wish. Hot or cold. Humid or dry. Anything you like. Within reason.
The technology is brand new. Soon it will be more powerful. We anticipate a huge demand. Leave us your number. We'll be in touch.
I want you to say the first thing that comes into your head when I say these words. Do you understand ... ?  Blue ...
Knight ...
Nature ...
How long have I been here?
I've come to apply for membership in Brolly --
May I help you, madam ...
London. The World Council of Ministers meets soon on global defence. If you can control the weather, you control the world.
Peter Peel was a first class agent. A senior operative. 'X' department Special operations. He was engaged in top secret research. Top priority.  Government approved.
I was about to throw in the towel.
Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think?
Congratulations, you've penetrated a bastion of male privilege. I guessed you weren't a stickler for Tradition, doctor.
I say, this is all terribly formal. Must I go an calling you Dr. Peel?
And I suppose you're the knight.
Sir August Merryweather ... why are we seeing him first?
The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined.
I wasn't about to.
But that's absurd. I may not be over-fond of you, Steed, but it's not my style.
That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised.
An invitation. To a 'formal picnic'...?
I must say, you look more your old self --
Elementary, Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw isn't the only shoemaker still practicing his trade ...
For you, Mrs. Peel.
Not that I know of.  Explanation?
Do you always drive this fast?
Someone didn't want us to get to the party.
Steed ... !
You followed me.
To kill me?
His name's Jones. 'Invisible' Jones.
Trubshaw again? What now?
They're playing your song, Mrs. Peel.
Oh, and by the way, I think it's about time you got rid of that chip on your shoulder.
Our chaperon.
Your mission is simple. Find out how and why these agents died.
Ah, here we are. Steed asked me to play a hunch:  Valentine Peel.
Do you also know that during your final experiment, your halfbrother- in-law was under surveillance?
The World Council of Ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative --
Under the circumstances Mother didn't see fit, but I think I can get you in ...
'X' marks the spot. The shoes were delivered to ... an island in Hyde Park. Surrounded by the Serpentine. On the site of a former Ministry installation...
Oh, hello ...
You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ...
Insane ... ?
We had a lead to Wonderland Weather but we got there too late. Someone tipped them off ...
Pity. I was growing fond of Mrs. Peel. Unfortunately --
In your operation.
I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be on your way. Mrs. Peel with you?
You with Mother or Father?
Mrs. Peel -- ?
Does Cole know about this?
I'm totally blown away. You're getting married. It seems like only yesterday I showed you how to have oral sex.
He still thinks I'm going with him. I'm going to break the news to him tomorrow.
I'm glad you guys came by... What's the occasion?
Yes, gentlemen. Saturday after next, I lose my amateur standing and turn pro.
All right!
And...
Thanks, Dad.  Cole, go away.
Low mileage... Handles like a dream.
Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's gone!
Rick... Debbie is mine. She'll always be.
Nice shot.
Take hold of yourself. What room are they in?
Cole, we've got to talk.
That's all right, Deb. Go be happy and smile a lot, Deb. Do it for me.
Yes, but looks are deceiving...  Not in this case, however.
Um... that's very relaxing.
This is it, lady. Last stop.
Don't turn on the lights, sugar.  I'll lead you around.
I don't believe you.
See? And these are not just ordinary party-goers -- there are professionals in this crowd -- I didn't want any of them. You... You're what I want. Understand?
That doesn't mean it was Rick's party.
Jumbo, where the hell are the women?
This is bad public relations. I was planning to do a lot of business with you. But now I'm going to have to go elsewhere.
Sounds swell... I'm really touched. And my getting married's not gonna change a thing between me and my pals. We're still gonna go bowling on Tuesdays, play cards on Fridays and wear women's clothes on Sunday night. I love you guys... I always will.
It's true.
You want to share it?
My marriage is the worst. All crap. A big pile of shit.
She hates me. It's over. You'll see, as soon as you get married, everything changes. You sure you want to go through with it, man?
Guys, I think I'd rather stay here.
I just want to be alone.
What the hell are you doing?
You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?
It's my fault. He's dead because... I left those drugs...
Well, I have to admit my game's a little rusty, but I love polo. It's unrelenting, a constant challenge to the senses. Really a beautiful experience.
Ebbie. Ger... umph... lable...
The thought of that person marrying my daughter makes me want to upchuck.
Where the hell is he?
What's the matter?
What the hell is that?
Right in there, pal.
How'd it go?
Who was that?
What's this?
He look familiar?
How about this, a Trojan donkey.
Reach out and snort someone.
Guess who's here? Another surprise guest.
You're late again, Rick.
Sister, do you ever get lonely after vespers? If you do, why don't you give me a call. I'm in the book.
How the hell are we supposed to get this donkey inside?
Goddamn it, Stephen, lay off!  You stupid dumbshit, you never know when to fucking quit, do you? You ever wonder why your career's in the fucking toilet? Why you're gonna be stuck a Lt. for life?
Adcox, go with Pengelly and check the other side.
You stupid son of a bitch! What the fuck are you doing!
Ah, everybody screws up some, Brian. You're working for the toughest Lt. on the job. Saw him once pick up a probie he thought was moving too slow and throw him into a burning building. It's just bad luck you're family.
Doesn't work on you.  See ya around, little brother.
In the Field Museum once.
Sheep don't count.
Goddamn it Stephen!
So you got a 'roid going with Jackson or what?
Roll the hose.
You okay?
-- What were they doing there?
You're his Lt., Stephen...  Are you gonna handle it? Are you Stephen?
Huh.
With grenadine, right?
Brian, do you always have to be so stupid? Think about your future for once.
Look, I didn't mean to take a piece out of you back there, I just thought you'd call when you came back. You didn't and...  Don't blow it just because of this garbage between us.
I've been thinking about what you said the other night... If the offer's still on the table, I'd like to talk about it.
If you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, I'd probably be pissed.  Boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes...
Will you please keep your voice down, there's people --
What'll you do?
Brian McCaffrey...  Oh this is really a treat. Brian McCaffrey. Lost a dad to the animal, huh?
Your first question should be who isn't. It isn't a spark, Brian. Not enough damage. And an insurance pro? Where's the profit margin?
-- No no, your turn. Tell me a story.
Famous story even. Straight burn. Just an engine and truck first on scene. What did you feel, Brian, when you first got there?
That's a probie answer. You're smarter than that, Brian.
I need another one, sir.
Uh, I don't think that's in my contract...
-- Go to the bottom. Under heat properties.
But he could have killed everybody there. The firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall. The backdraft blew out the flame. That's it. That's the reason.
Why backdrafts. Whoever fried Seagrave and Cosgrove went to a helluva lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire, but also made sure the fire blew itself out.
Nice bunch of guys.
Another couple of good men get burned up for their city? Is that how it's going to read?  You're the only one that knows.
Brian?
Four months?
Yeah. Big fan.
Man. Something sure put a crimp in his evening.
So, you surviving without me?
Uh huh. And "Pioneer's Pride, Mobile Log Cabins". That was in your blood about six months wasn't it?
"Laguna Jamming, Custom Surfboards"?
And just this year, "Brian's Sound Spectrum". Your own company even. Big step.
I hate it when we gotta fucking go look for it.
Stephen, what are you doing here?
Where's Sean?
Yeah... I just thought I should say, I don't know, something.
Ah Stephen, that's what this is really about, isn't it? You always have to be right.
-- He's gettin' good on those eggs. And y'know, he told me he actually likes the piano.
Shadow.
Didn't think you'd make it.
Ronald here likes telephones. Used to tape wooden matches to the bell striker and wrap it in cotton. Came up with a whole little thing there, didn't you Ronald? When you got bored, what did you do? You just started making calls... mostly day care centers and retirement homes, wasn't it?
Is there a connection between them, Alderman?
Mr. Swayzak! How ya doin'?
I'm gonna need some bread, man. This ain't fair. I'm always here for you, and you can't even take decent care of me. My landlord is bitching like a motherfucker! You're two months behind on the rent, Lieutenant!
It's horrible. They burned her breasts with cigarettes. Christ.
Yeah.
It's not the drugs, Ariane, it's -- it's someone who wants to kill me.  You gotta believe me!
So what are you doing here?
That stuff'll kill you quick, man.
The rich kind.  Jeez, man. The way you smoke that shit is suicide.
I forgive you.
It's still my money. If you want to have a chance at any part of it, shithead, you will take my $120,000 and bet on tomorrow's game.
I want 15 on the Mets.
OK asshole. You owe thirty grand. Now what are you gonna do?
Take your money? This guy will blow up your house and everyone in it!
You do know that he's gonna blow up your house, kill your wife and kids --
BLAK OUT.  BLAK LISTED.  BLAK BALL. Need I say more.
...Benedict Arnold...
Everybody say Ho!
My name is Honeycutt and I want to try something different.  Can you do this for me?
C'mon.  It's easy.  It's the same thing y'all do out at the Yankee game, no different 'cept we changing one word.  Everybody go it?
Alright.  Here we go.  Let's go NIGGERS!  LET'S GO NIGGERS!
Well you did.
We're ready when you are.
Certified ladies' man, huh?
I'm out.
Good morning, Cheeba.
If it's not too much trouble could you order us some food?
That ain't funny.
I would like to change your name.
You're now Mantan.
Mantan?
I'm always gonna be that.  But I ain't doing no more buck dancing.
Our guest today is Pierre Delacroix. He is the creator of the highly controversial TV show MANTAN. Let's get right into it.  You have been called by some in the community a traitor, a sellout, an Uncle Tom. Why does your show generate such feelings?
...exactly thirty-two minutes ago.
I'm sorry about my blowup but I have to have a whipping boy every meeting.
I understand Black culture.  I grew up around black people all my life. If the truth be told I probably know "niggers" better than you, Monsieur Delacroix.  Please don't get offended by my use of the quote-unquote N word.  I got a black wife and three bi-racial children, so I feel I have a right to use that word.  I don't give a damn what Spike says, Tarantino is right.  Nigger is just a word.  If Dirty Ole Bastard can use it every other word so can I.
What is it you want from me?  Some plantation follies?  Some sitcom that takes place on a watermelon patch?  Some show that follows four nigger generations of junkies and crackheads?  You want me to go back to the ante bellum days?
Don't worry about that, that's my department.  Now who do we cast? We need a star.  Can Whoopi sing or dance?
That's a great handle.
Negroes would be in an uproar.
I strongly feel that a Negro should direct this.  This kind of satire is a high wire act in a gale storm. One misstep and we're doing "Amos and Andy."  Only a Negro will have the sensitivity and cultural awareness to navigate this dangerous terrain.
You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?
In the immortal words of Derrick Coleman, WHOOOPDEEDAMNDOO!!!
I don't give a good goddamn about Finland, Norway, Sweden or wherever ya blond ass came from.
Yo, DeLa, I just got the news from the CNS brass.  They saw some clips from the pilot and they're rushing it onto the air.  Yo, we're a midseason replacement, ordered 12 shows.  We're on in 3 weeks.  Didya hear what I just said, Yo?
Hold on a sec, I got a call.
Son.  Good to seeya.  Good to seeya.
Pull up a chair.  Oh, excuse me, this is my lady DOT.
I did.  I'm not an alcoholic.  I just like to drink.
The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle.
I love you too, Daddy.
So what's up with you?
Manray was under our nose the whole time.
Sounds risky to me.
I'm in till the end.
Can't you just quit?  Walk away?
What is your problem?
Even if money wasn't an issue, Dunwitty will still go ahead without me and that could be more dangerous.
Good morning, for those of you who don't know me, I'm Pierre Delacroix. I'm running things and this here is my assistant Sloan Hopkins.
You've said that already.
We both lied to him.
Who's side are you on?
How so?
That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.
Otherwise.  I trust you know the difference.  You're an intelligent woman, finished at NYU.
That's the way it came out.  Let me ask you one question.  Have you ever been in want, in need your entire privileged life?
Can I kiss you too?
Not nervous?  Relaxed?
You getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing?
You shouldn't even be mad at me over Sloan.
Let me ask you a question, if I may. How do you think she got the job in the first place?  I don't mean to burst your bubble, Mantan the Marvelous, but Sloan is an opportunity.
Mantan, we got a show to tape.
You must think I'm some kind of fool.
I know what's on my birth certificate.  You heard from Daddy?
To answer your question, there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons?
He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia.
Of course I'm happy for you. You've worked very hard for your success.
How did you get this gig?
Not a class, not a thing, just picked stuff up by myself.
You sing and dance?
If that was suppose to be a compliment, I thank you.
Money and nothing else?
No, not that.  How 'bout...
You're sure this is a good idea.
What?
How did you get this gig?
Oh, you gonna make me say it.
I know I won't be your puppet.
Where are you bound for?
Both of us ride home with Best here.
There's nothing else for it.  Take your ground, Grogan -- twelve paces, I suppose?
Hoity-toity!  John Best, what's the matter here?
Well, well!  What is it?  We'll make you used to our ways, or adopt English ones.
O'Grady.
Ah!  You sly rogue, I see that will influence you.
Good morning, Private James.  Please come in.  I should like you to meet my uncle, Herr Minister of Police Galgenstein.
You say he drives after breakfast and before dinner.  When he comes out to his carriage a couple of gendarmes will mount the box, and the coachman will get his orders to move on.
I hope to spoil this sport, and trust to see this sword of mine in that big bully's body.
I'll match any man with the sword.
I see you are thinking of a certain young lady at Duganstown.
Chevalier, though I cannot say how, I believe you have cheated me.
I don't know.
I believe they will deport you.
Gentlemen, I wish you a good day. Will you please go to the house from whence we set out this morning, and tell my man there to send my baggage on to Three Kings at Dresden?
I entered here, monsieur, at a bad moment for you; it seems that you love this lady.
No.
Not one.
Your word "empty" makes me laugh. Is it fortunate, or unfortunate?  If it is fortunate, I congratulate myself.  If it is unfortunate, I do not care, for I am not aware of it.
Poor man.  And, for that reason, you want to begin where people end?
Let us give each other complete happiness, and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires, they will each time be born anew.
Without you, my dearest, I might have died without ever knowing love. Inexpressible love!  God of nature! Bitterness than which nothing is sweeter, sweetness than which nothing is more bitter.  Divine monster which can only be defined by paradoxes.
My Lady Cosgrove's relationship with me was a singular one.  Her life was passed in a series of crack-brained sort of alternation between love and hatred for me.  We would quarrel for a fortnight, then we should be friends for a month together sometimes.  One day, I was joking her, and asking her whether she would take the water again, whether she had found another lover, and so forth.  She suddenly burst out into tears, and, after a while, said to me:
If ever I meet him again, you shall see which is the best man of the two.  I'll fight him with sword or with pistol, captain as he is.
Suppose, now, Roderick, you, who are such a hero, was passing over the bridge and the enemy on the other side.
What, with me on the pillion?  Would you kill poor me?
Monster!  Your father was a tailor, and you are always thinking of the shop.  But I'll have my revenge, I will!  Roddy, will you see me insulted?
Last month, the Duke of Suffolk spent no more.
By name only.
Did you buy the horse, papa?
Yes, he's fine.
Sir William Cosgrove, with his complication of ills, was dying before us by inches.  He was continually tinkered up by doctors, and, what with my usual luck, he might be restored to health and live I don't know how many years.  If Cosgrove would not die, where was the use of my pursing his lady?  But my fears were to prove groundless, for on that very night, patient nature would claim her account.
Charming Schuvaloff.
A target, Kendall, cap a fucking target. What's wrong with you?
Fuck, what the fuck is going on --
What about Pike?
He is the only one unaccounted for.
You killed him you fucking faggot --
West was one thing, but this --
Yeah, right...
You too?
There's no need...
That'd be my reaction too --
Fuck "you're serious", Raymond, you got exactly zero truck with us; right now we'd take the word of a crackhead over yours, so if you've got something to say, say it.
And he'd been shot.
You shot Childs and Nunez.
Raymond, for you to have any chance of coming out of this, we need to locate the other bodies and examine them to corroborate your testimony. Otherwise this is just another story --
He -- He made me do it --
Back up.
Dunbar you are to stand here and guard this nigger for the next twenty- four hours! He is not to be given food, water, or clothes! If he so much as moves, you are to blow his nigger brains out, is that clear?
Pike and I got separated... then I heard gunfire. Close.
What do you mean, West's?
Roberto, what the fuck?
Mueller.
You hated West, Mueller loved him --
I... I don't know...
That's it. You're that policeman with friends in low places. Tell me, how's Guissepe Torres doing these days? Those racketeering indictments must have really been a downer --
Is it the truth?
I believe your next line is "What are you trying to hide?"
Something funny, Levi?
Why?
Or you, Levi? When is it finally going to come out that you were the one who killed him?
What I said before --
They're taking your command, aren't they?
Toxicology report came back. Kendall's attack was caused by a drug known as anephadrine, maybe you've heard of it. It's for asthmatics. If an epileptic takes enough, it kills them. I checked with the nurses at the hospital -- you're the only other person who visited Kendall.
Hostile and uncooperative.
I didn't mean that as a compliment.
Three things. First -- You don't have a choice. Second -- I've never taken a bribe in my life. And Third -- I'm still a little drunk from last night, so if I skip over the witty banter and move forward to straight hitting on you, try not to take offense. Tell me about the two guys.
Levi? Who names their kid Levi --
The Colonel saw you shoot Nunez, you're a murderer --
We're in the middle of a murder case --
Something like that. You?
This is the straight hitting on me you were talking about, isn't it?
You're off to a late start.
He's telling the truth, up to a point.
Remember, he's the son of a Senator, so go easy. Kid gloves.
That was kid gloves?
But we have to question him --  Thought you didn't have cigarettes --
Why the fuck wasn't he in restraints?
At least you and Kendall agree on that.
What?
That's a fantastic idea --
You wanted to break him.
So what now?
Nah.
A word of advice about women -- that first hour or so after they kill their boss? Probably not the best time to hit on them.
Your phone number?
He said what?
No one else heard it?
Nunez was chasing Dunbar.
Pike never confessed.
It won't work --
Who, Levi --
Whoever shot the Sarge blew a grenade first --
I used it to start the fire --
Cadet Michael Mueller, I hereby place you under military arrest for the murder of Sergeant Nathan West --
This is totally unnecessary --
You want Kendall, don't you?
You never told me why you got kicked out of...
Some of you may have heard there's a hurricane coming! American soldiers do not wait for good weather -- they do not wait for a bright sunshiney day to do their duty! An American Soldier learns to operate in the worst conditions and turn said conditions into an advantage against their enemy! Anyone who thinks these conditions are too harsh, feel free to lay down and die, you get me?
See! The big guy likes it.
Fine, you do it.
Bloom!
Glad to see you're not trying to have a heartfelt talk. It's one of my greatest annoyances, when people talk to those who can't hear them.
Not that one. The real story. Did he ever tell you that?
I'm eight. That means when I'm eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38.
How are you gonna make it without your shoes?
So I've heard.
Lord, I'm sorry I...
Don't. Don't be embarrassed. I should never have let you think that...  I am in love with my wife.
You don't need a picture. Just look up handsome in the dictionary.
Is it the medicine that's making you thirsty?
The one about the witch.
And every day I gave him a quarter. Every day. Then I got sick and was out for a couple of weeks. And when I went back there, you know what he said?
You owe me three-fifty.
Your mother hasn't been keeping up the pool. If you wanted to you could...
You know where the chemicals are?
Why not religion, Dad?
The thing about icebergs is you only see 10 percent of them. The other 90 percent is below the water where you can't see it. And that's what it is with you Dad. I'm only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water.
The river.
Let's get out of here.
You become what you always were. A very big fish.  And that's the way it happens.
This is why you don't show work in progress.
Are you Jenny Hill?
Can I ask you a question? Why did you come here today? If you found this deed, why didn't you just ask Eddie?
You didn't become crazy.
I'm going to get started on dishes.
I'm going with you.
You never told me how your parents met.
What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that.
Do you love your father?
Mom, would you say you understand Dad?
Would you say you understand Josephine?
Mom?
Mom, do you want some time with Dad?
Put it in the cases. Split it up. And don't forget you owe me £150.
Yeah it was okay.
The sets were good.
Yes.
That's not a burn.
A baby? What are we supposed to do with a baby?
What. You're what? You're with this creep now.
This is sensitive. Your car. Lovely car. Doesn't necessarily give the right impression.
To customers approaching the bank from the rear
Hello.
So how long will you be in England?
I...
I understand. I'm so sorry
I have brought you trouble. Maybe I should have come alone.
Put the fucking kettle down.
What did he say? Tell me!
I just can't find a nest. The root of the problem. I've looked everywhere. What's the Russian for ant? Sorry that's a stupid... Sorry. This is strange isn't it.
Do uh... Sorry. Can you follow me? Do you understand what I'm saying?
Uh... Are you a giraffe?
Today is bath day.
They go.
Unless. Unless this is part of the routine. You get tied up, stick around, distract me, they both bust in and Steal My Cup Of Coffee.
I don't want to know.
Why else would you send off for me? If you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute.
In the world.
What?
Excuse me?
And who says what is wrong.
It wasn't what I wanted.
You don't understand me.
What? I... I wasn't saying...
Fifteen. You don't know him. He was very kind and strong.
The rest of the world, John, it's not all like St. Albans.
Do you know if it's a boy or a girl?
Have you had any before?
I don't know.
You know you can come under the blanket.
Yeah. No thanks.
Something else.
Whatever.
It's not mine.
Is the flight full?
You have excellent English.
I bet you have loyal customers.
Been eatin' like a princess all week. Even got enough for us to take a picnic under the gazebo.
More cough syrup?
Mind I ask, what's all this business here?
For your hands?
Uh-uh. I's hitchin' up the interstate when I seen your truck outside.
Ronnie. You can't see cuz you're too close to it.  These nervous spells you get. You never had that shit back in school...
And then you had to fall in love with the school slut.
With all she was doin'. With all the shit she kept doing! You stayed stuck to that bitch's ass and you wouldn't let go.
It's not like I can't go out and have fun with my friends.
Jes? Jesse?  Oh shit... Wait... Wait... STOP!
I keep the heat on.
I deserve better than this.
Don't... don't say that to me...
Like a man.
You been in and out goin' on two... maybe two days.
Some crazy Jesus freak, gonna fuck the spirit into me...
I said... STOP!
Good. Now I got the steaks on, potatoes at a boil, and biscuits ready to pop in the oven. R.L. and Lincoln out yonder grillin' up the corn. What do you know how to make?
Could you do somethin' for me?
My life is gone. Only life I was livin'. And I lost it.
You took care of your wife, like you do me?
Laz? Can I sleep with you tonight?
I didn't mean it nothin' dirty.
I know that.
I don't want you to let go.
See, that girl is in my favor. You heard me, nigga? You fuck with her rough, and you got me to fuck wit.
You ever seen a train run on a woman?
That kind of talk is between us. Don't you go in there with that shit on your tongue.
I think you did alright by God under the circumstances.  Your people are here for you, Laz. This is your home. No shame in showing your face.
Was that Lincoln James I seen run off?
Mm. MM. Now these eggs got some kick to it. What'chu got in this?
Then what?
Yeah, you know you home, old man. You just walked through the door.
Keep the change on that.
Thank you.
You know how, like they say, you save someone's life, you responsible for them. Guess he just don't think it's safe for me.
You can't hurt people... and then just say, I'm sorry, and then everything just gets washed away. Why would heaven want people like that. People who... do what they want and then... switch.
This ain't gonna work.
I think if I just piss... I'll be okay.
No. I just got a messed up stomach.
I'm a what?
Ain't been a week and you already some nigger's whore? Gill told me. Told me how you and he... you and everybody...
No. That's not why...  Why we always gotta do this? I mean, you and me been at each other as far back as I can remember. Wasn't no love between us. And I'm your daughter. I'm the only family you got.
But... Momma... just tell me... not gonna be mad... we can just talk about it... Be eye to eye on this... You don't even got to say you're sorry... Just say how you knew...
I said we wasn't gonna talk about him.
Save that hustle talk to them field ballers you sell crack to.
He works for Frank Abolofia. Atlantic City.  Casinos.
What's this?
What are they doing now?
Some party.
What are you missing?  Riding your motorcycle to the nurse's house. That shit is sadder than Ethiopia.
Nick... You up?
This should be it...
Joyce can be nice.
You cool, Ich?
It's getting too cold even for me, Nick.
All right, how's the new partner?
... We got to keep looking.  Track him down!  Great balls of fire!
You know, Inspector, you take shit once, you take shit forever.
How'd you get this?
Did I say that?
Yakuza.
Nick, you can't do this.
Joyce?
You know, Nick, we can't lose.
Louder, pal, louder.
Ich said you left.
Bullshit, Nick.  And don't tell me this is all just about Charlie. It's not.
Keep the change.
Sugai won't give it to me, you know that.
You lost a man we wanted for some time.  It was very incompetent on your part, officer.
I want a gun.
If I say no?
We're not used to the big city. Where we come from it's not so easy to get lost.
Also you're too valuable to experiment with.
Oh, no bother, I'd be glad to.
What, Sebastian?
We have a lot in common.
You could help us.
He could?
The Tyrell Corporation has a demo model.  Check it out on the Voight-Kampff.  There's a chance the Nexus-6 is beyond out ability to detect.  If that's the case, everybody's up shit creek.
Well, when do you get paid?
Okay, but...
Not if it works.
Vodka!
Prosit.
How long you had these guys?
I'm great.  I mean, I know I'm not really great, but I feel just great.  How you like my new suit?
Don't make me laugh.  It makes me pee.
What's that?
Love is just another name for sex. Love is sexy and sex is lovely -- I don't care what you call it, an android can't have it.
What if you change your mind?
Why didn't you go?
It that mother real?
Me.
I wouldn't accept it.  Also, I'd report the person who gave it to me to the police.
You become pregnant by a man who runs off with your best friend, and you decide to get an abortion.
I can imagine.
They probably want to find out when they were made.
Where is he?
I don't know, I have nothing to compare it to.  I guess I thought there was something more to it.
I don't know... I think I missed something.
They could clean around the arrangement.
You're sick, Deckard.
Uh-huh.
Next time you go on vacation, do me a favor, let us know where it is.
Bad?
She didn't know?
How many questions does it usually take, Mr. Deckard?
Already had I.Q. test this year -- but I don't think I never had a...
What?
Doesn't make any difference what desert -- it's completely hypothetical.
Mine's J.F. Sebastian.
I'm hungry, J.F.
Oh, now, that's a great one!
Bravo!
I'm Nina Aron, Adam.
Very well, thank you. I'm with the County Family Services Department. Eve tells me you've been living in a bomb shelter most of your life.
My office.
But I do miss that green sport coat of yours.
Cliff, I must warn you. I know how to defend myself.
No.  I'm from out of town.  I'm here on business.
Where are we going?
No, I'm lost.
Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?
I came on a bus.
Nope.
Rogers Hornsby's worth like four thousand dollars!
I don't have to take a physical in your space ship?
It's Perry!
Hey, what are you doing?!
I knew this would happen!  You're like a lost puppy!
I think it's the eyes.
Watching television in color.
What?
Selling all my baseball cards. And helping me buy enough food and supplies to fill several large trucks.
Well, they're not starving yet, but they need help.
Well, another day, another dollar.  Stop staring at me!!
Pick you up at eight tomorrow morning.
Adam?  Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay?
Because I want to get married.
You almost got us killed!
I was wrong!!
I thought only hookers drank those things.
Yeah, right!  That's where you'd go to find girls!  Nome.  He's gay, by the way.
Where's he gone?
The what?
I certainly do!
No it's not!
Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend.
I thought I was here to meet women.
I like her.
Why?!  I think she's very attractive.
Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can't understand for the life of me why you would call her that!  Or why Cliff would say that about you.
What?
Why are you suddenly so mad at me?
I'm leaving, too.
I know...and I'm really sorry.
What?
Are you all right?
I've got to go, now.
Sure. Now, let's move on to our French exam.
En arte voluptus. Que les bons temps roulÈ!
What's baseball?
Like one of Mom's?
The nocturnal flying mammal?
Thank you, Mom! Thanks, Dad!
Helen-Thomas-Webber!  Maybe we have been down here a little too long!  Please excuse her French.
Adam...don't forget...don't forget ...
But, I don't understand.
What? Did the politburo just one day say - "We give up?"
This must be very new.
Yes. He likes windows.
Not on him.
Why not? He has great pants.
Okay, Troy!  Let's get those all-beef frozen patties!
Does that work?
Twenty-five? Around there.
The sky?  Where?
Come on. Frozen. How much are they?
Whatcha looking at?
I do alright.
How--how much do you want for the Mickey Mantle, rookie season?
I'm afraid you've got to.
This is your bedroom?
No.
You know, I don't think so. I'm confused but you know, I don't think he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd hurt anyone.
I was frightened and I didn't know what to think! But you know-I believe him. I think he just wants to go home. Wherever the hell that is...
All back East.
Good god.
You got a light, honey?
Well, put it down and come in!
You hear that?!
Calvin, I wish you would have at least let me do the dishes. It's not going to be that easy getting all that dried- on food off my nice plates.
How long will we have to stay down here?
What's that noise?
Hi, honey! Feeling better?
Burnt to a crisp.  I've given you the most well-done cut.
Maybe I've just got the creeps.
No.  I think it's just right.
Why?
Watch this!
Yes, you certainly will. And you'll find a nice girl and rebuild America. Just the way it used to be.
Get the presents and do the lights.
One who doesn't glow in the dark.
Yes.
Yes.
How long will you set it for this time?
I forgot some of my stuff.
You came back for these?
It means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men.
I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits.
I see "elegant."
Alright, I will.
Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's nothing personal.
He go back to the hotel?
To bed?
And I don't fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards!!
Or have perfect table manners.
Well, consider the source. I don't even know what a lady is.
So now I suppose he's trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible.
What are you going to do? Go over to her place and kick in the door?
I think it's important not to get depressed. Depression is a terrible thing. They say it can bring on illness.
Jeffrey, you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?
Doctor Gynde, my whole family's sick. What's going on?
Suave. Goddam are you suave, you fucker. You want some beer?
Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.
I guess you've seen some bad things.
You're all through with this now?
Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!!
Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. Hurry. I'm in the apartment. Hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.
The phone. What did you hear on the phone. Tell me. Word for word.
Don?
Yes.
No. What is happening?
Then don't talk about killing.
Don't say that.
Nice guy. Who's he?
No. But you're in very big trouble.
Come in.
Yes. Frank--
I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.
What do you want to do?
I want you to hurt me.
Okay. I know you've been scared. Now you want to scare someone.
I love you Don with all my heart.
I'm glad you do.
You called me Jeffrey.
Yes.
I'll call you.
What?
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
Who's this fuck?
Frank?
Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE THESE?
We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband?
Heineken.
Raymond! Where's the fuckin' beer?
What?
Would you like a piece of cake?
Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?
Sandy?... Sandy, please.
Well.
No, you're right.
Are you feeling okay?
Good to see you, son.
Oh yeah?
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
What do you know about the ear? Anything?
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
I owe you, since I goofed up this one.
I already know. The "Slow Club". It's on Route 7.
What's the plan.
Yeah, but.
I'm going to wait here until she comes.
What's with Mike?
I'm sorry, I didn't...
Wow. Should you tell my father?
I don't know. I had a dream. In fact, the night I met you.  In the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. You know, birds. Robins stood for love, and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. And it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess, until the robins come there is trouble.
You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.
You like mysteries that much?
You worry about me really?
Everything okay?
It's good to see you.
Mike's gotta go.  Nice to meet you.
Just for him?
Lord's name.
Are ya ready?
Look under the body.
Oh, God! Don't kill me! We're on the same side! The boss musta sent you in as back up, huh? Oh, shit, please! I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man.  They call me the funny fuckin' man!
You think they sold me out? No way.
I guess we really don't have a system of deciding who.
Let him go or I will deliver you, right now.
We're going to hit Poppa Joe tonight, right in the comfort of his own home. Then we move on to New York. It's getting a bit hot for us here.
I do believe the Monsignor finally got a point.
How many feminists does it take to screw in a light bulb?
Aaaww, shit!... evil woman!
"What do we tell him about the guns and money?"
How do you think he figured all this out without talking to us?
I have no idea. Maybe someone saw and talked.
Destroy all that which is evil...
Know what we need, man?... some rope.
Is that right, Rambo?
Where the fuck are you going?
He isn't to be touched.
We do not want your tired and sick.
Baumgartner sound Irish to you, fuck face?
And number three, Dolly.
They were wearing masks.
Maybe the three of them had something in common.
The shooter knew these guys, huh?
So what are you thinkin' here?
And the pennies?
The two bullets went in here, through the top of the skull, criss-crossed and exited through the eyeballs. This one clue tells us three distinct facts. Number one... Duffy.
Now stay with me, boys. What did they do to make two such identical wounds? Did one guy put him on his knees, pop a cap in, sit him back up and shoot him again the same way? No. Two men of similar height dropped this guy down, each put some iron to his head and boom! That's all she fuckin' wrote!
Jesus. I just can't think anymore. That scene over at the coffee shop today tapped me out.
A guy went nuts over off of Commonwealth today. Shot three guys to death in a coffee shop in broad daylight. Fled the scene. Don't have much on him.
Duffy. This look like a fucking post office to you? This guy came in here with intent. Maybe he didn't know exactly what he was gonna do but he had a pretty good idea. The bartender wasn't a fucking accident.
That's one big fuckin' shoe!... and think about it. Of all the ways to kill a guy, crushin' him to death. That's very particular. You don't get many of those. I dunno. I feel something big here. I wouldn't be surprised if we see more of these turning up.
While Greenly's getting coffee, anybody else want anything?
What if it was just one guy with six guns?
Roc. You okay?
Well, truth be known, those first ones just kinda fell into our laps.
Shit!... Shit! He ain't here.
I want to stand for what I believe in, father.
I wouldn't have, uh, killed you, Father.  Dominus Ominus. Remember, you're bound. You can't talk about this... to anyone.
Tell me a joke funny man. Hee Hee.
Plus where's Huggie Bear?
Why?
See, that's what I'm saying. It has the logic of a dream.
This is he?
That's true. But what if they change the locks?
Now that window can never be locked. It's impossible.
Anthony, we'll get two hundred for the coin collection alone. That's less than what it's appraised at.
Now. One thing we need to discuss is timing. Timing is absolutely crucial. What are you doing? Anthony!
Calm down. Take a deep breath.
What about what that guy said?
Can I get that credit card from you?
Yes, they are.
What about them?
What the fuck is going on here?
He needs to hire an attorney.
See, one day we were playing hot box over at my next door neighbor Mr. Langston's house and Anthony fell in the pool and got knocked unconscious. I had to dive in and save him.
But if it wasn't for Dignan I probably would of died.
When'd he tell you?
Where was I?
I can't believe he just jumped you.
She doesn't need to know.
No one to back me up. Now I have a good idea. So unless you come up with something better --
I think we better go home.
I had to give some to Inez.
Who's in the car?
Mr. Henry has an inside source. We call him Steve. That's where we get our information.
No fighting. It wasn't Bob's fault.
Shit, Dignan.
I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.
I'll try not to hold you back tomorrow.
Yeah. As a girl.
I'm in position, Scarecrow.
I've got a great view up here. I can see all the --
Help me move him.
Where's Kumar?
What are you doing?
You're kidding.
So is Mr. Henry going to come by and see me or anything?
You got to be kidding me.
What'd he get?
Why?
That's a sharp jacket.
I'd like to live in that place. Hinckley Cold Storage.
Tell me something. What the hell kind of name is Dignan?
Sure, sure. He's a great person, and I'd call bullshit on anybody who said differently. But I wonder if the kid has the goods  up here.
That was a test?
Did Dignan take the test?
No, that door over there.
Hector woudn't do anything.
Let them fight.
Are you serious?
You'll probably have them the rest of your life.
Where you going?
Why not?
At first they were going to charge me with manslaughter. That's partly why I was in custody so long. Sixty days.
How do you say nineteen?
Were you born in Mexico?
Does my skin feel soft, Anthony?
Did you ever hear of the S. Cooper Trust robbery?
Just settling an old score. You might say revenge.
Little Richard. Trust me. You're insane. Jesus, this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk. You do not want a guy like that loose on the streets.
OK, Bob.
If it's that easy why doesn't everybody grow them?
Don't you guys tell anybody about my plants.
You know, Bob, Anthony did kill someone. He electrocuted our janitor senior year.
I mean, Jesus Christ, Bob. You didn't have some vicious lunatic screaming, "I'm going to remember you!"
You can go first, Bob.
What do you mean get back?
Don't "Come on, Dignan" me.
Future Man would never go to jail for you, I'll tell you that.
Yes, I do.
It's not your decision and he's not your brother, Dignan.
Come on!
I'm sorry, Bob.
I couldn't hear anything.
What's wrong with Applejack?
Jesus Christ. What the fuck is that?
Hold on --
And what does that cover?
Dignan. Good to see you. Good to see you Applejack.  Who are you?
Is he in?
Why?
Where?
Hello, my friend. You in the Army, yes?
You like Chicanos?
Guess I'll get another Tecate.
Well, we'll see you later, Bob.
Neski was a roadblock. Without me, there's no company, no fortune. You owe me, Uri. One last push.
He left yesterday on the night train. He's probably just getting in now.  You'll have to hurry.
To know about it?  It was a kill squad. Black on black. Closed down two years ago. Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here.  You better take this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you're doing.
I want to know what happened.
What's definitive, is that I just lost two people in Berlin!
You don't know what you're getting into here.
Call a Mayday into Berlin station. We need snipers, DOD, whatever they got. Snipers?
Sorry to wake you.
Jesus... I, Zorn... I have to call his family. Tell them...
Sit down.
I don't exactly know what to say -- I'm sorry.
I'm not a traitor. I've served my ountry.
Something's been going on here in Europe. And it's still going on. Post Conklin. Who's been in Berlin?
No. It's because you don't know how they died.
It changes things. That knowledge. Doesn't it?
It doesn't matter. Your life is hard enough.
I should kill you... if it's true you should die... I should kill you now!
What's going on in Berlin?
She really did that? Told you not to kill me?  I had a woman once. But after a while, what do you talk about? I mean, for us. The work. You can't tell them who you are...
-- what? --
I'll get the book.
So...
You keep going to the shack. I'll meet you there in an hour.
I did.
You left a print! There was Kel that didn't go off! There was a partial print, they tracked it back to Treadstone! They know it's you!
Why are you here, then?
My first job.
What do you want?
There's only a Consulate, they sent a field officer out half an hour ago --
Alright... take it down.
You're sure?
Mr. Nevins?
I want that area secured, I want any evidence secured and I want it done now. Is that clear??
Good luck.
So he fooled you.
Did you?
Is it fresh?
Anything?
Someone dead from this household?
We'll sleep here tonight. You'll come home with me. We'll let the house, and the lands too; plenty of willing neighbors.
What are they doing?
I will meet you, but only one way -- if Robert the Bruce is there, and puts his hand on my Bible, and swears his loyalty to Scotland.
Young Robert, we are honored --
While I am in France fighting to expand your future kingdom I learn that Stirling castle is lost, our entire northern army wiped out! And you have done nothing?!
The weapon has been outlawed by the Pope himself!
Nor you. To you that word is as unfamiliar as love.
We make spears. A hundred spears. Fourteen feet long.
Your dreams aren't about freedom! They're about Marion! You have to be a hero, because you think she sees you! Is that it?
We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.
Call it a test of soldiery, then. The English won't let us train with weapons, so we train with stones.
I still say this is no test. A catapult can throw a stone farther than a man can.
You'll move
We must run in different directions!
So more men were slaughtered uselessly!
I sent for him -- and the little coward send you?!
No. I have it to ease the suffering of the children of this war.
Treason. Against whom?
Last night I slept with a member of the War Council.
Knowing his passion for his lost love, they next plotted to take him by desecrating the graves of his father and brother and setting an ambush at the grave of his wife. He fought his way through the trap and carried her body to a secret place! Now that is romance, Oui?
I am the Princess of Wales.
Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities? The executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?
You have... you have a husband.
M'lady... what kindness of you to visit a stranger.
Then tell me what a king is! Is he a man who believes only what others believe? Is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart? There is strength in you. I see it. I know it.
I thought I was dead when ya pulled that dagger!
Come, it'll help you sleep.
Why? What for?
You'd be surprised how often they are.
Evan wake up, oh please wake up!
Righty-tighty, lefty-lucy.
I don't like this place, Mom. It's creepy. Please can we go? I promise I won't make any more bad pictures!
These'll bring you luck, Crockett.
I... I blacked out.
I couldn't tell if they were real memories or just phantoms. You know, he might only have thought he actually remembered them...
And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could...
I found these. The others are still in storage.
What does that mean for Evan?
Are you hurting her?
This is where we're finding most of the hemorrhaging. The outer lining of the cerebral cortex.
Books?
It's an experiment with flatworms and a maze. You take a flatworm and run it through the maze until he's memorized it. Then you put a new flatworm in the maze. He's clueless. Banging into walls, getting lost, whatever.
You really think he wanted to kill you?
Get out. Both of you.
I'm sorry Kayleigh. This was a bad idea.
Welcome home. Thought you might like some fresh air for a change.
No, Evan. I don't know. It's been a long time. Fill me in.
Not since we were kids.
So how's Tommy?
Not if you remember my dad.
Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts?
When we were kids. Your dad was making a movie. Robin Hood or something?
It's my fault. I should have told you he was released a few weeks ago.
Wait. Something's not right. Isn't that your jacket?
I want you to take this, Lenny. Today's your day of atonement. I know how guilty you feel about that woman and her baby --
Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?
I've seen some sickening shit. I don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case.
Let me ask you a question. Just a little one that's been gnawing at me for years.
Oh? There's proof now?
Off to change everyone's life again, is that it? Maybe this time you'll pop up in some mansion while I wind up in Tijuana doing the donkey act.
Kayleigh? Do you ever think about "us?" I mean, wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us?
And...?
Easy does it, Evan! Don't be a bad boy or I'll tell mommy you were naughty.
That's dangerous! You could blow your hands off!
You can't play God, son. It must end with me. Just by being here, you may be killing your mother.
Remember, everyone! Only two weeks until your science projects are due.
Freeze! No "worm-boy". No "Mr. Worm," and no "Worm-Master-General!" Once you get a nickname like that you can't shake it. And I don't want everyone thinking I've got tapeworms coming out of my ass or something, okay?
It didn't feel like a dream.
Can... can... Can I have this?
I couldn't cut the rope.
Are you sure you even packed it?
Hurry! Let's go! Get him up, Evan! Come on!
What the hell are you doing?
No one thinks you're a piece of shit, Tommy.
Just get out, didja?
Nothing. Just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that.
Evan, guess what? Dad got a new video camera and we're all gonna be in a movie.
Wipe that sad-assed look off your face before you get us all busted. You see the way Evan's mom was looking at you?
Here you go, buddy.
Maybe it went out. Should someone check it?
And you want to know --
Monsieur Rick, I --
We read five times that you were killed in five different places.
Oh, two weeks, maybe three.
Now you finish locking up, will you, Carl?
-- Don't tell me where you're going.
The police break up our meeting. Herr Rick! We escaped in the last moment.
I'd better be going.
I see the bus is in. I'll take my shipment with me.
That's why I came over here to give them a chance to ransack my place.
Don't forget, you owe Rick's a hundred cartons of American cigarettes.
You see, my dear, the word has gone around.
And Mademoiselle?
There are only two other alternatives for him.
There's still nobody in the world who can play "As Time Goes By" like Sam.
A franc for your thoughts.
I wouldn't have come if I had known that you were here. Believe me, Rick, it's true. I didn't know.
Well, you can tell me now. I'm reasonably sober.
How did you get in?
Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.
Richard, Richard, we loved each other once. If those days meant anything at all to you --
Oh, it wasn't my secret, Richard. Victor wanted it that way. Not even our closest friends knew about our marriage. That was his way of protecting me. I knew so much about his work, and if the Gestapo found out I was his wife it would be dangerous for me and for those working with me.
Where is Rick?
I must find out what Berger knows.
Yes, I see. When I had trouble getting out of Lille, why didn't you leave me there? And when I was sick in Marseilles and held you up for two weeks and you were in danger every minute of the time, why didn't you leave me then?
Ask me?
Your work.
We'll come again.
Good morning.
Well, this might come in handy.
I wonder if you do. I wonder if you know that you're trying to escape from yourself and that you'll never succeed.
But we made a deal.
No. It's all arranged.
Monsieur Blaine, I don't ask you to explain anything.
Let us say that it is my request. That is a much more pleasant word.
I am making out the report now. We haven't quite decided whether he committed suicide or died trying to escape.
This is hardly the time or the place.
Even in Berlin.
And what if you track down these men and kill them? What if you murdered all of us? From every corner of Europe, hundreds, thousands, would rise to take our places. Even Nazis can't kill that fast.
You may find the climate of Casablanca a trifle warm, Major.
What else, my dear Major?
You repeat "Third Reich" as though you expected there to be others.
You see, Major, you have nothing to worry about Rick.
You see, Captain, the situation is not as much under control as you believe.
Captain Renault, are you entirely certain which side you're on?
Uh, huh. I have been thinking. It is too dangerous if we let him go. It may be too dangerous if we let him stay.
Yes, much too good a time. The place is to be closed.
If you are thinking of warning him, don't put yourself out. He cannot possibly escape.
I see. And what's Strasser doing here? He certainly didn't come all the way to Casablanca to witness a demonstration of your efficiency.
Make it ten. I am only a poor corrupt official.
It doesn't matter. There is no exit visa for him.
The winning side would have paid you much better.
Well, Ricky. I'm very pleased with you. Now you're beginning to live like a Frenchman.
Why do you interfere with my little romances?
How can you close me up? On what grounds?
-- What makes you think I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?
Well, they're all excellent reasons.
And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.
Sam's piano.
If you don't mind, you fill in the names. That will make it even more official.
What you just did for Laszlo, and that fairy tale that you invented to send Ilsa away with him. I know a little about women, my friend. She went, but she knew you were lying.
You'll excuse me, gentlemen. Your business is politics. Mine is running a saloon.
Uh, excuse me, please. Hello, Rick.
May I? Too bad about those two German couriers, wasn't it?
But why? Oh, you object to the kind of business I do, huh? But think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if I didn't help them. That's not so bad. Through ways of my own I provide them with exit visas.
But think of all the poor devils who cannot meet Renault's price. I get it for them for half. Is that so parasitic?
Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for him at the Blue Parrot.
He'll double what I pay you.
Boss!
Ain't you planning on going to bed in the near future?
You ever going to bed?
They grab Ugarte and she walks in. Well, that's the way it goes. One in, one out. Sam?
Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.
It took this test package thirty-two hours to get from Seattle to St. Petersburg, a distance of nine thousand miles.  And then it took forty-one hours to get from our warehouse in St. Petersburg to here, a distance of, what --
Nobody remembers that.
Can't.  Need water.
Okay look, I know you're tired, I know you're thirsty, but give it one more shot, you've just got to do a little more.
No.
If they can't see you, what's the point?
You know, Wilson, every now and then we should say thank you.  Thank you God.
What are you smiling about?  They'll be back.
Hmmm.  Feels like it might have gotten wet.
Did you really steal a crippled kid's bicycle to make your deliveries, or is that just some bullshit story?
I have to.
I would never --
What's that?
All that time I waited to go on a cruise, and you went without me.
What was inside?
My favorite doctor.  What's the verdict?
Yes, yes he did.
You're not out of Pascagoula, are you?
But chickens?
What happened to your pants?
I've got all this back pay coming.  Why don't you let me get you a place in town?
What a journey you've had.  It seems more than a person should have to bear.
Trying.
Okay.  After three years the PTR reverts to tape storage, which is okay because we access it through the CPC.  Here it is.  Ten packages from the same sender.  Baku. Delhi.  St. Petersburg.  The guy was a real road warrior.  This package was Kuala Lampur.  No activity in his account after this package.  No forwarding addresses after K.L.
It is Ibrim, I, I am a sorter.
What do you expect, from the guy who stole a kid's bicycle when his truck broke down?
I was making a point.
Forget it.
For the third time.
A hundred rubles St. Petersburg hits 95 percent in a month.
Talk is cheap.  Are we on or not?
You're fucking dead!
Cool ropes.
You were how long on this?
I'm serious.  The burning bush, the big picture, the words in neon...
Only if you can afford it.
He'll need clothes... some money...
I suppose it wouldn't hurt to *meet* him. What's his name again?
He *sniffs* that ether! I've seen him do it!
He *smells* like he could put you to sleep!
Why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him?
Daddy, it's a letter to *me*.
I've never seen a lobster.
I guess I'll see you around the orchards. Thanks for everything.
So. Not bored yet?
You have to come to my dad's lobster pound and see one, then.
I better go.
But you looked as if you liked it.
What's the *medical* explanation?
The screen is enormous! Imagine King Kong up *there*! Have you seen a lot of movies here?
But you had so much *responsibility*.
Sometimes... movies mostly bore Wally.
I *know* this was right.
Just tell me. Do you want me to go? Do you want me to stay?
You don't understand! It's her father...
Just tell me. I'll do whatever you want to do.
Isn't that like waiting and seeing?
And now that Wally's coming back, and because he'll certainly *need* you...
This came for you a couple of days ago. Olive asked me to bring it. With everything happening, I guess she forgot.
You can trust me. Is it Jack? It's not Jack, is it? It's *Muddy*! Is it Muddy?
You said, "Apples aren't exactly flying."
You've been giving him a *flying* lesson!
You're one of the best, Curly--we couldn't let just anyone take you.
Her temperature is a hundred and four.
That's a heavy sedation.
You mean they'll replace you with someone who won't perform abortions.
I just wanted to ask you...
Homer... doesn't King Kong think the woman is his *mother*?
Liberator...
This is all normal. Don't worry. The abortion procedure... it affects you. It's the ether, too. It'll take a little time.
I didn't see where you was pickin' this mornin', Homer, but you musta worked up a big appetite. You look like you're serious about gettin' to your lunch today!
First pregnancy?
Fuzzy is not uncommon. I tell you, there's something about the premature babies of alcoholic mothers. They seem susceptible to every damn thing that comes along.
He doesn't like it.  He's a boy, That's why.
I don't think so.
I thought you took care of this. It always breaks in the same place. It's your splice, isn't it?
Try to look at it this way. What choice does Buster have? What are his options? Nobody will ever adopt him.
Are you really so *stupid* that you imagine you're going to find a more gratifying life? What you're going to find is people like the poor people who get left here--only nobody takes care of them as well! And you won't be able to take care of them, either. There's no taking care of *anybody*-- not out there!
I don't need this--I know all about my condition.
I think Wally will be fine, Mrs. Worthington--he seems indestructible to me.
You're not yet three months, are you?
But you don't look very happy.
I bet the view looks better from the Worthin'tons'.
That just ain't right, Jack--your cigarette's gonna end up in nine or ten gallons of this batch of cider! That ain't right.
It's not that hard to find it in there, Jack--it'll take you just a minute. You just gotta go fishin'.
You can't think that a man who has *served* under such conditions as exist over there will be in the slightest daunted by a little *snow*-- have you no idea how harsh and primitive and full of *disease* that part of the world is?
I fail to see how a little Christianity could *hurt* anyone here!
When the plane was hit, the crew chief and the radioman jumped close together. The copilot jumped third. All on Captain Worthington's orders-- the captain was still flying the plane. None of the men of the ground could see the sky--that's how thick the jungle was. They never saw the plane crash--they never *heard* it crash. They never saw Captain Worthington's parachute, either.
They're *outrageous*, them rules!
That what happen--you lost you only daughter so's you killed yourself! That's what we say, all right.
Yeah, you really showed him, Daddy-- you just about cut your own hand off, and all you cut off *him* was his clothes!
Where do you think you're going?
You ever see a palm tree, Homer?
Brutal day. They say the streets are lined with money down here, but I guess you have to know the secret handshake. What are you drinking?
Silicon Valley?
So we've been meeting with banks all day. It's amazing how many ways they can say "no" without ever using the word.
Banks need to know how they're going to get their money back.
This has to happen fast.
Same thing with playing a con. You have to be able to see that deep.
And I think it's because of this redhead...
The Anti-Christ?
Your life flashing before your eyes?
Keeping the Fix happy.
Keep going. I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby.
Who's that?
What are you? New? Let me tell you how good this guy is. Last night, Al calls this bookie to settle up. Apparently he's been ducking him for like a month. So the guy asks him where he's got all this money all of a sudden, right? What does Al do? Does he tell him that he cashed in a fucking Bar Mitzvah bond? Does he tell him he's been giving head out back for twenty bucks a pop? No... He starts going on about this job he just pulled and how he fleeced some Wall Street asshole-type... How HE fleeced.
Fuck that. We're going too.
Poor bastard never knew what hit him. Jesus, I almost felt sorry for the guy.
Probably some investment banker or convertible-bonds-broker-dickhead. Did you see how fast he ran out of here? It's done. He's not coming back.
It can buy you a new and better you.
She up for this?
Minus one.
Buddy, that was business. Besides, you have more crew. Then there's you...
Why?
Stake you?
Come on. Harder.
That tip not work-out for you fellas?
I don't know what you're into with the King Pin, but whatever it is we get a piece, understand? We get a big piece. If we find out you're keeping us out, I may suddenly develop a conscious and give you up to Moonan myself. Say something stupid if we got a deal, Jake.
We have work. It pays a lot. Unless you figure on getting rich lifting wallets while old guys feel you up.
What about Customs?
We're going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy, if not be classy. You gotta do this thing and I don't even know if you can.
Uh... Everything okay?
You just put a mother of a jinx on us.
You told me to change my hair!
Why? Your mother not breast feed you or something?
How do you know I will?
He was looking out for you.
Jesus... Take it easy.
Yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before.
Him.
What do we do? We change the scam?
Feeling lucky today, Miles. Found a penny -- Heads up. There was an empty cab right outside my building. We hit every green light.
I'm sorry. Nothing under Pearson.
A ring for my wife. A lot like that one. In fact, it was that one.
Thank you. Sorry, I'm just a little anxious to give it to her. You take out of state checks?
Exactly. 'Cept this Gillette guy. He gets to walk around in three piece suits, hob knob with the Mayor, own a bank, that kinda shit. Meanwhile, the King sits holed up in the steam, afraid to even take a leak without me or Harlin watching the door.
Hey, I been on the ramp all my life, so I got no problem with the way you help yourself, Jake.
If you Feds are so hot for him, why don't we just bring him in right now?
You fucking little shit! You shopped me.
What kind of deal you looking to?
Is that your idea of arithmetic?
Last hand.
Good night?
No, no. I'm not ready for you. There's some vodka in the freezer.
You shouldn't have done that. I know what it meant to you.
Take it back. Till you sell your book.
Where've you been? I've got to give evidence in court at nine.
Are you drunk?
You're my conscience.
Without hope there's no point to anything.
How did you know I was here?
For Christ's sake, Jacko, don't look a gift horse in the mouth. Have you written that name down? Reynolds, at the Golden Lion.
I'm sorry, madam, we don't accept gratuities in the UK. It's different in South Africa.
Near the casino.
How did you hurt your hand?
I know that. But you can now.
Would you like a drink?
I don't think we should meet again.
You've been avoiding me.
Where to?
Where do you live, Jack?
Coming up to two years now.  But I was away for six months.
I'm off to a little watering hole. Why don't you join me? Relax.
I can't give you a lift back tonight.
Rough day?
You don't recognise me? You had me barred. You fucking little worm.
David Reynolds, I'm the Manager here. Sit down, John.
Stacks of 20. Rows of 5.
Not with your own cloth. Besides, your pockets will be stitched.
What makes you so sure?
Ever?
Next point. Friendships between croupiers inside or outside the casino are discouraged. Relationships with females working here are expressly forbidden.
That hair will have to go.
I just want the job.
Why don't you take a break, Jack.
There she is. Definite 99%-plus probability that the planet is going to deviate from its normal orbit in another twelve thousand rotations. It'll spiral in toward its sun, and --
I can tell, the damn thing just doesn't understand.
The key!
Where's the fail-safe key?
We've got to disarm the bomb.
Pinback, I have a computer reading of nine five seven seven.
Well... now what? What do, you have for us now. Boiler?
Remember what we found? Fourteen light years for a fucking mindless vegetable that looked like a limp balloon and went squawk and let a fart when you touched it. Remember?
All right, I have detonation time at... Wait a minute, something's wrong with the clock.  All right, I have detonation time at... no, that can't be right, it says three years.  Okay, I have six minutes exactly. Does that check out down there?
Fail safe in lock. Four minutes to drop, 22 minutes to detonation. This is Sergeant Pinback calling Bomb #20. Do you read me, bomb?
One hundred twenty seconds to drop, bomb, have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?
Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?
What I'm getting at is this: the only experience that is directly available to you is your sensory data. And this data is merely a stream of  electrical impulses which stimulate your computing center.
That's it.
And you wouldn't want to explode on the basis of false data, would you?
Ah, what was that again, I still can't hear you?
Yes.
In a second.
New star.  Hey, guess what? I got a new star on the readout.
What are you gonna name it?
The new star. What are you gonna name it?
Hey, Doolittle, think we'll ever find real intelligent life out there?
Veil nebula.
-- open circuit breakers --
Hello, Pinback, are you there?
I need a diameter approximation.
Phoenix Asteroids? Never heard of 'em.
It's funny, but I kind of sit around, you know, a lot of time to myself...
Sorry to interrupt your lunch, sir, but I'm in the Computer Room, and I think I've located the malfunction. The scanner shows it to be some sort of fault in the communications laser, down by the Emergency Air Lock. Can't pinpoint it exactly, but I'm going down there with a starsuit and try to find it.
Ah, Lieutenant Doolittle? Sir?
Doolittle, Doolittle, where are you?
What happened, Doolittle?
Commander Powell, this is Doolittle. Ah, there's something serious come up, sir, and I have to ask you something.
What's that, sir?
Yes sir. Negative effect.
What were you saying, Commander, about the bomb?
Commander? Are you still there?
Men... men... what happened, men?
I never woulda done it.  Probably not, anyway.  I mean, I actually think you're pretty cool.
Call the skank now or I start redecorating.
Ass like your, I can see why he's worried you'll punk.
I was crazy about you...am crazy about you.  But you keep everyone at arm's length like there's some great big dark something going on that-- I don't know... It's just that the more I tried to get close to you, the more you pulled away.
It's a sweep.  C'mon.
Out there.
But I'm afraid of--
Nobody there to sign for it, mon.  What's a bruddah s'posed to do, ride around all day with the damn package?
Which is none of your business...or mine.
What're you lookin' at me for?  I'm not his next of kin.  Anyway, I don't got that kind of cash lyin' around.
Same old story.  Not interested.
Which means I gotta fence it for two. Who's got that kinda scrilla lying around, these being the worst of the times.
I made you coffee.  That oughta help you cope with the injustice of the world a little.
What a creep.
What's with you?  Every week this scumbag puts the squeeze on us and every week you roll out the welcome wagon like he's family.
Your daughter's the only leverage they have to keep you quiet.
No...
I was expecting someone else.
You have good taste.  French, 1920's, attributed to Chitarus.
Who is...
How'm I s'posed to ever sleep there again knowing some pervo's probably touched everything I own?
Expensive gifts, surprise late-night visits, over-the-top flattery... You always come on this strong?
Suppose I could help you locate the other ones.
Not that I don't enjoy a good urban legend now and then but what does any of this have to do with me?
We got separated right away.  I never knew how many made it.
See you're back and still rocking the boat.
Forty-seven people drowned last night off the coast of Vancouver after paying smugglers twenty thousand apiece to get into Canada so they could get work in order to eat.  Only they got marched overboard at gunpoint instead.
Know where I can find her?
But she does work here?
Max something.  I got no clue where she stays.
You said you knew where my fiance was the other night.
This is not a place you wanna go.
I asked you to keep that thing outside.
You got a punk-ass mouth on you, kid.
She was a nurse.  She must've lived near there, somewhere, near the...  ...the clinic.  There must be some registry of nurses or medical technicians or whatever for Wyoming.
Just give it to me.  I'll remember.
Tell me the truth.  Am I a female fog bank?
Look, you're a player... I'm bringing you this on a plate, and my fee is just the normal cost of doing business.
It's payday, need me to pick up your check?
Hey, Sketchy--
I don't see how you cheating on Natalie involves me.
Or do you think we're just so grateful to have one of you idiots we'll look the other way, which is arrogant and condescending.
Max, what did I do to deserve a friend like you?
True, but--
Hot run to 842 Beulah, corner of Haight... And you can tell your pal Theo he just got his worthless ass fired. Not that he cares but the wife and kid might.
Thanks, miss.
Whoa. Some of this hard liquor's a tad too manly for me. I'm a brewski man myself.
You're a little scrawny, but thanks to the concert we're low on amateurs. Name?
You kidding? This is Detroit. Drink?
Oh, Dicky, I c-c-can't...
Sorry.
We've got to take this slow...
Ann Arbor?
Coming dad.  I'll call you. Soon as we get a phone. Bye.
...at twenty-thirty hours.
Shit, that dork is Jam.
Second floor girls' john! Two minutes! He'll never look there!
Too bad we're stuck in electronics or...
But... but, St. Bernard's is way the hell over in the next county!
There's only so much trouble an individual can get into till it just doesn't matter anymore, Lex. You familiar with a condition known as Absolute Zero?
Cool, bro, now listen up...
I think we should try sneaking in.
Don't worry about it. They're perfectly safe. We can pick them up after school. My mom won't be home. It's no problem.
Oh no, Jam. I'm not falling for that twice.
It was stolen!
Jeremiah, what are you doing?
But, mom!
I made an appointment with Father Phillip McNulty at St. Bernard's. We're to see him directly where he will register you on the spot.
What?!
Poor, Jam, man. Imagine having to stash your KISS records inside Carly Simon album covers. No question, Mrs. Bruce is a psycho-bitch from hell.
The Chinese have a proverb: "That which appears too good to be true, usually is." There's gotta be a catch.
Please sir, don't beat me up. I do have a KISS ticket, but not on me.
What do you want?
Look, you can have my wallet...
Is that your final answer?
I feel bad for his family.
Like a DeLorean.
Each vessel travels along a vector path through space-time... along its centre of gravity.
That... is highly unlikely. You're talking about an act of God.
I'm not following you.
Why do I have to sleep with Donnie? He stinks.
That's not what I heard. Now they think I did it.
What'd you do, Donnie? What'd you do!
Don't look so freaked.
Oh, I... have those too.  What kind of problems does your dad have?
I always wanted it to be at a time when... when it reminds you how beautiful the world can be.
So, we call them... IMGs.
Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy these glasses for your infant, and they wear them at night when they sleep.
What? How long was I asleep?
Will you please talk to me?
Well, life isn't that simple. So what if Ling Ling kept the cash and returned the wallet? That has nothing to do with either fear or love.
You're such a fuck-ass.
Oh, please tell me, Elizabeth, how exactly does one suck a fuck?
I wish I knew where you went at night.  Did you toilet paper the Johnson's house?
You know... it would be nice to look at you some time... and see my son. I don't recognise this person today.
If I'm lucky.  So... I won't be back until the first. Your dad will be back on Sunday, so I've put Elizabeth in charge until then. She has the car... so she can drive you to your therapy tomorrow.
Donnie Darko, perhaps, given your recent brush with mass destruction, you can give us your opinion?
Because the rabbits are us, Donnie.
So, I met a new friend.
I think he saved my life.
Follow him where?
Do you believe that the world is coming to an end?
And when I clap my hands twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?
What about your family, Donnie?
How many times have you seen Frank?
Who is they? Is Frank part of some larger group?
And they grow out of our stomachs?
People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.
Yes. I went to jail.
What is going to happen?
Why would I tell Mom?
No I don't.  She worries about you.
If that's what you think is necessary.
No. I took a year off to be with you.  Of course I care. Don't get angry.  What?
Kitty, I don't know what to say. They've suspended him for two days.  Ever since this jet fiasco, I honestly don't know what has gotten into him.
Rose... I have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning. And as you know, the girls also leave for Los Angeles tomorrow morning. Now, as their coach... I was the obvious choice to chaperone them on the trip.
Is Mom okay?
That was your mom. She wanted you to have this.
Oh, Mom's okay. They're just givin' her a ride back. She almost blew outta the back of Loretta's pick-up on the way over.
You stop right there. You are a good person. Good things happen to good people.
All right, say "Airport Ho-Jo."
I gotta work with these women.
Amber...
Go on! Get out!
Ow!
Okay, okay!  Listen-up. Coupla notes from last night's dress rehearsal.  Number one, Gladys says a coupla yous are gettin' sexy with your hips durin' the "Physical Fitness" routine...
This, this... This is bullshit!
If you want seconds, then I'll make sure it's hot enough for ya.
So, anyone talk to Janelle?
And the bite marks on my ears?
Hi.
It's just the guys that are... you know, makin' the movie about the pageant. I told you about 'em.
Y'know, if you have, you got all the pictures of the winner you need.
Well, excuse me, Annette, but I'm braggin' up your kid, here.  Amber's gonna be the next Diane Sawyer, y'know...
Go on home, Loretta. Come on. Go on, the party's over.
C'mon, Rebecca, you wanted it. Now get up there. Ride it side-saddle if you have to -- like a horse. C'mon, now.
We're also the co-founders of the Minnesota Modeling Academy. Applications are at the tiki bar. We'll wave the fifty dollar application fee if you list a friend and put her address.
Okay?
Do you think that most people would say that teenage beauty pageants are a good idea?
And the year before that?
Can you remember the theme of your favorite pageant?
...Oh, yeah-right. I ain't gonna be in no goddamn pageant! Look what happened to that dork-ass farm girl.
Yah -- she's damn near as good as that little black fella -- with the glass eye.
Gladys -- Gladys! Look out!
It's a two-hundred dollar fine!
Are we on "Cops?" Are we on "Cops?" Are we on "Cops?"
Let's get this straight right now. We wouldn't have been late at all if it wasn't for you.
Of course you're All aware a king must have an heir some one to pass the family name along will some one tell me where I'd ever get an heir if a king can do no wrong
Suppose a pretty dame Into my castle came - And let us say that I was going strong.  She might be stuck on me, but what good would it be, if the king can do no wrong.
Here I am, Father.
Who to?
That's not right yet... put back "President" and take out "dear"... How does it read now?
That's what I wanted in the first place.  Tear it up and send it airmail.
I wonder what's keeping His Excellency?
Yes -- why?
You haven't been still a moment since you've been here.  You act as if you had neurosis --
That's no good.  I like to work on the outside.  I must have something easy.
I don't wanna stick out my tongue.
Look, I'm a very nervous man.  I gotta have a job where I come to work at eleven -- go to lunch at twelve -- and quit at one.  And twice a year I gotta have a six month vacation.
You get half mine and I get half yours.
Wait a minute.  What kind of an army do you think we oughtta have?
Send in the next girl.
You're right about that guy -- I think we've got something.
That's not fair -- we've only got fifty thousand.
Not a bad idea.  If our horses get tired they can ride your men for a change.  Now, I don't mind letting you have our horses, but you must promise to put them through their maneuvers.
With a gun like that you can kill some of your own men.
Fine.  We'll throw in the matches before we make the delivery.  By the way, how're you fixed for spys?
How'm I doing, boss?
Chicolini, you've come just in time. We need a man who's fearless, brave. A man who's willing to die, if necessary.
If any man should come between A husband and his bride, We find out which one she prefers By letting her decide.  If she prefers the other man, The husband steps outside; We stand him up against the wall And Pop goes the Weasel!
I shall dance for you tonight as I've never danced before.
Are you getting tired?
That's even a greater honor.
I'll keep the greetings -- but you can send back the good will... what we need right now is twenty million dollars.
Excellency, may I present my niece.
That's what you think.
Give me that again!
Your Excellency, the eyes of the world are upon you.  Notables from every land are gathered here in your honor --  This is a gala day for us.
You've made a wonderful impression. Your views are liberal... It is easy to see you have an open mind.
Your Excellency, something terrible has just happened.
My purse has been stolen -- the plans of war are in it.
I -- I may be wrong, but I suspect the Secretary of War.
Ambassador!  I am so anxious for you to meet our new dictator.
So that's the one you want to marry.
This is all Firefly's fault -- that idiot, that fool...
If only we can get his Excellency to listen to reason...
And here is one of Frederick's mother.
Did it go well, darling?
Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?
Freddie?... Freddie, don't look so discouraged.
What do you mean?
But I thought you said that he was rather... simple?
Yes.
More romances for John?
I found it.
Like this.
What are you going to do?
Pull the other one, why don't you! We made a deal!
Now I think we really do understand one another.
You've acquired a taste for this?
Why isn't he in the General Ward, then?
Have you contacted the British Home and the Royal Hospital?
Two o'clock then... you know Treves... It seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance.
It's only a physical problem. He has trouble with certain sounds because of the constrictive deformity of the mouth. But he can talk, and has a great eagerness to make contact with people who will let him. So if you have any difficulty understanding what he is saying, just tell me and I'll make it clear.
...As I said, it's only a physical problem... but I do feel that Mr. Merrick is very flattered that you're taking the time and trouble to meet him, and he's most anxious to make a good impression, so he might seem rather nervous.
Yes, I spoke to both the British Home and Royal Hospital for Incurables. I'm afraid that they weren't very encouraging, but they said they'd bring it up at their next committee meeting, so we should have their answers shortly.
Excellent. We shall present them, along with the other particulars of the case to the committee. I want them to see, exactly, how horribly his body has been affected. You and I shall vouch for his inner qualities.
Don't we?
It was a great pleasure to meet you, Mr. Merrick.
Abominable things these machines. One can't reason with them.
O fair Katharine, if you will love me soundly with your French heart, I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue. Do you like me, Kate?
What say you, fair one? That the tongues of men are full of deceits?
Well, even to work there would be wonderful. Is it beautiful?
Tell me about it, please!
It's all arranged. I'll send over some evening gowns for the sisters that you select to accompany Mr. Merrick. You'll be using the Royal entrance and Princess Alexandra herself will be there to welcome him to her private box.
Good morning, Mr. Merrick.
John... Merrick
Mmmerrick.
Mr. Treves, there is something I've been meaning to ask you for some time...
Are you sure? Because I can take it back.
Mr. Treves! Treves.
Will the cathedral be finished soon, John?
No, John, not one that I can see.
Watery headed bunch.
Oh?... Well, quickly please, Mothershead, I'm overdue.
Mr. Treves, some more books arrived for Mr. Merrick.
Yes sir.  What's that?
Don't lie to me. I know all about it. You were SEEN. Where did you take him?
YOU BASTARD! You tortured him. YOU TORTURED HIM, you bastard. WHERE is HE?
Pardon me?
Open up! I know you're in there!
Right! Where is he?
Well... where is he?
Ah! So you admit there IS someone!
It's your fantasy...
Please! Please! What are those?
What's the matter?
WHY?
Then I shall come too.
But --
Now what CAN you want with me, Erik the "Viking"?
Is there nothing men can do?
And will the dead ever return, Freya?
Your Majesty! We come from a world where there IS no music. Where men live and die by the axe and by the sword...
I'll tell you what...
Because that's how he makes his money, by war and plunder!
Is there something the matter with it?
But it IS! Look!
Have you done this sort of thing before?
It's obvious you haven't raped anyone in your life.
No... right... this is RAPE... Mark you, I'm not saying I couldn't get to like you... in fact... well, to be quite honest, I prefer it when there's some sort of mutual feeling between two people...
No. It isn't rape then, is it?
Oh! Stop talking as if we were married!
Louder.
Thanks for saving me from a fate worse than death.
What are you talking about?
But. You're not even afraid of DEATH, Thorfinn!
We're missing all the fun...
It's always the women that start the trouble.
I want to die...  No, I don't!
Slower! In... Out...
Ohh! I wanted to sit next to Leif.
SHUT UP!
Because... you're... you're the Gods....
What's the matter with them?
So Halfdan the Black's using magic, is he? Well, I have a magic to match his!
But HOW?
I AM one, Dad!
ROW!
Hy-Brasil?
I came to find my grandfather.
Yeah... well...
That's why they call me... Leif the Lucky.
How did he do that?
Same thing, isn't it?
Are you all right?
You don't need to feel bad about being sea-sick, you know.
I know. I know.
Is it sort of... like a sinking feeling in your stomach?
I'm not worth risking your life for.
For your own sake... For the others... I...
Who's that?
Can't make enough axe-heads!
The Blacksmith's Code says I must...
Wasn't it, Keitel?
I can't swim! I can't swim!
Shut up!
I was a Berserk for King Harald Fairhair...
He drove me mad!
Well I'M certainly not, either.
Shut up.
Thorfinn! You can't die!
And don't forget: never let your enemy get behind you.
And if you have to kill somebody, KILL them! Don't stop to think about it.
Thanks, guys.
Yeah.
I remember you turned around. Your face was dark and your hair was backlit -- I could see a halo of frizz -- you asked me if things were okay between Naomi and me.
But I thought, I don't know, I thought it was cool that you were sensitive enough to know what I was feeling and that you were attracted to it.
No, it was lovely.
Ms. Kruczynski?
I'm so excited. Yay!
Aw, c'mon, live dangerously. Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car.
It's okay if I sit closer? So I don't have to scream. Not that I don't need to scream sometimes, believe me.  But I don't want to bug you if you're trying to write or something.
Really? Because --
Yeah. Tom Waits says it in --
I'm sure you would.
Huckleberry Hound?
Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts?
Yeah. Although it hardly fits. I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.
Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way.
The song's 9th and Hennepin. I spent most of the train ride trying to remember. "Till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill out/Over the side to anyone who'll listen." Remember?
Thanks very much. That was very nice of you.
Um --
You like that?
It's pretty.
God, that feels so fucking good. Take yours off.
Ready for another?
What do you want to hear?
Thanks.
Me neither. But sometimes I have premonitions, so, I don't know. Maybe that's just coincidence. Right? Y'know, you think something and then it happens, or you think a word and then someone says it? Y'know?
Well, for the last week, anyway! He's kind of a kid. Kind of a goofball, but he's really stuck on me, which is flattering. Who wouldn't like that? And he's, like, a dope, but he says these smart and moving things sometimes, out of nowhere, that just break my heart. He's the one who gave me that crow photograph.
Exactly! I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again, so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know? And that's where psychic stuff comes in. Like, it just isn't right with him. Y'know?
Tomorrow?
Yo ho ho!
How can you watch this crap?
Let's talk about it later.
What?!
You don't tell me things, Joel. I'm an open book. I tell you everything. Every damn embarrassing thing. You don't trust me.
Oh?
I want my mommy.  I don't want to lose you, Clem.
There's this guy. I heard him talking in my apartment. He's one of the eraser guys. And he fell for you when they were erasing you, so he introduced himself the next day as if he were a stranger and now you're dating him.
He stole a pair of your panties while you were being erased!
Look at you, cutey! What are we doing?
We did talk about Naomi.
Yeah. I don't ever know what to say.
Me too. There's this poem --
Do you know her poem that starts "Seaside gusts of wind,/And a house in which we don't live...
I do sort of live with somebody though.
Cool.
A bully? Moi?
It's true.
Hi, it's Joel.
I just got in.
The driver waved. So casual, friendly.
I love you and if you knew that... if I told you what happened... I'll explain everything, what we meant to each other. I'll tell you everything about our time together. You'll know everything again and...
Gotta get home. How could she do this to me? How could she not care about what we meant to each other. What a fuck! What a fucking monster she is!
So then she just stops calling.
Okay. I wish you could come.
We'll start with your most recent memories and go backwards -- There is an emotional core to each of our memories -- As we eradicate this core, it starts its degradation process -- By the time you wake up in the morning, all memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared. Like a dream upon waking.
I'm sorry you saw one of our notification cards. You never should have.
What? What do you mean?
So what's going on, Joel?
Yeah. Come to bed. I'm cold.
So... you haven't been involved with anyone in all this time?
So I'm going to get some sleep. I'm glad you're okay.
I love quotes. So did Winston Churchill. He actually has a quotation in Bartlett's about Bartlett's. Isn't that trippy?
It's just... y'know... I mean...
It's freezing out.
Nietzsche. Beyond Good and Evil. Found it my Bartletts.
Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard! It seems really appropriate.
It's stopped.
No way. I can handle this.
You were in red. That red sweater with the little flowers, I think. You were leaning against his car.  He looked a little like a kid. Kind of goofy and wide-eyed. I'd never seen him look like that before. Happy. You looked beautiful. You looked in love.
Mary...
It's fine, Mary. I'm happy to hear it.
Do you love me? Did you love me? Something. I listened to my tape. I can't believe I've been sitting right in front of it for a year. It's like listening to someone else's story. I mean, I hear myself talking about having sex with you and I can't even imagine you naked. I can't even say "naked" to you!
You made me have you erased! I loved you. I love you! How could you --
Okay, what happened right before he disappeared?
Jesus. All right, what's the address.
Ah, your journal. This will be invaluable.
So, I've got to drop the van off.
She should not have done this, Stan. As mad as she was... as justifiably --
The voltage looks fine.
Patrick, let's just get through this. We have a long night ahead of us.
Yeah?
Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?
I gotta tell you something. I kind of fell in love with her last night.
Mary hates me. I've never been popular with the ladies.
What's your bartlett's?
But that's an old story now...... I can't believe that you would leave the Butte.
I know, but where do you reside when you aren't visiting New York?
About being a cowgirl. What's it all about? When you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl.
No, I guess not.
Every time I tell you that I love you, you flinch. But that's your problem.
What do they do to you boys in those Ivy league schools, anyway? Strap you down and pump the Nature out of you? They can even press the last drop of Nature out of a Mohawk buck. Why, send a shaman or cannibal to Yale for four years and all he'd be fit for would be a desk in the military-industrial complex and a seat in the third row at a Neil Simon comedy. Jesus H.M.S. Christ! If Harvard or Princeton could get hold of the Chink for a couple of semesters they'd turn him into a candidate for the Bow Tie Wing of the Hall of Wimps. Oogie boogie.
She's a young thing who works on my ranch. Real name is Sally Jones or something wooden like that. She's cute as a hot fudge taco, and, of course, it takes verve to change one's name so charmingly. But she stinks like a slut just the same.
Sissy, Sissy, blushing bride, you can desist from wearing paths in those forgotten highways. The Countess has arranged a job for you. And what a job...
The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday female deodorant sprays may cause such harmful reactions as blisters, burns and rashes. Although the FDA judges that the reported reactions are not sufficient to justify removal of these products from the market, they are sufficient to warrant the proposed mandatory label warnings.
But Countess...
But here you are, still a virgin -- you are virginal yet, aren't you?
Sissy, don't play dumb with me! You're a good model but a shitty actress. The cowgirls are involved in this whooping crane disappearance. You know perfectly well they are. Last seen in Nebraska. Didn't make it to Canada. Siwash Lake is between Nebraska and Canada. The cowgirls have possession of Siwash Lake. And who else but Jellybean's wild cunts could possibly conceive of doing something so diabolical as to tamper with the last flock of some nearly extinct birds? How much do you know about it? Have they murdered those cranes the way they murdered my moo cows?
...do you copy?
Shit! Do not do that! Where the fuck are you?
...and the gravity drive goes where no man has gone before.
Will it work?
Damn, Dr. Weir, don't scare us like that. Coffee?
Coffee.
It was like... nothing was there... and then Justin appeared and the Core... became metal...
I don't know what happened to Justin.
He's a rescue technician. Peters, medical technician. DJ...
How is he?
Of course not. Justin just climbed into the airlock because he felt like it. Just one of those things.  I swore I'd never lose another man. I came close today. Real close.
90 over 50 and falling... .
Oh my god OH MY GOD...
You've reached the First Containment Seal. The engineering decks are on the other side.
The ship had life support systems for eighteen months. They're been gone seven years.
Peters, I want you to go through the ship's log, see if we can't find some answers.
That's a negative, Starck.
Captain Miller, I just want to say...
I've been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach Neptune space.
Dr. Weir, I need you on the bridge.
What could cause them?  What's in the Core?
It's insane.
What about it?
We barely have enough power for life support as it is, if we can't stop the drain, we're not gonna make it.
That's bullshit and you know it! You built this fucking ship and all I've heard from you is bullshit!
Maybe you're right. But it's still my command, and I have leeway to abort when I feel there is an unacceptable threat to my crew. And I think there is.  Starck, download all the files from the Event Horizon's computers. Coop, Smith, finish moving the CO2 scrubbers back onto the Clark.
I told you... She won't let you leave...
If you miss me, you'll blow out the hull. You'll die too.
What are you?
I don't like it either, but you know the rules: we get the call, we go. Is the course locked in?
It is now.  We're locked in.
Captain Miller...
Do we have enough time for a weld?
We're losing pressure at 280 liters a second and our oxygen tanks are cracked. In three minutes, our atmosphere will be gone. We are fucking dead.
...you break all the laws of physics, you think there won't be a price? You already killed the first crew...
Sir.
It's building up with every breath we take. And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot.
Who?
It's not bullshit, it's the only conclusion the data supports...
What?
BLOW THE FUCKER UP.
Claire...
Can you see a body?
No. I saw nothing.
Hey...
Jesus, that is one big ugly fat fucker...
Foredecks. Crew quarters, bridge, medical and science labs, hydroponics, what have you. That central section connects the forward decks to the Engineering containment area. Can we move in closer?
What the hell is that?
What?
This is U.S. Aerospace Command vessel Lewis and Clark, hailing Event Horizon, Event Horizon, do you read...? This is the Lewis and Clark, hailing...
The scope is lit, it's right in front of us...
Range 500 meters and holding. Turbulence is dropping off...
Relativity, yes. We can't break the law of relativity, but we can go around it. The ship doesn't really move faster than the speed of light; it creates a dimensional gateway that allows the ship to instantaneously "jump" from one point in the universe to another, light years away.
Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
How'd you know it was me?
We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped.
He didn't mean it. You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
What are you doing here?
Good thing it ain't workin... Reed, what are we doing here? This guy's fast-food, strip-mall science --
I can't take this.
This is your dream, Reed. You should be the one up there.
Okay. I've uh, got some questions, from Sue. That she thought might be better coming from me... Can you, you know, go to the bathroom... like normal...
It's about to be a broken face.
We're working as hard as we can --
Where... where am I?
They said that's not such a good idea, the shock alone could --
No more cracks about how I look.
Not only could you kill yourself, but you could set fire to Earth's atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it.
Johnny. SUPERNOVA.
Wait. You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?
I'm driving.
Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here. And keep it quiet. I don't need this to hit the press.
Well, uh, based on our history... you can handle the biogenetics, and I'll focus on the molecular physics. Or, uhm, maybe I should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho--
You're happy for me and Victor.
It has to be the cloud. It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
What?
It's not "invisibility" per se. You're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field. That's what you projected on the Bridge.
Reed. I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.
But we're the focus, right Reed? Reed...?
Reed. How close are we to a cure?
I can... make it work.
Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
Come on, Ben, come on...
I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you?
Didn't go as planned? It was a catastrophe. You ruined the lives of four people --
What are you doing here?
But I'm not done with the machine --
It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much.
What are you doing?
Victor, I'm sorry I --
If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us worse, maybe even kill us.
'Scuse me.
If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
How much did they cost?
What's there to do at the Point? God, Lisa, we've been going together almost two years, and...
Go ahead. Just make it quick.
I can't find it, mon!
Thanks for getting rid of those flowers.
Is everything okay at work?
Why? Because she won't sleep with you?
Since when do you shop at the Flea Market anyway?
You're not going to tell me, are you?
Come on. Clean that counter off Brad. Let's go. Play ball.
Did you threaten this man or use profanity in any way?
Are you really a virgin?
Listen. I feel pretty strange here. Because Mark really likes you, and he's my friend.
What's wrong?
What's going on?
How do you know it's mine? We only did it once.
Yeah. My brother Art got his girlfriend one once.
You... are a wuss. Part wimp. Part pussy.
Did you get her number?
Did you get her name?
I would. Yeah.
I can see it all now. This is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at Fotomat this summer. You bought forty bucks of fuckin' film and you never even talked to her.
And that is how you talk to a girl, Rat. Voila. You can't miss.
Did you go home and get it?
Damone, are you there?
I come for the seafood. It's great! Hey... you know what, Mark? I found your wallet the other day. You want it back?
If you ask me, she's pretty aggressive. You understand what I'm saying?
All right, what you want to do is go to the Free Clinic and tell the doctor that you have sex regularly -- several times a week -- and that you need Nornel One Plus Fifty's.
How've you been?
Seriously, Merv, everything is great. I was thinking about picking up some hash this weekend, maybe going up to the mountains.
We just missed the turnoff to the party.
Come on, Stacy, it's your section and your man.
Stacy, what are you waiting for? You're fifteen. I did it when I was thirteen. It's no huge thing. It's just sex. If you don't, one of the other girls will.
I can't believe I start high school tomorrow.
Just kidding. About 10cc.
I guess Ron hasn't called yet.
I sent a letter to Doug today. I'll be so glad when he gets out here.
All right! Here's another one. 'The most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first, you climax first, you and your mate climax together?'
What's Doug do in Chicago?
What do you think?
It couldn't be.
I really thought he would show up. I waited... and waited... and waited...
Not coming? What happened?
But what are you going to do?
I can't believe it! But what about Doug?
Mr. Spicoli?
I couldn't make it in time.
I don't know, mon. The food lines took forever.
Now, Mr. Spicoli, comes a rare moment for me. Now I have the unique pleasure of squaring our account. Tonight, you and I are going to talk in great detail about the Davis Agreement, all the associated treaties, and the American Revolution in particular. Now if you can just turn to Chapter 47 of Lord of Truth And Liberty.
Thanks for picking me up.
Are you really nineteen?
Are you sure there's nothing else I can bring you?
Well... the manager, Mr. Heem, would like to meet him. Nothing unusual. Mr. Heem likes to meet all our large accounts... put them on a personal basis... just a chat and a handshake, you understand.
Well, uh. She didn't say Mr. Duke. But since I know you're here with the Police Convention...
Naked!?
Cut their goddamn heads off. Every one of them. That's what we're doing in California.
We know where he lives, but we can't get near the house.
Hell, I really hate to hear this. Because everything that happens in California seems to get down our way, sooner or later. Mostly Atlanta. But that was back when the goddamn bastards were peaceful. All we had to do was to keep 'em under surveillance. They didn't roam around much... But now Jesus, it seems nobody's safe.
I want you to understand that this man at the wheel is my attorney! He's not just some dingbat I found on the Strip. He's a foreigner. I think he's probably Samoan. But it doesn't matter, does it? Are you prejudiced?
We won't make the nut unless we have unlimited credit.
Savage Henry has cashed his check! We're going to rip his lungs out!
Oh, Jesus! Did you see what god just did to us?
You better be careful. Plenty of vultures out here. They'll pick your bones clean before morning.
I just went upstairs to see this man Lacerda. I told him I knew what he was up to...  He says he's a photographer! But when I mentioned Savage Henry he freaked! He knows we're onto him!
That's the press table. Where you have to sign in for our credentials. Shit, let's get it over with. You handle that, and I'll check on the room.
Look, what are we doing here? Are we here to entertain ourselves, or to do the job?
I hate to say this, but this place is getting to me. I think I'm getting The Fear.
I have to go.
Can we make it?
Did you see that? Some sonofabitch kicked me in the back.
Don't run. They'd like any excuse to shoot us.
That dirty bastard! I knew it! He's got hold of my woman!
I want that fucking radio!
You bastard! You'd do that, wouldn't you?
The cops?
You bastard! I need a lawyer immediately!
You degenerate pig!
NO! Stop talking like that.
NO! I felt sorry for the girl, I wanted to help her!
The only alternative was to take her out to the desert and feed her remains to the lizards. But, it seemed a bit heavy for the thing we were trying to protect: My attorney.
As your attorney, I advise you to tell me where you put the goddamn mescaline.
I saw these bastards in Easy Rider, but I didn't believe they were real. Not like this. Not hundreds of them!
Read the newspapers.
Like big lizards.
Sure. It's all on the Q.T., but everybody who matters is with us all the way down the line.
Alright, Alice... you'll be contacted by Inspector Rock. Arthur Rock. He'll be posing as a politician.
Fuck the car. They should make these things with a goddamn FM radio.
May I see your license.
In that case, maybe she can help.
Oh, and don't bother to make up the room. That way we won't have to risk another of these little incidents, will we?
I will not die because of him!
We should go! We should go right now!
Are you two all right? Did you see that!? They left! We made it! I think we made it!
You know where it is?
I don't think you should...
One keg of Beast for the basement, then, truck's dry.
You got something better?
That's the oldest of the bunch, looked like the Grandpapa. We caught the little one, Junior, in the cooler there. As we've seen, what he lacks in size he more than makes up for in speed.
They're right here.
Don't bullshit me! If you know a way out of this place and you're holding out --
Ohhh.
That's an unwise thing to say, you know that?
Any more ideas Animal Planet?
I'm telling ya, you got the cloth too deep, you're asking for it.
Come on!
What now, Geronimo?
Your parents of relation?
I'm in.
We gotta be close.
Yeah, the lot's right there. My truck is right out back.
How are you holding up?
Oh, no.
It's much safer in there, sweety.
What? Really?
Jesus Christ on the cross... Someone make sense.
Max?
Nine?
I'll go with ya.
Blow the goddamn hatch!
You are taking a chance that is not worth the risk.
JUST A BAT! I'M FINE! JUST A BAT! SORRY!
OH JESUS!
Let's move.
What's wrong?
Hold it!
Let's go!
Get to your cars!
I admire your strength.
Are you lying to me?
Here, take a few of these. Studio makes 'em in the basement. They keep the fat off.
Come on, she's an important columnist! What's the matter? I thought you wanted these people to forgive you.
Well... you could always dump her, Mr. Bebe. Teach her a lesson. There are a million beautiful girls out there who don't give a damn about politics.
Frances Farmer, contract player, six- month option.
That's Frances. I'm not the cookbook.
No, I'm concerned with everything.
Yeah, I mean slacks... and work clothes... and that awful car --
You know what I mean.
Oh my God! Frances, I'm such a cad. I can't go through with this. My wife is in Europe, but this is her house...  her bedroom. I can't ask you to...
What's up?
That's right. I don't want them breathing down my neck while we're in London.
Hey, where's the fire, sister?
Get your clothes on.
Hey, I'm not a complete fool, you know. I can see you're going sour on me, and when I try to do something about it, you turn your back and say it's nothing.
I don't suppose it occurred to you that I might want to leave too, that I might want to do theatre? No, 'cause you don't want me along, do you? And the reason has nothing to do with summer stock.
Oh, God! Let's get her out of here tonight, right now! Let's take her with us!
Doctor, it may sound odd, but I believe I've profited from my stay here. It's just what I've needed, to get away like this. But I'm recuperated now. I've had lots of time to think and I've made a few decisions about my life. I'm ready to get on with it.
...Don't you?
Harry? Oh Harry, I knew you'd come. I love you, Harry. I love... Take me home, Harry.
Thank you, Ralph.
No, no, no. All he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation.
Dad, please, don't leave early. Just because of Mama --
If I didn't, I wouldn't put you through it.
Francie, you know I can't do that.
Dad, here! You don't have to stop, just slow down. You can tell Mama I jumped out. She knows that's the kind of thing I'd do. She won't blame you.
It always amazes me, Lil, how you can whip up a hot, hearty meal out of thin air.
Name?
Age?
Only if you were in it. Are you?
Why?
I'll... take your word for it. So who are you, then?
Oh yeah! I saw you in the newsreel!
Whattaya mean?
Well? What'd you think?
Not bad. It was slow at first, but I'm doing bits now.
Tell you what. Let's ditch the limo. Let me drive you up to that red carpet in my beat up Chevy.
Six months' probation...? You gotta learn when to do battle, Farmer. You're not going to win many bouts with 200 pound cops.
I just wanted to be part of something... one thing, one play or one movie, something that was really fine... memorable. And I could say: I did that, I made something good.
Take a walk, pal.
Ohhh, that's lousy Scotch!
What a man!
There's just one more thing.
It's not too late to keep going, up to Vancouver? Be the smartest thing.
You don't need to screw around anymore. You don't need Dwayne Steele or Odets or your mother. You need me.
Goodbye, Harry. It was very good to see you again.
Where you goin'?
...Is that not true?
Answer the question! Have you driven a car since you were placed on probation?
That's me, Clifford.
'How do I know it's true? You'll get to be the champ. They'll all want you, all the girls! But I don't care. I've been undersea a long time. When they'd put their hands on me I used to say, "This isn't it! This isn't what I mean!" It's been a mysterious world for me! But Joe, I think you're it! I don't know why, I think you're it. Take me home with you.'
It's okay.
And here's one from nice Mr. Zeiss. He says that...
Oh Mama, I'm so... tired of that song.
Nothing. I think I'll just go out for awhile.
Say you promise.
Don't... talk crazy.
Oh, just leave those things for now.
Yes...?
No, my dear. You must be mistaken.
I find these initial meetings to be much easier without the concerned relatives in attendance.
I'm glad to see you haven't lost your sense of humor.
So it seems. May we be serious for a moment?
Normal. Average.
This whole thing is a joke!
Is there something else?
Yeah, well, you know doctors. They sure hate to use that word.
I longed to be with him. But I wanted his final moments to have peace. I could see you were a friend to him.
Why?
Friends? Do they live around here?
Come warm yourself if you like.
Your crime... as well as mine.
Why, Victor? Why? What were you thinking?
What of my soul? Do I have one? Or was that a part you left out?  Who were these people of which I am comprised? Good people? Bad people?
Stolen memories. Stolen and hazy. They taunt me in my dreams. I've seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her. Whose woman was this? I've seen boys playing, splashing about in a stream. Whose childhood friends were these?  Who am I?
Like you? Oh, God, you don't know what you're asking.
And if I consent?
Why... her?
She's beautiful.
GET AWAY FROM HER! SHE'S MINE!
That's the nature of all progress, William. Don't let your brother sway you otherwise.
Must've been a terrible row.
And not a word of them to Father. He's agitated enough not hearing from Victor.
Are you all right?
Have you seen Willie?
What kind of God is He to will this?
Victor, have a care! You'll make him dizzy!
If only I could. But one of us must stay. Father's not strong. Willie's just a child. Who can look after them in your absence? Who can run the estate?
You make me weak.
I give you my soul...
It's going to ram us.
I'm quite serious. Look at all the charity and clinic work we do. Up until thirty years ago, the concept of vaccine was unheard of.
Henry Clerval.
The entire school heard it. It wasn't something one could miss.
What now? Writing about it in your journal won't help.
Now you've got him started.
Only you would think of that!
You can't. Death is God's will!
That's blasphemy!
All the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor!
Thank God your fever broke.  Slowly, now. Just a sip.  I've been worried we might lose you. It's been touch-and-go for a week.
It's the down-and-outs I pity most. Those who can't fend for themselves. They'll be dead by the thousands before this is done. They don't stand a chance out there.
All that I once loved lies in a shallow grave. By my hand.
Yes. I took refuge in the barn. Wouldn't you? Lost in the storm? Freezing and wet? I was exhausted and could search no longer.
Paracelsus?
You seem to be adapting well to the approved curriculum.
Preposterous.
It is a thrilling direction to explore. Thrilling and dangerous.  Nature can be wonderful and terrible. Science is not a realm for the reckless; it needs a conscience. We must proceed cautiously. Assess as we go.  What I do on my own time is my own business. The same holds true for you. You wish to expand your mind? Fine, do so. You can even join me here, if you like. But not at the expense of your normal studies.
"...a sincere and heartfelt apology which you will then read aloud to him before the assembled student body and faculty.
I heard.
He's dead... She's dead... all dead... Please save me... oh... poor Bill... Oh my God, oh my God... oh God...
It's just this place. The storm. That's why you're all upset.
I've got to go to town and pick up the trailer and all that other stuff, but I'll be back around ten. If you're still up, we can talk, okay?
Why don't we run? Just run now?
How come?
You said we were special.
You know what I said, though.
This is almost like the one at my uncle's cabin in Maine.
Thanks.
You just had some lucky shots.
Did anyone ever tell you you're beautiful when you're angry?
No wonder they lost America. How could you sneak around in the bushes wearing that? What's to eat?
Ow!
He keeps on acting like such an asshole!
Don't call him.
This is no dream. Want to escape for a while?
Sex is all you ever think of, Neddy.
Good luck.
How many with you?
What is your purpose in Mexico?
We got about two more hours of day light left. That'll get us into El Paso, which is right next to the border. We'll stop at a motel --
What's this guy's problem?
Who's this?
She's dead?
How'd she die?
Jesus Christ, Pops, don't start with this shit.
Look, dickhead, the only thing you need to be convinced about is that you're stuck in a situation with a coupla real mean motor scooters. I don't wanna hafta worry about you all fuckin' night. And I don't think you wanna be worrying about my brother's intentions toward your daughter all night. You notice the way he looked at her, didn't ya?
Why not, against your religion?
What are you going to do?
I don't know about that. In order for it to have any power, I think it's gotta be an official crucifix.
Well, I say lets tear this place apart for weapons. So when they burst through that door, we'll make 'em wish they never did.
Kate, we don't have all day, so I'm only gonna count to five. One...two... three... four...
We have to go back for Daddy!
How many bullets left, kid?
I'm sorry.
They'll probably make a run for the border, which would bring 'em this way. And if we get our hands on those shit asses, we're talking payback time. We'll get 'em all right. I gotta piss. I'm gonna use your commode.
I never said help us!
What dya mean?
What the fuck was that about?
All I'm saying --
Shit, I started to get worried. Where the fuck ya been?
Richie, it's gonna get a lot fuckin' worse before it gets any fuckin' better. We showed our ass in Texas. We killed Texas fuckin' Rangers. They ain't gonna stop lookin' till they find us, and when they find us, they're gonna kill us. Texans take it very personal when ya kill their law enforcement officers. The El Paso police have already started a motel and hotel search for us.
What'd ya mean, what? The fuckin' woman, the hostage. Where the fuck is she, Richard!?
They're gonna search the van.
I don't know, you just passed out.
What do you mean?
How are you?
B.O.Q., south side.  Take a starboard tack out the door.
Can I ask you somethin', lieutenant? How come you're doing this?  I mean, we're kinda curious.
The woman I saw you with...
Well, seein's how this thing is out, you let me handle the r.p.m.  From this point forward, I want all press matters coordinated via my office. I'll be god-damned if I'm gonna watch Hayes pull flowers out of his ass and take credit for this one. Him or the President.  This my shade?  "Midnight Mahogany"? 'Cuz I'm comin' dangerously close to lookin' like Ronald Reagan here.
Would you care for a beverage?  Tea?
Really, I have no problem with --
None at this time, sir.
Pardon the hour, sir.  But you told me to come to you immediately if I felt I was being mistreated in any way.
Oh, really.
Did you just barge in here and curse at your base commander?  If so, I regard that as a bonafide brain- fart, and I resent it when people fart inside my home.
Straight up?
Aw, what is this...
Fine by me, sir!
Banditos on the east perimeter!  150 yards!  Shit, she was part of it!
The commission concluded that the aviator in question failed to execute a proper approach to the carrier.
"Coronado."
You know him.
Should probably ask him that.
What are you saying?  That a women's life is more valuable than a man's? That a women's death hurts a family more?
Hey.  You okay, Flea?
Come on, Montgomery...
Of course it is.  And I'm gonna stay on her until everyone realizes this is not some bullshit equal-rights thing, that real lives are gonna be lost.  Maybe mine, maybe yours.
I'll try anyway, sir.
Lieutenant O'Neil.
Well, you're doin' shit-hot at Intel.
I'll try to keep the door open.  If you wash out, I make it so that --
Well, not this.  I was doing the Pentagon scene few nights ago.  Got some fresh stuff -- about you.  You may be in a hostile camp.  I think someone may be taking steps to ensure that you crash and burn.
Someone screwed you over like this, left unanswered charges hanging over your head, and you're not gonna fight back?
"Wickwire, Thomas Dane"... Second run at Coronado... and correct, they had him stashed in the "Appropriation Liaison Office," whatever that is.
I'd sure like to know who.
Hey.  Way to gut it out.
Wick.  They got your crew, too?
So the shit you gotta go through? To get from here to there?  Brother said it was worth it.  Worth the training... worth the divorce... worth anything.
Last time I didn't.
Sorry, didn't mean to --
What're you guys doing?  Huh?
She part of the training?
32 feet, six inches!
So we got two full mini-tanks, three minutes each.  'Cool?  How much air in yours?
You are in the cage, O'Neil.  Right here, right now.
Well, I'm trying to figure out if you're stupid, unlucky, gluttonous -- or some new alloy of all three.
O'Neil...
Aw, lookit this, lookit this -- she's bringin' Tampax in here. C'mon, you got nothin' but rooms over there.
WOULD YOU JUST GET OUTTA HERE?
All right, fire-and-evade maneuvers. Drop everything but weapons and the PRC radio -- we're gonna be high speed, low drag all the way to the link-up site.  Ready?
I just wonder how that happened.
You don't suppose this is just part of...
We're fucked.
Subject?
Don't for a second think she didn't leak this story.  "G.I. Jane" gives DeHaven a symbol that taps into the biggest constituency of them all.
If you were the President, wouldn't that put a little piss in your shoes?
Audrey's going to stay with us tonight.
What?
Animal, I can't.
What are you doing?
Don't you think we have enough?
Cut uptown, take 8th to 57th then cut up Broadway.
Audrey?! Is that you? Hi, hello. You look, wow, uh, how've you been?
So you made it.
So, you still picking apart cockroaches?
I didn't mean for it to turn out like this.  Look, I lied to you. I'm not a reporter. When we broke up and I came out to New York I was so sure I'd make it. But I haven't. That's why I needed this story so bad. I just couldn't tell you I'm a failure.
Circuits are overloaded.
Come on, the broadcast booth is right over here.
The network is on an intranet. It's a direct feed into our computer system.
You'd be surprised.
And I'm supposed to remind you to call him on all of Caiman's expense p.o.'s.
Did you talk with Humphries?
I want that story, Audrey. Remember you work for me.
They will set the trap at thirty minutes to ten.
When we learned he could burrow his way through the tunnels we realized he could be out of the quarantined zone.
Who are they? Lieutenant, get those people away from there.
Major, what do you think could have done this?
Look, I may work for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission but accidents and spills are not my field.
The radioactive contamination in that area altered the earthworm's DNA! You have any idea what that means?
Are you looking for this?
It's the French Secret Service.
So why all the secrecy? Why aren't you guys working with the US military?
What's with the chewing gum?
I think we should leave now.
What'd they say?
Okay, Quellek, let's get back to the command deck and-Suddenly we hear a PISTOL BLAST and Quellek's chest turns RED. Alexander and Quellek look down at the blood, horrified.
No, don't talk like that, son. We're going to get you fixed up.
Don't speak, Quellek.
At ease men.
We've got to stop!
What?  What?
ALEXANDER??? PLEASE? You're my advisor, advise me!
It's a DAMN ROCK MONSTER!!! It doesn't HAVE motivation!
Jason, before we entered the black hole, my instruments detected strange energy surge from Sarris' shiD~ similar to...
Not again...
Alex you can't -just leave.
We heard it the first time!
"Go into the cloud! ...
Those blue things ate everybody here?
You said "the Commander.
Back there. You said "the Commander is down there with a bunch of cannibals."
I have sectors 1-28.  I think Hector has the upper levels.
... Yes?
Oh... Oh, I see. Oh.
... But I want you to know that I am not a complete braincase, okay? I understand completely that It's just a TV show. There is no ship, there is no Beryllium Sphere, no diagital conveyor... I mean, obviously it's all just a-
Shit! Go!
Negative. The Beryllium sphere will have to be replaced.
Systems register functional.
... What does that mean?
Covalent... Right. So...
Hey Commander. Listen, we found some Beryllium on a nearby planet. We might be able to get there if we re-configure the solar matrix in parallel for endothermic propulsion. What do you think?
As good as Hopkins?
THAT'S why you built this ship?
I am SO SICK of being right.
How the hell is Fred supposed to project a hologram?
We're screwed... We're so screwed...
It doesn't have to be a hologram... Just a diversion.
There's nobody here. Jason...
Self control?  That's funny coming from the guy that slept with every Moon Princess and Terrakian slave girl on the show!...
Clenched jaw...
Jason.. Can you hear me?
Jason?...  I don't think the pig lizard was Gorignak...
There's no hatch.  There's no hatch!
We shouldn't have to DO this!  It makes NO LOGICAL SENSE! Why is it HERE?
Where the hell is he?  An hour and a half late.  An hour and a half!
Unbelievable.
You know, that's really getting annoying.
JASON  You think you could-get any closer to those mines?
First, I require the Omega 13... Second-
Yes... Hi Sarris... How are you doing?
Right.  Well... Listen, I'm  I'm sorry about that whole... thing.. before. It was kind of a misunderstanding.  I'm sure we can work this out like reasonable people... How's the uh...  ... that going to heal up? God, I hope so, I feel just awful about that.
Explain -
My name is Jason Nesmith. I'm an actor. We're all actors.
Commander, I must speak to you. It is a matter of supreme importance... We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula, and we require your help. I beseech you to come with us, back to our ship. A great many lives hang in the balance...
Sir, I understand this is a terrible breach of protocol, but please, I beg you to hear our plea. We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula.  Our people are being systematically hunted and slaughtered by Roth'h'ar Sarris of Fatu-Krey. Sarris wants the Omega 13. We are to meet in negotiation. However our past efforts in this regard have been nothing short of disastrous. The flames, the death...  Please Captain, you are our last hope.  We have secured a limousine.
How can we thank you, Commander. You- You have saved our people.
"Deception..." "Lies."
Sections of rooms made of plywood. Our Beryllium Sphere was painted wire and plaster. The digital conveyor was Christmas lights... Decorations.  It's all a fake.  I'm not him...  I'm a nothing. A nobody.
That's right... Just keep shaking it out... Here, have some gum, It helps.
Excuse me?
Sorry Guys... It just went off.
Okay... On what?
Let's do it, Tommy.
Some say that Hessians are invincible.
I'm accused of using some government wagons to ship personal property.
They died well.  Otherwise, they didn't do much right.  But if we have war, the British will surely send their best troops:  right now they have no other enemies.
We're in bad shape, Benedict, moral is low.  Before I can do anything, I need Lee and his seven thousand troops.  I've ordered him to join us three times.  In my last letter I all but begged him to come here. The man is insubordinate.
I hope I never have to believe that.
There was this anonymous pamphlet circulated at Congress which says I am personally responsible for all our hardships.  And... that I have encouraged the people of America to make me into a God!  Benedict, it says that I have gone mad!
There's this whispering campaign against me ever since Gates won at Saratoga.
These men were taken from their homes at night, tried by Reed's courts -- which Congress recognizes -- and, well, you can see.
Yes, General.  But if you have to shoot somebody, you can't.
Misunderstood what!?
Me?  You apologizing to me?
No uniforms.  No coats, even?  In this weather?
Negroes?  Washington has black men in his army?  Are they good fighters?  What's that red ribbon on his arm, Colonel?
Captain Alexander Hamilton, sir!
I'm so inclined.
Captain, I want you to know that I respect your openness.  It would make me happy if you'd join our table for dinner from now on.
That young school teacher... I heard the British hung him as a spy.
I want to address the officers, all the officers.  Next Friday.  Can we arrange it at the mess?
With your support, Horatio.  As one of our own who has seen combat with the British, your opinion counts.
Makes you gag.
No one wants another failure right now, God knows.  But people like Arnold and, God knows, I'm having my fears about General Washington.
I doubt Arnold will be afraid.
Did God ever make such a pitiful army?
My God... They mean to finish us. What about Arnold?  He's up there.
No.  As a matter of fact I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about.
What do you mean you're not a Christian?  Of course you're a Christian, we're all Christians...
But the Hessians are there!  No one can beat them!  That's why Cornwallis stationed them there! They have the post of honor!  They are invincible!
George, I'm afraid if you go through with this madness I must tender my resignation as your aide. I see where we're headed, you're putting your trust in the likes of Hamilton and Arnold...
Like flowers after the snow melts.
I can not allow the fortune in slaves my first husband created and what our partnership has elevated, to be destroyed...
It's an anti-Christian dogma!  I cannot believe you are so calm about it!
I certainly didn't mean you.  Of course you are a gentleman, an officer and a gentleman.
They're just disgusting, jealous, bottom-feeding swine.  It's their nature.
Sir, I have to act on instructions from you ordering thirty copies of your own dress uniform...
You remember, George, when we were 'studying' the great philosophers?
We can grow three primary crops in a season and, if we have some luck, we get a forth.  The temperature is generally mild.
Think what the play means, William. Perhaps these words have a place in the real world.
Cranes?  Who needs to walk like a crane?
And to think I am teaching you to become one of them...
I don't laugh at you, George.  I like you.  I like you because you will never, ever make it as an aristocrat... and that's because you're completely incompetent at hiding your feelings.
You hear that?
I reserved a Cadillac.
You're kidding me, right?
And I mean high up in it.  That's why Harry's gonna make Mr. Lovejoy with me, not Chili Palmer.
Who?
After this one, I'm out, Cat, you understand? This is the last time we talk to each other.
Hell, why not just shoot her? Why not shoot everybody. Fuckin' shoot me. Shoot the fuckin' president?
About sixty.
He's my sister's kid. No papa. Not too bright. Personally, I think he's a retard. I only gave him the job as a favor for my sister, you understand?
He comes up here with our product. He suppose to come home with five hundred thousand dollars. He never shows up. Meanwhile, my sister's going crazy calling me all the time worried about him. Me, I just wanna know what happened to my focking money.
Now why would you do that? Put the money in a locker?
He's around someplace.
No shit, come on. How you gonna do that?
I missed that one. Or, hey, you know who else? Morgan Freeman. You know Morgan?
There's Ilona.
Get something going there.
She's great. Gimme the money.
Only this time, no John Wayne and Dean Martin shooting the bad guys in El Dorado.
Harry, you think we go to see your movies? I've seen better film on teeth. Makes no difference to me which one our money's in. So how 'bout you take our twenty points out of "Freaks" and put 'em in this other one, "Mr. Loverboy".
Last night. When he called me over to your office to talk about it.
Assuming I go along with this, when can I have the five hundred?
Who is this? I'm the one telling you the way it is, okay, asshole? That's who I am. Now you want your three hundred grand or don't you?
Where's Leo Devoe? Where's Chili Palmer? Where's my fuckin' money?
How'd you get in here?
The man you're steppin' on belongs to me and my partner.
Get in line, bro.
Tough shit, bro. This ain't Miami. You want something, talk to me.
You a quick draw... 'bro?' You better be, your piece stuck way down in your belt like that.
You live in Miami?
That's the idea. I'll think about it.
Have we met? I don't recall.
Part of it, yeah.
Murray Saffrin, guy who wrote it, did all my Grotesque pictures, had it in a drawer for twenty years. He shows it to me one day, tells me he's got a star interested, would I produce it.
She looks familiar.
The problem is Murray. He and a few other blocked screenwriters went river rafting down the Kern a few weeks ago. Murray never made it back.
You tell me you want these guys off your back. Next thing I know, you're saying yeah, maybe they can have a piece of Mr. Lovejoy. I couldn't believe my fuckin' ears.
Okay, Harry, I'm wrong. You're not the one he's setting up.
Maybe I oughta talk to this Ray Bones character myself. See if he wants to invest in my movie.
Yeah, he told me.
Yeah, Ray, he personally told me he got killed in that Get Away Airlines' jet went down last month.
It was in the Herald.
Which also means when I speak, I'm speakin' for Jimmy. So e.g. as of now, you start affording me the proper respect.
Bullshit. E.g. is short for 'ergo'.
We talk different?
Guy owes me fifteen large and takes off, I go after him. The fuck you think I do?
What you're telling me, you're tired? You wanna go to bed?
The wife sues the airline.  This is a gutsy babe.
I wouldn't think you're that dumb, leave over three hundred grand in the closet, underneath the extra blanket, but I guess you are.
You're here a while, what's wrong with a bank?
The interest is four hundred and fifty dollars a week on fifteen thousand?
You saw that one?
I know I'm better than what I've been doing the last ten years, walking around in a tank top and fuck-me pumps, waiting till it's time to scream.
I think it's not horrible.
That why you came over here, to ask me that?
This thing's actually accurate. I bought it for ten bucks from a kid in a lawn chair on Sunset...
Why not?
Harry, what're you doing? You're supposed to be in the hospital.
You don't act like it?
Hey, Chili.  Get your coat, but don't piss the guy off, okay? It could get complicated and we'd have to call Momo to straighten it out. Then Momo gets pissed for wasting his time and we don't need that.
I hate to say I told you, but I did. I told you don't start nothing with him that time.
Hello, Doris.
Anyone skim the pool? It needs it.
With your experience, you could always become an agent. Right, Harry?
What I'm saying, Harry, is I want you and your new buddy to get out of my house.
Karen. Wow. Look at you...
Lufkin. His... agent.
But you are interested?
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. What type of vessel?
Roger, North Island. I am tied to the passenger vessel Chimera. And she is afloat. Repeat, she is afloat. Over.
Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coastguard Station North Island. Your radio check is affirmative. Over.
Are you crazy? Do you realize we got ourselves a ship? We own a ship, Dodge.
Fucker!
Damn mind of it's own.
What's so great about Sweden?
Roger.
You think that's funny
Last thing we want is extra partners.
What other choices have we got?
Smokes?
Dodge.  Dodge.
It's a bloody navigation hazard. One boat can't control a ship that size.
Mother fucker!
I'm buyin' me a nice outrigger. Spend my time hauling rich Seattle business men through the Puget.
Dreamin's all any of you're gonna be doing if we don't get this boat running.
If somebody's aboard her already, she ain't ours. She's theirs.
What if that fucker finds it before we're ready to go?
Bodies're too fresh.
That'd be my guess.
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?!
I think you know.
Take it easy, willya? What about the radio?!
I didn't touch the fucking radio!  Ever occur to you there's somebody else on that boat, skipper?
What the hell happened!
Tomorrow we'll see if we can't find some line and tackle. Use some of those bodies below decks for bait.
Don't fall asleep.
Looks like one hell of a stick up his ass.
What'd he look like?
Coffee.
Stay away. Or else.
Any dizziness?
You okay?
I can't believe you. Dodge's dead and all you can think about is cashing in your share.
She was sailing up north, right?
Maybe they didn't want it back. Maybe the whole fat deal was insured.
Why not call for help?
Take it easy, you'll live longer.
Got your light?
Murphy to Epps.
Smashed it up pretty bad.
Murphy to Epps.
Greer to Murphy.
The number nine on the starboard side's half flooded. Epps says it's a slow leak just under the waterline, about twenty gallons an hour. They must've pumped it before we left Sitka.
Not bad for dragging a leaky tub half way to Russia.
All we got to do is hit some rough weather and you can forget about it.
Greer?
I say we off-load some of that gold now.
How're you feeling?
What happened?
Last thing I remember I was aboard the Chimera. Down somewhere in there scavenging around.
Gettin' a little hot under the collar, I'd say.
It's a Noaa buoy.
Nobody's going anywhere with that gold now. Anybody tries to board, we'll know about it.  You can do what you want, Greer. But neither of us is gonna risk saving your ass down here if it comes to that.
Will you get off my back for once?
Guess.
Give up?
Pumpkin? What's wrong?
It's nothing -- it's just some hormonal thing... don't worry about it...
What?
I was in a horrible mood - tell her not to worry, I'll be completely out of her life in a few days.
Hey... so, what brings you down here?
I-I honestly never intended for this to happen...
These are all valid comments, but I think we should see if the artist has anything to bring to this.
And how does an image like this help us to see that?
Look, that's the policy... if you want to make up your own rules you can open your own theater...
What the hell is wrong with you?!
Well lose it! And why aren't you pushing the large sizes? Didn't you get training about upsizing?
Well hello there, young employee of the Sidewinder.
So Josh, will you give us a ride? Please? Pretty please? It's going to be super fun!
Jesus, look at this guy.
Hi... what's up?
Are you the one who left that note?
You make me nervous! I always feel like you're going out of your way to make me feel uncomfortable so you can laugh at me!
You must have known all along how I -- you know -- how I felt about you -- it must be totally obvious...  God... I always used to dream about this...
Do you want to go get breakfast somewhere?
Why not?
God, what a bunch of retards...
Since when is she an "actress"?
God, just think, we'll never see Dennis again.
Did you sign up yet?
Much later.
What do you do if you're a satanist, anyway?
Maybe there's some weird secret satanic society that meets at the Quality Cafe and all of the other regular customers are in on it except for us.
I might actually get the pasta special.
What is this?
Is he wearing a green cardigan?
It's obviously him!
He's insane!
This is way too creepy.
I think it's cute - look at his little weasel teeth.
He should totally just kill himself... Hey, here's one  ...Oh wait...  you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats...
"Funky"?
JOSH!
...you don't have to make a million dollars -- just get any stupid job so we can at least start looking for an apartment.
When are you finally going to get your diploma?
Anyway, now we can start looking for the apartment...  Do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment?
I am not -- I just think it'd be funny to see what he'd do...
Just some people from work...
What? When did you see Josh?!
Oh yeah, I can tell you really love it!
You're the psycho! You haven't been able to deal with anything since high school ended!
I'm sorry about the other day. I don't know what's wrong with me... I really do want to move in with you.
So, whaddya think?
You're lucky then, you can't see the veins on that guy's biceps.
What are you going to be when you grow up, Todd?
It's really quite something to see you all grown up like this, Enid.  I'd love to hear about what you're doing. I can't help but feel that I had some small part in how you turned out...  What are you studying? You were always such a smart little girl.
May I ask what you're doing?
Do you have any other old records besides these?
Who does?
If you really want to "fuck up the system" - you should go to business school -- that's what I'm gonna do: get a job at some big corporation and fuck things up from the inside!
...are you waiting for a bus?
Fine, and how are you?
Why do you even want it? It would look stupid on you.
Is this one any good?
No really... I guarantee I could get you a date in like two seconds...
But putting that aside for now, would you go out with her?
I really don't think it's a good idea.
So, why did you bring this along?
We just need to figure out a place where you can meet somebody who isn't a total idiot, that's all.
I'm not sure I have anything to drink... there might be some --
So, I don't really get it -- are you saying that things were better back then  even though there was stuff like this?
I mean, I'm eighteen years old and I've never even had a real, steady boyfriend for more than like two weeks!
Never...
Wow!  What was that all about?
Seymour! I promise you that wasn't a joke -- you have to call her back!
Uh... hello?
Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you... I've been wandering the streets day and night trying to find you...
We really should get together sometime soon... I-I'll definitely call you this week --
No... no, it's just that I should get going in a few minutes, and --
...so... is he your boyfriend now?
Well forget the art show... let's do something else.
No, of course not.
In what way do you mean?
...What do you mean?
What's the matter?
That's Dana's - I'm supposed to be saving it for our two-month anniversary. You better not --
God, she's going to kill me... this bottle is half-empty!
You're a beautiful young girl... I can't imagine you would ever have had any interest in me, except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity.
I used to think about one day not telling anybody and just taking off and going to some random place... Do you ever think about stuff like that?
Who cares? Let's just go... what's stopping us?
Well, here's where the fun never stops!
Where else am I ever going to find another girl who likes Geeshie Wiley records?  She could at least have the decency to call me back.
Please Josh?
I can see that... now what can you tell us about it? First of all, what kind of sculpture is this?
This shocking image of repressed femininity!
Uh... hi. Uh... Enid's stepmother told me I'd find her here?
She just mentioned him a few times and said that they had been dating - I thought maybe she was...
I have no idea - I just want to...
You were contracted to work-
The next time will be as this time- The Devil has come to Tsavo-
No hints, Samuel.
John Henry Patterson, come in. I'm Robert Beaumont.  Firm- I like that, tells me a lot about you-  -now why don't you tell me about me? To get you started, many people find me handsome, with a wonderful smile. I'm sure you agree.  Winning personality, heaps of charm?
You'll need your confidence, I promise you.
Awhile back he ordered some bibles-  -I've brought them.  Is he here?
It's what the natives are calling the lions-  -two lions have been causing trouble-
Are you running a high fever, man? How could you expect something as lunatic as this to succeed? How could you even conceive of it?
You're certain about tomorrow?  But you don't seem excited.
That's a terrible idea-
Finish your tour?
...one shot...
How lucky we are.
Actually, no.
I don't really. But understand something- even though it may take me two or three days to sort this out-  -when I'm gone, you'll still have to build the bridge. And I don't want the men to have lost respect for you.
They're used to people in trees, not in a clearing.  It may be tight.
How many do you think they've killed?
I never thought I'd say this, but I'm glad you came.
Did it look like this in your mind?
We should construct thorn fences around every tent area. Fires burning at night.
Do you love her?
Where is it?
Every day I ask you, and every day you've got something else to do.  Do I have bad breath or something?
This is my address and telephone number. Will you call me?
He ditched you.  You should've married me, you know.
Men are very sensitive, you know.  We need to feel loved and desired, too.
His name is Oscar.
So this is what you do, huh?
He was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman. I hate this painting.  I've felt very uncomfortable since they brought it up from storage.
I'm sorry.  Were you on your way out?
I'm not here to date.  I can't leave Oscar in a strange place with someone I don't know.
Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow, or could you hold off for a few days maybe?
Sorry!
It's really not a bad place.  It just needs a woman's touch.
You're really good with children, Louis.  I can tell.  Why don't you come here and sit with me?
I'm not sure this is such a good idea?  Do they know you're doing this?
Dr. Venkman?  Dana is not here.
You know, I never got to ask you.  Where you from, Johnny?
You pitiful, miserable creatures!  You dare to challenge the power of darkness?  Don't you realize what you are dealing with?  He's Vigo!  You are like the buzzing of flies to him.
I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia, the sorrow of Moldavia, command you.
I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia --
-- the sorrow of Moldavia --
That's it?  That's all you have to say?
I got you out of those bad tax shelters.
I fixed you up with Diane Troxler and she put out, didn't she?
Egon!
What now, Brainiac?
That's a thousand million electron volts.
You were supposed to help me with this.
"Vigo the Carpathian, born 1505, died 1610 --"
You know, animals and lower life forms often anticipate major disasters.  Given the new magnetheric readings we could see a tremendous breeding surge in the cockroach population.
So far so good.
From where -- Neptune?
This one's interesting.  Berlin, 1939, a flower cart took off by itself and rolled approximately half a kilometer over level ground.  Three hundred eyewitnesses.
Six feet -- seven -- eight --
Who?
Who?  Who?  Who?
Well, Holmes, what do you think?
Careful, Winston.  He's a mean one.  And to celebrate our grand reopening, we're giving you twice the value with our special half-price 'Welcome Back' service plan.
This is what you do with your spare time?
Don't tell me, let me guess.  All-you-can-eat barbecue rib night at the Sizzler?
I think we're going to have to pass on the sewer trip, boys.  Let me know what you find out.
You should've been there, Venkman. Absolutely incredible!
I hope we have enough stuff to do the job.
Does it have any favorites?
Are you all right?
You better watch your mouth, man, or I'll punch your lights out.
Ray -- Ray -- How do you feel, man?
It better not start yet.  I'm trying to finish my potholder before lunch.
And pure --
Now where are you going?
Hello.  I'm Peter Venkman.  May I help you?
You're quite a housekeeper.
Damn!
I'm a qualified psychologist.  I've got a degree and everything.  I believe that something happened here and I want to do something about it.
I want to help you.
Okay, okay.  But if anything else happens, you have to promise you'll call me.
Okay.  Then I'll go.
You're the best one in your row.
Who's the stiff?
You must have gotten the last copy.
He is the Destructor.
Do you want this body?
Actually, it's more of a policy than a rule.
Hello, I'm Roger Delacorte - the Head Librarian.  Are you the men from the University?
What's that got to do with it?
That's very fascinating to me.  I read a lot myself.  Some people think I'm too intellectual.  But I think reading is a fabulous way to spend your spare time.  I also play racketball.  Do you ever play?
In the physical sense.
I want you to have this.
It's a souvenir from the 1964 World's Fair at Flushing Meadow.  It's my lucky coin.
Keep it anyway.  I have another one at home.
Here's the paper on the Brooklyn job.  She paid with a Visa card.
Heavens, no!  The owners don't like us to even talk about it.  I hoped we could take care of this quietly tonight.
I see.  And now you catch ghosts?
And would this storage facility be located on these premises?
And may I see this storage facility?
And what is the magic word, Mr. Venkman?
Well, because I'm curious.  I want to know more about what you do here.  Frankly, there have been a lot of wild stories in the media and we want to assess any possible environmental impact from your operation. For instance, the storage of noxious, possibly hazardous waste materials in your basement.  Now either you show me what's down there or I come back with a court order.
You turned off the power!  Look, there was another man here ... You have to find him and bring him back.  A short determined-looking guy with the eyes of a happy zombie.
The man is a psychopath, Your Honor.
Yeah, but I didn't know you were going to give me electric shocks.  What are you trying to prove?
Generally, you don't see that kind of behavior in a major appliance.  What do you think, Egon?
Trust me.  It will be bad.
It's Peter, Egon.  I've got a problem.
He wants to shut down the storage grid.
Who?
On the count of three!  One ... Two ...
You know, Peter, this could be a past life experience intruding on the present.
I've got to sleep.
Excuse me for a minute.  Ray, I'm right in the middle of something here.  Can you come back in about an hour?
Well, I was at an unexplained multiple high-altitude rockfall once.
I told you it's real.
Anything!  Just make contact.
This is like a major disgrace.  Forget M.I.T. or Stanford now ... they wouldn't touch us with a three-meter cattle prod.
Boy, that was a rough one.
AND YOU CAME UP WITH THAT?
Very impressive resume.  Electronic countermeasures, Strategic Air Command ... Black belt in Karate ... Small arms expert ... Mr. Zeddemore, as you may have heard, we locate ghosts and spirits, trap them with streams of concentrated quantum energy and remove them from people's homes, offices and places of worship.
Me, too.
Ray, do you remember something in the Bible about a day when the dead would rise up from their graves?
Yeah, Judgement Day.
Where are we now, Commodus?  Can you see the camp?  My Gods!  The air is turning into ice!
Those are priceless sculptures.
How about in the forum.  Right in front of the Senate.
For the gods, spit it out!
Kill him!  Tribuus -- execute that bastard.
Where have you been?
What is that... wailing?
Now that we're done with that infatuation forever.
"... encased in the armor of a demigod, Narcissus The Good continues his impossible climb in the arena where he was unjustly cast..."
Damn him!  I should have killed him on the front -- I let you talk me out of that.
I back Rome against all her enemies -- if that answer disappoints you, I'm not a politician...
I'm ordering a general stand-down in preparation for withdrawal back across the Danube.
Where is my family?
Endorse me in public.  Do that and I'll make you rich and set you free. I'll return your estates.  I know you would give anything to be outside again.  Endorse me and you will be free.  Think of it.  What would you do with your freedom?
Caesar, ignore them.
Gods of hell!  This must cost a fortune!  How many days is this going to go on?
Throw it down into the streets! Down into the Forum.  If it's my father they want then give him to them!
So am I.
Yes, Caesar?
Tribuus!  Go left here, I want to see my new statue at Via Claudia.
Cos, what in hades is the emperor up to?  And don't tell me you don't know!
I've read of it.
Is this Rome?  Are we just going to be executed?
Twenty years I've led men to die. For me it was the glory of Rome. But that was something.  If it wasn't that, then it was the pay or the loot of the next whore -- but that was something!  These men here are butchered for laughs!  Their lives are like jokes delivered in the back alley theaters where their death is a punch line!
Commodus, it's we who are going on the offensive.
I've made so many mistakes, Narcissus.  We all put off the very last duties of our lives because we're afraid of admitting when our lives are over.
It's not because he's young, it's because he's ignorant and arrogant. His sister is a better man.  That's why I have undertaken to begin sweeping changes in the relationship between the emperor and the Senate.
As soon as I can.
On his death bed I promised Marcus I would complete our work here.  The Senate may be vacillating, but I have the army behind me.  I'm taking half a cohort and restocking that fort.
You brought the army into Rome.
Then give the empire back to the people... the children who will grow up to become senators...
The battle is over.  The war is over.  You've won!
Very fancy.  Did you design the bottle?
You're a legate in the Roman army. Huh...?  and you act like one. What was your crime?
Who the hell are you?
General, hang on... drink slowly. You are blessed by the Gods to have a physician and a Divine of Janus with you tonight.  A fan sent them to you.
It will be good luck for you to wear that helmet... It belonged to Cimon of Smyrna... he was crushed by an elephant.
So, things change.  The government has moved to the circus.  You're going to fight last.  And Commodus is going to fight first.
Hello.
You're living at home now. Is that right?
Do you know what you're going to do?
Are you going to graduate school?
Do you always drive like this?
Aren't you eating?
Benjamin -- do you dislike me for some reason?
Will you take me home now?
I think I'd better go home now please.
I want to go home.
Is anything wrong?
With a family?
Benjamin -- what's happening?
What is it?
Benjamin -- you're -- I don't know what to say -- you're --
No. I want to know why you're here in Berkeley?
She said she was having a drink in the hotel with a friend. You waited for her in the parking lot and told her she was too drunk to drive home and that you would get her a room for the night.
Don't you have it on?
The marble?
Are you going home?
You won't?
But you might.
How about tomorrow? I don't mean to be pushy but --
Well -- I have to see Carl first.
Carl who?
How did he do it? Did he get down on his knees? He didn't get down on his knees, I hope.
Ben -- I just want to say one word to you -- just one word --
Are you listening?
Yes, I will.
One of those outside agitators.
What did you do to her?
Look -- I'll give you ten dollars for a dime -- I'll give you twenty -- for God's sake, will you let me use that phone?
I'd rather not.
Hello.
Where are you?
Where are you?
Did you get a room?
What?
Where is your luggage?
How are you, Benjamin?
Benjamin, I want to ask you something.
You don't?
I want you to come in till I get the lights on.
Would you mind walking ahead of me to the sun porch. I feel funny about coming into a dark house.
What do you drink? Bourbon?
All right then.
Sit down, Benjamin.
No.
Oh my God.
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.
Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive me for what I just said?
I don't remember her as having brown eyes.
Then why do you keep running away?
But I just -- Look -- what if Mr. Robinson walked in right now?
Benjamin -- I want you to know I'm available to you. If you won't sleep with me this time --
If you won't sleep with me this time, Benjamin, I want you to know you can call me up any time you want and we'll make some kind of arrangement.
Hello, Benjamin.
Why don't you get it.
I got a single room.
You what?
Are you afraid of me?
You can admit that, can't you?
Oh my God.
Leave it on! Now we are going to do this thing. We are going to have a conversation. Think of another topic.
Art. That's a good subject. You start it off.
Then why do you want to talk about it?
Him?
We're talking.
Now. You say the driveway's on your side of the house. So I guess you don't sleep in the same room.
Well how long has this been going on.
You have not slept with your husband for five years?
How many times a year.
Well how do you feel about him, then?
Well I can't.
A Ford! A Ford! Goddamnit, a Ford! That's great!
Well -- I guess I'll have to ask her out on a date and find out what's --
I'm not good enough for her to associate with, am I? I'm not good enough to even talk about her, am I?
You go to hell. You go straight to hell, Mrs. Robinson. Do you think I'm proud of myself? Do you think I'm proud of this?
No sir. I am not proud that I spend my time with a broken-down alcoholic!
Because -- Mrs. Robinson this is the sickest, most perverted thing that ever happened to me. And you do what you want but I'm getting the hell out.
That I'm a sick and disgusting person.
Benjamin, I want to apologize to you if that's the impression you got.
Yes. Please. I want you to.
Mrs. Robinson --
I don't believe you.
I say I've got it.
The toothbrush. I got it all right.
Benjamin? I'm going to ask you something but you don't have to tell me if you don't want.
Why did you say that?
I'm not. But I'm -- I'm not very proud of what I do. I usually get kind of drunk. I usually drive over to Los Angeles and go to some bars and get kind of drunk. Then I take a hotel room. So I won't have to drive home on the freeway. I mean it kind of scares me to drive home after --
It's pretty embarrassing. I really don't know what to tell Mr. Robinson. It's awkward and strained for me every time he suggests that you call up Elaine.
I'm just --
Would you mind telling me then -- what were those four years of college for? What was the point of all that hard work?
I drove -- I drove Mrs. Robinson home. She wanted me to drive her home so I -- I drove her home.
Here. It looks like you need a refill.
What?
Is anything wrong? You look a little shaken up.
Sir?
Oh say -- Elaine gets down from Berkeley on Saturday.
Hello.
Do you want -- do you want to try and tell me why you did it?
I am not threatening you.
I am trying to tell you I have no personal feelings about you, Mr. Robinson. I am trying to tell you I do not resent you.
Listen to me. We got -- we got into bed with each other. But it was nothing. It was nothing at all. We might -- we might just as well have been shaking hands.
-- before he does --  You're disappointing them, Ben. You're disappointing them.
The floor clerk is out there in the corridor -- she sees everything ---
No -- no -- no -- no...
I don't like your tone.
Get out and leave it to me... be ready to leave on the night train for Amsterdam...
I'm not going to get those pearls and neither are you.
He must be very nice.
You?
Oh!
Lord no -- charming -- but why one meal a day?
Yellow Room where they dance --
You were very different yesterday.
Oh -- there's no real thing -- it doesn't exist.
Well -- such is life, Flaemmchen.
Don't cry -- it tears my heart to see you sob like that.
Why do you look at me like that?
Alone. All alone.  Oh, you strange -- strange creature.
Not quite strange now. It is as if I had been expecting you. You know, once when the Grand Duke was alive, I found a man hiding in my room -- a young officer --
I see -- you do only what you take pleasure in doing. You take pleasure in coming into a woman's bedroom and you come. You take pleasure in a dangerous climb onto a balcony, so you do it... And what is your pleasure now?
Why do you smile?
And?
But now, you must go... I give you the pearls. But now you must go ---
Very early in the morning.
I'll give you what you need -- I have money.
You must go now. Be careful on your way to your room.
No! I can't explain now. Oh, look -- the pearls. You wear them now...
Till then.
Thank you, sir.
Perhaps this evening, Baron, we could go to the Casino -- the place we passed with the marvelous bright lights?
Drink to me, Kringelein -- it's my last chance.
I take five hundred.
Here -- here it is. Here's your pocketbook, Kringelein.
You're all right now -- it's very late -- goodnight, Kringelein.
Well -- last night was not so good.
My dear sir, I would gladly change rooms with you.
Pardon me, the lady has urgent business here with me.
I think it would be much better if you went away.
For me?
News? Yes -- killing in number one- sixty-four.
Any letters?
I came here from a long distance to stay at the Grand Hotel. I want a room -- a big room -- like you would give General Director Preysing -- I'm as good as Mr. Preysing -- I can pay like Mr. Preysing -- would you give him a little room, way up in the corner with the hot water pipes going -- bang -- bang -- bang...
Yes -- yes -- I am tired. I have been ill...
You will stay, Doctor -- if you have nothing better to do?
Life is changing you, Mr. Kringelein.
You must learn as quickly as your time allows -- Believe me Mr. Kringelein, a man who isn't with a woman is a dead man.
Over -- over so soon -- it has just begun.  Oh, the pain.
There is no pocketbook here... On the floor probably.
You've nothing to fear, Kringelein
I'm sure this beautiful room must appeal to your taste -- distinctive, don't you think? Velvet upholstery -- 'A-number one'. I'm in the textile trade and I know.  And these are real silk drapes.
Good evening, Mr. Kringelein -- Where's the Baron?
Dance then?
He was in desperate straits. He'd been trying to raise money all day. He laughed -- Poor devil! And then a man like Preysing kills him.
Yes, of course, -- money!
Wherever you like. Here I'll give you the money I won, three thousand four hundred. Later you can have more.
Am I!
Moreover...
Don't misunderstand me. I'm a married man -- with grownup daughters. Uh --
Not too quickly.
Is that Mrs. Preysing.
Oh, yes, Mr. Preysing?
Insolent young cub!
You're sweet.
There's a lot of business to be done with the Manchester Cotton Company. They've the whole English market right in their hands. Have you any connections with -- Manchester?
If you actually have news from Manchester then...
See you soon, Preysing. Next week we'll meet and discuss further details.
Madam should sleep.
Oh! Madam is cancelling the engagement. Madam has chosen a funny time for such a funny joke. Ha, ha, ha -- hurry, come on. Tonight -- there's a line in front of the theatre since six o'clock. The house is jammed to the roof.
Suzette -- I told you not to bring the pearls. I will not wear them tonight.
Hurry, Suzette.
Will Mr. Kringelein kindly register.
I wish you a very good evening, Mr. Preysing. You are staying here, too, Mr. Preysing?
Oh -- the Baron -- the Baron.
Her room -- oh -- I see, Mr. Preysing -- I understand, Mr. General Director Preysing.
We will wait.
Ach! Here you are, Doctor Zinnowitz.
What do you want with her?
You ever hear about the oranges?
It can louse up your insides. You can get puh, puh, puh...
Almost forgot. That ten grand of yours. It's in the envelope by the door.
Your kid's in the back here. He's crying.
Come on, kid, let's see if there's any food in the house.
Evening. Welcome to Phoenix.
Right in front of the room.
Want a look?
You ruined me! You destroyed me!
Here you are! Two rich people!
His blood pressure is under a hundred. I don't think he'll live to get to the hospital.
Bobo wants you to go on to Delmar.
I hope you're not too badly disappointed with us, Mrs. Langtry.
Well, I'd have to see it, of course.
Kaggs. Home office.
You're right. I apologize. But I still want to talk to you.
When I said you being the best salesman here didn't say much, I meant for us. I know your record with Sarber and Webb, and I'd say you're a top-flight man, but you've had no incentive. No one walking on your heels. Just a lot of half asses, so the tendency's been not to stretch yourself. I'm bouncing the slobs, incidentally.
Sounds like a good Idea.
And I'm Perk. Short for Percy, I'm afraid.
A well-rounded life. I respect that. But it has to have a center, Roy, something you care about, something you can think about.
Don't mention it.
What happened to your hand?
I can take care of my own bills, Lilly.
Not as tough as you, huh?
If you come out to the track, don't know me.
Roy, I don't want money from you.
You ought to put a bandage on that.
I thought... I was hoping we could play it straight with one another.
Well, sure, Roy. You want me to drive up --? Okay, fine, come on down.  It won't be a home-cooked meal, you know.
Looks very solid, Lilly. Sit down. Take a minute, tell me about it.
I wouldn't go in on a deal with her. She blamed you for it.
I sat in there with her, I thought, what do I do now? Run and I've got Bobo and the law after me. Stay, and how do I explain?
At what?
Roy, I know what to do with myself! It's a big world out there.
You don't know what I'd do, Roy. You have no idea. To live.
I know what's bugging you, of course.
I wonder did you ever think about it from my side.
That's good. You don't really belong on this side of the fence, you know.
If I should get out of the racket, that goes double for you. That's why you've got to change your life completely, go to some town, get a square job, live like a john yourself. If you try to do it your way, what future is in it?
There's nothing more to talk about.
I can't. I just left home.
You aren't taking me for granted, are you?
The tap. What you do for a living.
You talk the lingo. What's your pitch?
Upstate.
I still don't see why we have to have separate rooms. You expect your father to come through?
Yeah?
) The track? Did you run into Lilly?
You must have some very knowledgeable friends.
The last I looked, we were just talking things over.
By God, it's your mother. It's Lilly.
You watch that mouth.
Roy Dillon?
Lieutenant Pierson, Phoenix police. I have a car here.
I'm sorry, it was her all right. Her gun, even.
I grant you, it's a little odd, shoot yourself with a gun with a silencer on it, but it was hers, all right. It really is your mother, Mister Dillon.
Do you have any particular reason to say that?
What?
Not many laughs in this room, eh?
Why am I here?
Impressive, Blake.  Where'd you learn how to do that?
Come on, Carter.  You know it's Michael.
Carter.
I'll be damned.
Another historical inaccuracy.
Nothing to fear.  The coast is clear.
Totally.  I checked all the rooms and closets...
You some kind of fugitive or something?
Why didn't you tell me?
What?  Where is she?
Yeah, me too, Keri.
Not me.
Nah, I didn't tell her where I went.
Are you crazy?  You'll get caught.
Still wants to move out?
What are you looking at?
So you're really Michael Meyers' sister?
Fuckin' A.
Better her than me.
I'll pop a Benadryl.
Whatever happened to women in back?
Home is here in Grandma and Grandpa's new house.  At least while I'm in college. Remember our deal.
No, Mom -- keep it on!
I'm getting the children out of here. At least until we know what we're dealing with.  John, I want you to come with us.
This house is sacred to him.  It's the source of his memories -- his rage.  Mrs. Strode, I beg you.  Don't let your family suffer the same fast as Laurie and her daughter.
God ... this can't be true.
Runes were a kind of early alphabet that originated in Northern Europe thousands of years ago.  They were symbols -- carved out of stone or pieces of wood.  Of all the runes, Thorn had the most negative influence. Cults used them in blood rituals to portend future events and invoke magic.
Halloween.
Danny!  Danny, where are you?!
Christ, what a night!  Not even so much as a sign for five miles on that road!
Where's the child?
Your madness is another man's greatness.  This is the way things have always been.  You've just been too blinded by your own reality to see.  But having you on the outside has been convenient for us in many ways.  You always did come through -- our loyal watch dog. Finding him. Bringing him back to us once he'd finished his work.  Although after you had that nasty stroke the last time, I had to go after him myself.  And what a terrible time we had getting him out of that jail cell.
No!!!
Yes?
I'm sorry, but do I know you --
A bitch.
It appears that we're going to have to wait awhile for any more action here, Colonel.  Why don't you run on home while the evening's young.
Home.
I didn't tell you everything.
Thank God we found the fucking diamonds!
You were rich before.  This is the first time I was ever rich.
When I drive it, I feel like I'm in the middle of a great big wad of bubblegum.  I don't hear anything, I don't feel anything.  I figure somebody else is driving.  It's a bitch.
Months?
I've been looking at motorcycles.
What's funny about that?
You told me.
I wouldn't want to be married to me. We're too crazy.  You know?
I didn't like that violin thing. That was sad.
You never played a violin.
Okay.  Okay.
I wanted to apologize.
Would somebody please pass me the catsup?
I'm interested in long-term expectations.
We got to get another pilot.
What went wrong?
No matter what you say to me, I still think you're the greatest guy I ever knew.
Anybody home?
Hello.
You think you could find me a pencil and paper?
Big ones, little ones, teeny-weeny ones--just and otherwise.
As in "Death, where is thy sting?" He killed at least fifty men, wounded hundreds more.
Hid by day--fought by night.  At sunset one day, your father and I, peering through field glasses, saw a black Mercedes draw up to a village inn.  It was escorted by two motorcyclists and an armored car.  Out of the Mercedes stepped one of the most hateful men in all of history--the Beast of Yugoslavia.
Don't care for cold steel?  A knife is worse than a bullet?
Mhravitch.  Remember that name.
The name will live forever.  It was there that Harold Ryan slew the Beast of Yugoslavia.  Mhravitch.
The Germans shot everybody who lived there, then leveled it, plowed it, planted turnips and cabbages in the fertile ground. They wished revenge for the slaying of the Beast of Yugoslavia.  To their twisted way of thinking, your father had butchered an Eagle Scout.  Play lots of contact sports?
He seems to think they are.  He told me that were.
You're a very good boy to respond that way.
I'd like to use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
She was on her way home from a meeting of the African Violet Society, and they got her.
Can I get dressed first?
Gee whiz, Dad--
Then speak, by God!  Can you fight with words?
Get mad!  Tell me you don't like the way I treat your mother!  Tell me you wish I'd never come home!
I'm engaged.
This is crazy.
How do you do?
You were well adjusted to my being dead?
What sort of time period do you have in mind?  Half an hour?  An hour?
Your old beau?
You know what I want?  I want you both to be friends.  I know you both, respect you both. You should be friends.
Please--
Honeymoon!  Honeymoon!  Say it: Honeymoon!
You used to like it stark!
I'm going to touch your shoulders very gently now.  You mustn't scream.  So tense, so tense.
You're thinking with your brain instead of your body.  That's why you're so tense!  Forget Norbert. Relax.  It's body time.
I have some change!
Chow, chow, chow!  God damn it-- nutriment!
Tell me about its sexual roots.
And no one's there now?
That's too bad.  I would rather have him at home--to see what I'm going to do.
He did his best to destroy my most precious possession, which is the high opinion women have of me.  I'm now going to even that score.  I'm going to break in his door and I'm going to smash his violin.
I came for Paul as well.
Unless she has nerve.
He had hoped that someone would be playing it still--two hundred years from now.
Last I heard, his mother was going alone.
An Indian narcotic we were forced to drink.  It put us in a haze--a honey-colored haze which was lavender around the edge.  We laughed, we sang, we snoozed.  When a bird called, we answered back. Every living thing was our brother or our sister, we thought. Looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long, and we cried.  We had a funeral that went on for five days--for the cockroach!  I sang "Oh Promise Me." Can you imagine? Where the hell did I ever learn the words to "Oh Promise Me"?  Looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a B-36.  All the time we were drinking more blue soup, more blue soup!  Never stopped drinking blue soup.  Blue soup all the time. We'd go out after food in that honey-colored haze, and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender.
Norbert--you come, too.  Let him go, Harold.  Let him go.
Can I--uh--help you gentlemen?
I mean--I can't leave you here. You'll have to go.  I'll tell Mrs. Ryan you were here.  You can come back later.
You wish the woman good luck, and you tell the man how fortunate he is.  That's how it goes.
How was the emergency, Doctor? Profitable, I hope.
I feel the same way.  What next?
None.
Ah!  You're ambulatory!
Well now--what seems to be the trouble with the patient today?  A touch of malaria, perhaps?
Pacqualinincheewa root.  Means "cougar fang." Cures anything but a yellow streak down the back.
I thought she was a widow.
What brought you back?
A living fossil!  Like the cockroaches and the horseshoe crabs.
Hands and knees, you say?
I love you!  Have a cigar!
You hope.
No quarter asked.  No quarter given.
I see.
Here.  Finish the job.
Don't shoot.
Give me your word of honor that that's all you're going to do.
She married an accountant named Stanley Kestenbaum.
For what?
Who's dead?
How horrible.
I'm only ten years old.
You want to join the Harold Ryan Fan Club?  Wear a pink jacket with a yellow streak up the back?
I worship your father.  That stuffed alligator your mother gave me--the one he shot?  It's the proudest thing in my apartment.
A lot of people don't.
What?
It's fine!
It came yesterday.  I haven't opened it yet.
He isn't?
I was captain of the wrestling team at Lehigh University.
If you want to wrestle, you got Lehigh.  If you want to play tennis, you go to Vanderbilt.
I'm touched.
What then?
Is he all right?
Is he coming home?
Thank you, Herb.  You're a wonderful man.  You really are. Everybody respects you for what you've done for scouting and the Little League.
You were wonderful.
I am Dr. Norbert Woodly--a physician, a healer.  I find it disgusting and frightening that a killer should be a respected member of society.  Gentleness must replace violence everywhere, or we are doomed.
I never knew when to hold it--or who to ask, or what to say.
We've got to dump Shuttle.  He brings his vacuum cleaner on dates?
I wish Paul luck.
They didn't murder me.
He can make the sound of human footsteps--which is a terrifying sound.
If he is in the park, luck is all that can save him now, and there's plenty of that.
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Get out of here.
You fool, you fool.
Do it!
Or get eaten alive.
Phooey.
The late Mrs. Harold Ryan.
Kid--kid--
If he'd just get into scouting, and camp out some, and see how everybody roughhouses around the fire--
Lewis Carroll, who wrote Alice in Wonderland, plays shuffleboard.
I'm sorry, Mr. Brown. I'm sure you're very good, but at the moment, I've got nothing for you. If something comes up, we'll give you a call.
No, Felice, I'm not a cop. In fact, right now I've got as little respect for the police as you do.  I'm looking for a girl. A runaway. I need someone to help me.
What do you mean?
Hello. You want some information?
I don't know no Tod.
Yeah. He's a nice guy. Don't lose him. Maybe we could tone down this stripe a bit. It's a little...
No. I saw her with Tod.
Where is she?
When do we start?
Of Joanne's?
Don't knock it. A girl can save up a lot money doing this -- big money. Then you're free. You can go off to Europe, meet somebody, get married. My girlfriend's going to buy her own beauty parlor. Not me. I'm gonna travel. 'Keep movin' that's my motto.  Would you rather work at Copper Penny at a dollar-eighty an hour, having every two-bit cocksucker able to yell at you? I can make more money suc... doing what I do for five minutes than I can all week at another job.
How important do you think sex is?
You have to believe in something. What do they believe in -- the Whatjamacillit church?
Do they believe in reincarnation? I believe in reincarnation.
Yeah, yeah, go on.
Be that as it may. U is for Unconditional Election. God has chosen a certain number of people to be saved, The Elect, and He has chosen them from the beginning of time. L is for Limited Atonement. Only a limited number will be atoned, will go to Heaven.
I is for Irresistible Grace. God's grace cannot be resisted or denied. And P is for the Perseverance of the Saints. Once you are in Grace you cannot fall from the number of the elect. And that's the 'TULIP.'
Out of gratitude for being chosen. That's where Grace comes in. God first chooses you, then allows you, by Grace, to choose Him of your own free will.
Yeah.  Well, mostly.
Rot in hell, honey.  He's busy now.
I wouldn't expect too much. I mean about her coming back. Once a girl gets into the life.
Listen, Niki. My daughter's been missing five months. I've gone through a lot to find out what's happened to her. I just saw a girl killed. I will not let Tod slip out of my hands. You have to tell me where he is.
You are.
I've got a meeting...
I don't know.
Have you ever seen any, ah, pornographic movies, Jake?
It was called 'Slave of Love' when I bought it. Next time it's sold, it'll be called something else.
But this is my apartment.
You sure as hell haven't been any help.
Why don't you tell me something for a change?
You want to go for coffee after we send the girls off?
Is Marsha there?
Jim Sullivan. Sometimes they call me Jism Jim.
Oh yeah? I remember that. It was made by some college kids.
I hear you got money to spend.  I hear you're interested in... interesting things.
What do you want?  Do I know you from somewhere?
Who the fuck knows? The Four Aces. He goes there.
You don't want anything for your fifty cents?
No. I walked up. Don't ride elevators.
I've got fifty thousand dollars to invest.
Sounds all right.
I don't suppose you've ever seen this girl before either? Her name's Kristen, but I suppose you've never seen her?
Hold it, mister.
The guy who bought you that ring.
I ain't ever gonna see him again anyway.
Hey, piss-head, what brings you around?
Look again, Billy-boy. This is jail bait. Could get you in a lotta trouble.
You remember me. Louise? Rhymes with squeeze.
Eh, Poli Sci?
Come again.
Took it?
Edith was just telling me about her job.
Yes. Henderson Feed and Grain.
Sorry I'm late.
Oh, of course. What is your name?
Do you dance?
Yearse!
Sort of.
No.
A self-portrait.  But over here is my favorite. It's titled "Rainbow with Egg Underneath and an Elephant." Do you like it?
What do you think?
That's a nice teapot.
Why do you say that?
The universal language of mankind.  What music do you like, Harold?
Oh, my. We're too late.
A little after-dinner liqueur, Harold?
What's that?
Okay?
Don't you think we should turn off the heat?
This is really nice. Makes me feel like a kid. I want to do somersaults .
But they have.
You sure have a way with people.
Supper for two.
It's all right. It's organic.
Oh, Harold, don't upset yourself so.
Please, don't you realize? She is dying.
Mother.
I'm getting married.
I'm going to marry the woman I love.
This is insane.
Would you like a cigarette?
Do you play?
I put a lot of effort into these things.
And a lot of time.
You mean when I'm not working on a...
I see. Junkyards. What is the fascination there?
You don't seem to be listening. I asked do you have any friends?
Would you care to talk about this friend?
I see.  Were you happy at school, Harold?
We are not relating today, Harold. I sense a definite resistance. A lack of true and helpful communication. I find you a very interesting case, Harold, but this reluctance of yours is detrimental to the psycho-analytical process, and can only hinder the possibility of effective treatment. Do you understand?
Well, you'll soon have stories like that to tell of your own.
It's the greatest excitement in the world.
How about hand-to-hand combat?
Boy, to think I could maybe make my own.
Parasite!
Harold, calm down! This is...
Oh, Kirsty; so eager to play, so reluctant to admit it.
I want to go back!
I... I had a visitor.
Don't worry about it. Your attitude sucks anyway.
The box. I need the box.
I don't know, Kyle. You're the fucking expert. Now get out of the way!
I've got to finish it.
But it's true, he is his own Hell. Just as you are in yours.
Wait!
Nonsense, I...
Hey. Stinky. Kitchen's closed.  Whatcha havin'? Six library guards, raw? Plus belts and boots? Man, you're gonna need some heavy fiber to move that out --
You were burned by some organic acid.
That's all for you, Sammy.
You are a Catholic??
Do you believe in hell?
These freaks, Trevor, they give me the creeps. And I'm not the only one. You're up for review. You and your petting zoo.
Well, I won't be around forever, you know?
How many buildings does she have to burn? She belongs here!
They took his name from this little inscription that was stuck on his tank.
How does he know so much about me?
On the desk, yes. In Latin.
"In absentia luci, tenebrae vinciunt..."
Well, you did break out --
They're not speaking. Professor Broom had him grounded.
Sir, may I go first??
No, it doesn't make it right, but I stopped that creature, didn't I?
What are you, a Boy Scout?
Mmmh -- "Pamcakes." We're going out --
Hey. You: think twice --
Nah, sounds too "needy."
Anything else you --
Are you sure about this?
You better have that looked at.
Out? Out out?
Okay, someone's expecting us. Turn on your locators -- Anyone sees anything...
He -- loves you.
What about you?
Christ!
It's my lucky day.
Will you sign for the bed?
Alright, let's give it another try.
That your daughter?
Got her mother's looks.
The box... you opened it. We came.
He doesn't see us, or hear us. We belong to you, Kirsty. And you to us.
No time for argument.
Nobody escapes us.
Just in time.
Please. Get back into bed.
Please listen to me --
Well the police are going to want to speak to you. You know that.
You're Julia, right?
I'm hurting
My nerves... are beginning to work again.
Later.
I want an explanation first. I want to know what happened to you.
Don't touch it. It's dangerous. It opens doors.
I was bored. I'd done everything. I'd gone to the limits. There was nothing left to experience. At least nothing I could buy on earth.
Sure. Somewhere safe.  Safe. Christ! They tortured me here. In this room.
That's probably her now. Or the police.
There's a towel in the bathroom.
What's the problem?
Just a thought --
You know we have to let Kirsty see this place, before we do anything to it. She'll love it.
How are you doing through there?
Just a moment. Put on some music will you babe?
Larry...
Not much fun, is it?
Drinking alone.
Well, isn't it?
No personal details?
I suppose not.
Why don't you take off your jacket? You're warm.
Why don't you do the same?
Well, if you change your mind. What's this friend's name?
I thought you were going to stay with us for awhile?
Big house.
I'll show you around when we've got this damn bed moved.
Are you O.K.?
What are you drinking, love?
I just wanted to be sure you were O.K.
...maybe we should never have come back.
I guess.
It's all right, sweetheart. Julia's told me everything; and it's all right...
I won't be able to stand.
Need any help?
Not that late.
Steve. Thank God you came.
These THINGS... they want to take me --
What's wrong?
'Bye.
Alison's.
Don't you want to hear what's next?
How can it be bullshit to state a preference?
Since you brought that bullshit tape in.
Yeah.
I'd think you were a cinematic idiot. And I'd feel sorry for you.
"-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yeah, yeah, I hear you --
The band that found me and asked me to join.
It was Jan, and it was a long time after--
Because it's in The Big Chill.
Liar.  We saw it in the Lawrence Kasdan double-bill with Body Heat.
Sonic Death Monkey.
Well what about the new Echo --
That is perverse.  Do not tell anyone you don't own fucking Blonde on Blonde.  What about Television?
No, not nothing.  What's wrong with the Righteous Brothers?
She shouldn't done it on "The Number Four With a Smile."
Who are you going to see?
Anna.
"Somebody's Gonna Die" by Blitz. "Bella Lugosi's Dead," Bauhaus. It's got that creepy Halloween feeling.
Where's Rob?
Right.  Why?
Oh.  Okay.
Right.  So.  You must have an enormous record collection.
Is there a difference?
Sure, but is that it for the list?
Yeah.
Who?  Oh.  My friend.  My friend is Laura.  A girl.  A friend who's a girl.
Okay. "Dance Music For Old People?"
Good.  Great.  Yeah... Wow.  Rob Gordon.  Seems like a 100 million years ago now.
Why did you break up with me for Marco?
What's this?
I've ah... got some other stuff to tell him anyway, so it's no problem. I'll just tell him about, you know, Laura, when I tell him the other stuff.
Let's not.
What needs sorting out?
You don't have to go this second. You can stay until whenever.
Shit!
How can you like Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye?  It's like saying you support the Israelis and the Palestinians.
What were the others?
Rob.  Don't be childish.
Look.  Maybe you'll grow up and we'll get it together, you and me.  Maybe I'll never see either of you again. I don't know.  All I know is that it's not a good time to be living here.
Well if you could tell me roughly it would help.
Of course it is.
The sleeping together is better but not the sex because you haven't done it was him yet.
I told you I slept with him.
Hello.
Are you still in love with me?
I'm sure.
I don't really want to talk about it, to be honest.
You know I didn't mind.  And it's not as if Ray's place is any better.
You know I'm a good person.
Guess who I just saw, right by my store?  Ian.  In Starbuck's.  Neat, huh?
Do you want me to be there?
Are you going to lie in that flower bed all night?
Sure, I understand.  Look, I don't want to take up any more of your time.  You get back, and I'll wait here for a bus.
No, no.  It's not... are you still on the pill?
Laura...
Was it like good sex or was it like bad sex?
Because I'm not allowed to.  I still do, after work.  So, what?  Should we just break up?  Is that what you're saying?  Because if you are, I'm going to run out of patience.
You haven't changed so much as a pair of socks in the years I've known you.  If we've grown apart, then I'm the one who's done the growing, and all I've done is change jobs.
Less neurotic.  Are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life?
Nothing.
Oh.  Well.  We don't really get along. Paul and I.
You did that deliberately.  You knew all along I'd like them.  It was a trick.
Yeah, and he said it's a good way to break out a record.  Especially for what he said, and I quote, "would be a highly anticipated event, locally." He helped me put out a press release.
What are you going to talk to me about?
Well forgive me if I don't think of you as the world's safest bet.
Rob here.
What's happenin'.
To think I sympathized with you for two seconds!  Poor Rob!  Laura left him out of nowhere for the schmuck upstairs.  You let me believe that!
You're kidding.  A crematorium? Jesus.
Enough, Liz.
So you live in Chicago now?
Hi, Marie.
It's a great song.
You share a place with T-Bone?
What do you mean, the Crumblers? You know the Crumblers?  Nobody's heard the Crumblers.  Except me.
The Conformist.
Tops off two whiskeys and starts into the other room where she sees Rob, standing and holding his jacket.
So you'll stay?
Would you like me to turn the lights out?  Or would you like them on?
So you say.  I'd like to hear her side of it.
Look.  Can I pay you properly?  You don't have to tell him what you got. Send him forty-five bucks and blow the rest.  Give it to charity.  Or something.
Look... I... I'm sorry.  I don't want to be any part of this.
Uh, yes I, like, do... It's simple. You make the tracks -- recording studio -- deliver them to the pressing plant where a master is cut, the master is then dubbed to submasters, which are the "mothers," as their called, for each press in the plant. You press the CD's or records, put in your cover art, and that's it.
Taupin, isn't that the guy Moran picked up the other night?
Well, the cream of society awaits.  If you're ever in the neighborhood...
Doesn't have a head, does he?
Poor little tyke didn't have a chance.  Hopelessly premature.  He died a few days after he was born.
This is against the rules.
Good reflexes.
Grave robbers?
Who?
Who is he?
He called you "MacLeod".
I'm a historian, Mr. Taupin. Only once in a lifetime do you stare history in the face.
You're wrong.
Our cars were seen together in Felton.  They're calling me an accessory to murder.
You make it all sound so simple.
There was a man once.  Just a simple woodcarver.  But he understood.  More than anyone he could see to the heart of it.  It never ends.  Today is the same as the first.  Tomorrow will be the same as today.  So much time.  And all of it wasted.  You love history?
William Taupin seems to have left his mark.
And you are William Taupin, aren't you?
I carried that rifle in World War I.  This book is a 16th Century policy report for the King of Austria.  The diploma is my con- ference of degree in Latin from Trinity College.  Class of 1672.  It goes on.
What is it like?  Being you?
But you're known so much. History I'll only read about.
What is it you want?
What's wrong?
Get out.
The emptyness.  The years and years of void.  Nothingness.  Bordered only by the quest for ultimate nothingness. Who would have guessed?
Life.  It is the gift and the under- standing of life.
Aren't you getting a little old for this?  You flunked out of law school.
But there's more.  Wednesday someone played javelin with the cemetary curator in Felton, Delaware.  Some locals spotted two cars with D.C. plates and surprise surprise, they turn out to be registered to our own Brenna Cartwright and the ever popular Richard Taupin.
Just for laughs we raided wonder boy's house.  There was a gallon of one of the corpse's blood in his carpet.  I think it was about then I withdrew his name for humanitarian of the year.
I liked the bit you did about Baltic chastity belts. Too bad no one else did.
Who is it?
Someone should check him out. Maybe a collection somewhere got knocked over.  He has one, he might have two.
Requiem acer'nam donaei-
Stop.
I did at that.
I was driven out.
In my travels I heard the story of the MacLeod boy struck down and brought from the hand of death by powers not of this Earth.
When I was a boy a cart driven by a drunken fool crushed me.  All thought I would die or be maimed for life.  But I healed quickly. And like you I paid the price for being different.
Do you ever feel a flow, as if some- thing were pushing against you?
Three days you've laid there. It's time you ate.
You are not dead, boy.  Accept it.
You must be.  You have responsibilities. You must learn the rules.  You can never attract attention to yourself, never show the side that will draw others to you.  You will always know when you are in the presence of another.  Beware. But more importantly Conor MacLeod, will be your battle against time.  In the coming years you will see kingdoms rise then rot like wheat.  People will become a transitory, pathetic lot.  The only constant you will know will be the others and the tradition their greed and quest represent.  But life without morality, without the ability to truly taste the sweetness of wine and love, is no life at all.  That is how the others exist.  Nothing more than walking corpses living only to slaughter each other in an insane quest to be the last.  Keep your soul sewed to the earth.  Do not become one of them.
Some think not.
There's rumor in the village. Some call it magic.
Please not be touching me, Conor.
Not so scared.
No doubt.
You're wrong.
Our common heritage.  I am your only real friend, you know.  The only one who truly understands you.  I look forward to the day we meet again.  And I kill you.
I doubt much can change that. The enemy has five brigades waiting for us.
Help?  I've seen others "help". Somehow a head always ended up on the counter.
Ah, Conor, how you look a man.
Are you sure?
Where!
He got him.  He always does.  Eventually.
How did you find me?
I'll never forget the look on that Papal commander's face when his "heretic stronghold" turned out to be a rock full of whores climbing all over Neuvich.
He found us even there.
Run!
You disappoint me.  I thought you'd finally gotten over that sort of thing.
I want you to come to me.
You're one of William's kids, huh?
Such a pretty day.  If I live to be 90 I'll never tire of mornings like this.  Mind you I'm 74 now.
Yes sir.  When you get older your priorities change.  It's the simple things that count.  Without them growing old can be a very lonely thing.
Ready? The Sheriff's just put two hundred more relatives on the payroll to protect the city against the Red Army -- which is leaving Moscow in a couple of minutes.  Up a dime.
Are you back?
Duffy! I'm sending Bensinger over to see you.  Mervyn, isn't it?
Let him have everything he wants.  Now hustle and write me a story from the point of view of the escaped man.  He hides, cowering... Afraid of every light, of every sound... hears footsteps... his heart going like that... And all the time they're closing in... Get the sense of an animal at bay!
I won't be more than ten minutes, I promise you.
Oh, it isn't like that.
You know, Hildy, he's not a bad fellow.
Say, what's happened to Burns? He looks sunk, doesn't he?
Well, at his age, twenty payment life, a little over a thousand dollars.
About twenty-five hundred dollars.
The five hundred? Sure.
But --
What's the matter?
Oh, I realized right away. He's really a very nice fellow, Hildy -- I found that out.
BRUCE!! How'd you get out?
I know I got you into this, Hildy, but it does seem to me that you can't care much for me if you're willing to let me stay locked up for two hours.
You're Bruce Baldwin?
This is a pleasure, Mr. Baldwin, and I'm sorry about the mistake.
You see, my wife -- I mean, your wife -- that is, I mean Hildy -- had led me to expect that she was marrying a much older man.
Attaboy!  Come on, Bruce.
Well, so you're getting married tomorrow, eh? How does it feel, Bruce?
I know I wasn't a good husband, Hildy, but you can always count on me.
Mighty nice little town, Albany. They've got the State Capitol there, you know.
Anything the matter?
Just what is the lowdown on Williams?
But couldn't you show the man wasn't responsible?
I feel I ought to take care of her.
Well, I'm independent, too.
Gee, you almost make me feel like a heel -- coming between you.
Well, Bruce, here you are -- certified and everything.
Don't thank me. I should thank you. So long.
And I'll take that certified check, too. I've decided I can handle things around here...
Ts! Ts! Ts!
Get out!
You're barking up the wrong tree, Hartman.
Call Duffy!
That's absurd on the face of it, Mr. Burns! He's talking like a child.
Save that for the Tribune.
You're repeating yourself! That's the speech you made the night you proposed.  "-- any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
Done what?
It would have worked if you'd been satisfied with just being editor and reporter. But no! You had to marry me and spoil everything.
Sweeney! You can't do that to me! Not today, of all days! Jumping Jehosophat! Oh, no, Sweeney... Well, I suppose so... All right. If you have to, you have to.  How do you like that? Everything happens to me -- with 365 days in the year -- this has to be the day.
There's nobody else on the paper who can write! This'll break me, unless --  Hildy!
If you won't do it for love, how about money? Forget the other offer and I'll raise you twenty-five bucks a week.
You can't sell me that, Walter.
Bermuda.
Well, he's waiting in the anteroom for me now.
Then what does he want with you?
And he takes his hat off when he's with a lady.
And when he walks with a lady, he waits for her!
I suppose I can't call this off without creating a scene -- but remember, it's your last fling.
Well, I'll tell you one thing, old man, she never looked at me the way she's looking at you.
You said it.
If he's nuts, why doesn't the State just put him away?
Why, Walter, you're getting poetic!
All right. The check will be certified. Want my fingerprints?
Where do you think you're going?
You've kicked over the whole City Hall like an apple-cart. You've got the Mayor and Hartman backed against a wall. You've put one administration out and another in. This isn't a newspaper story -- it's a career! And you stand there belly-aching about whether you catch an eight o'clock train or a nine o'clock train! Still a doll-faced mugg! That's all you are.
Attagirl! Why, they'll be naming streets after you -- Hildy Johnson Street! There'll be statues of you in the parks, Hildy. The radio'll be after you -- the movies!  By tomorrow morning I'll betcha there's a Hildy Johnson cigar! I can see the billboards now. Light up with Hildy Johnson!
Hildy!
Can I call the Mayor a bird of prey -- or is that libelous?
Bruce ought to be back by now. Walter, you're not trying anything again, are you?
Look at me, Hildy --
Butch! I'd put my arm in fire for you -- up to here!  Now, you can't double-cross me!... She does? All right -- put her on. I'll talk to her... Hello! Oh, hello, Madam... Now listen, you ten-cent glamour girl, you can't keep Butch away from his duty... What's that? You say that again and I'll come over there and knock your eye out! Hello?  I'll kill 'em! I'll kill both of 'em!  Duffy!  Mousing around with some big blonde Annie on my time! That's co-operation!  Duffy!!
Lafayette two-one-hundred.
Ring that number, will you?
Bruce is making the nine o'clock train. I told him you'd be on it -- unless you want to write this story yourself.
Suit yourself, kid. This isn't for me to decide. Of course, you could make a later train and still be in Albany tomorrow morning.
He's going to have you the rest of his life, Hildy. Can't you give me another hour?
Sure.
Hildy, if that's what you want, all right. We'll even go to -- how about Niagara Falls?
Well, if she looked like you -- Say! My brains and your looks -- that mightn't be such a bad combination.
Come on, Sheriff. We've got to get bail.
Anything you want, Boss.
Sure, boss.
And that means Earl Williams dies tomorrow morning and makes a sucker out of us!
He's on my phone. He just called me.
The newspapers! Sheriff, they're the scum of modern civilization.
Yes, shaking hands. I don't take a very good picture, though.
I see. You realize, however, that you committed a crime?
So -- now I say to you: 'Earl Williams, you are under arrest!' and you point your gun at me.
I call. What you got?
Kind of exclusive, ain't you? We got calls to make, you know.
She says she's gonna write fiction.
Boy, did you see her go?
Come on, you! Before we slap you down.
I'll call.
Goodbye, Yonson.
You ain't gettin' out o' here!
All right, then, I'll just run the story that Sheriff Hartman is afraid to let reporters interview his prisoner. Of course, with election coming, that might do you a lot of harm, but just as you say.
Where'd you get this?
A fine fair-weather friend you are!
Just one second --
Williams ain't a Red, and you know it!
I know it! But they've got nothing to do with this case! Do you realize there are two hundred thousand votes at stake and unless we hang Earl Williams we're going to lose 'em?
The Governor gave me his word of honor he wouldn't interfere. Two days ago!
Dementia praecox Oh-h-h!
No -- don't out me off.
Now take that guilty look off your face, Pete -- and stop trembling like a horse.
Walter, I can't tell you how badly I feel about this. There was no excuse for Hartwell to fly off the handle.
Fine, thanks, Sheriff.
And who accused him? Diamond Louis! One of the worst crooks in town! Why don't you arrest Louis instead of innocent people that he frames?
All right. You can't. But tomorrow the Post will run the story of that roulette game on 43rd Street that your brother-in-law runs. And we'll print that you get five hundred a month for forgetting about it!
I'm telling you. Can you imagine bumping into a load of cops?! They come rollin' out like oranges!
Nobody's going to rush me into anything!  You keep away from me!
There goes another scrub lady.
Well, anyhow, I won't be covering stuff like this any more.
Any news?
You fight it cut.
Come on with that money!
Here!
No -- and you don't know that your cheap boss has had Mr. Baldwin arrested again -- do you?
Any dope yet on how he got out?
Earl, you don't want to hurt your friends, do you?
Stop screaming, Mollie or we're sunk. I'm trying to think of something before those reporters get back.
What good'll it do?
They'll get him! They'll get him!
Hey --
Now, listen! You never arrived here with this -- reprieve. Get it?
But you could bring 'em in here! We'll pay all your expenses.
They wouldn't take it.
Well, well -- Miss Mollie Malloy.
Well -- Williams goes a little balmy and begins making speeches on a plan he's got to save the world. Only he makes his speeches, usually, on a very busy street and neglects to get a license for it. Well, the cops let him alone as much as they can because he's harmless and they're kinda sorry for him. But one day he decides to hold a meeting right in the middle of a Veteran's Parade and the cops chase him. He gets scared and goes into hiding.  Come in, Dave Schwartz.
Can I try?
Never let a rat creep up on you.
You're a dark horse, bowling googlies at your age. Toss me up another.
What are you doing here? This is our territory
I never was.
You want to join our gang?
You're the biggest fibber.
Crocodiles! Aah!
What is it?
...It was a toss-up. His company went to India, mine went to France. Flip of a coin.
Root it out Clive... the thought of it, before it takes hold.
Why not?
No Turks.
You mean they let you go through the officer training course and then said you were too old for a commission?
What are you going to be then?
I'm glad you didn't send them to your aunt.
I've found a bungalow to rent up the towpath, Clive. I never want to leave the river again. The children have had such a wonderful summer.
He always knows.
I won't have this vulgar talk in my house.
And where do you think you're going?
I don't believe this is happening to me.
It looks a bit fishy to me.
Now take deep breaths, and push.
...such nice boys with straw boaters and blazers. All the punts lit up with Chinese lanterns. Like fireflies. And the gramophone going on one of the boats. Always the Charleston, the Charleston, the Charleston. Oh, you girls.
What can you do with four daughters, I asked myself, A string quartet was all I could come up with. They hated me for making them learn.
It's so far way. I couldn't bear it.
I'm so glad you could come. Here we are, all together again.
I agree.
Come on, ma... this bitch's got it coming.
Drink up, it's party time.
Which way?
He left!
Um, yeah sure, I guess.
Thank you.
Hey, great they're back.
Do you believe this fucking girl?
Why? You gonna do something about it?
You all having a Halloween party tonight?
Keep the change and get yourself a new name.
What's this?
How long have you been running this place?
Fuck yeah, she is. I'd join a cult to get some of that... and the best part is she didn't try to kill the President or nothing, so that baggage ain't hanging around.
That reminds me of a film I saw once of a guy who got out of his car at Lion Country Safari to take a picture of a lion cub and got eaten by the lions.
Oh, don't worry she didn't get offended by what I said. You two got to lighten up... right, Bill?
Hey, I asked you if you wanted some chicken.
Almost there.
Shit, I'm all for being a sport, but this is ridiculous.
Should we stop?
Fine. I'll go straight.
I hope to Christ she doesn't expect us to wear these things.
Check this out.
How much is a person supposed to stand?
How's about you give me those same directions.
I... I got back a stack today. Some nice shots.  See, a good topless June Wilkinson... unfortunately she personalized it...  to Stucky, love June.
Worse than a fucking rabid baboon.
Goddamn.
No, he's just joking. We don't really have any plans other than spending the night at my Dad's house...  ...which is where we were headed when our car broke down.
Tiny ain't got no car, he ain't even got a bicycle.
You sure you don't need any help in there?
You'll have to forgive Tiny, he can't hear so much.
This isn't everything. Get ready for this... there's a Museum of Murder and Mayhem.
Aw, come on. It will be fun.
Fuck, it's freezing.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, so how does that fit with the story of four morons with a flat tire looking for a dead tree?
You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point?
Yeah, Jerry, she said some pretty fucked shit to us.
Someone is out there...  ...help, we're in here!
I swear I've aged five years since this trip started.
It will be nice to have a few days off to regenerate. This trip is fun, but it's starting to get brutal.
Geez, he never gets tired does he.
Stick her in the front, if you want to pick her up so bad. She's soaked.
I think I'm going fucking crazy.
She said we look like pussy lickers or some shit like that.
How long has it been?
I don't hear anything.
Jesus Christ.
Holy Jesus, somebody had themselves a field day beating the shit outta this thing.
God damn.
Well Christ boy, don't stand there like a prize dog dick with his butthole caught up a tree.
Hey, maybe the guy with the tow truck could drive us to a phone.
Oh, I get it... I guess you think you're too good for the simple pleasures of Halloween.
I suggest you kids leave now.
Behold... The Fish-Boy!
Questions? Well, heck, I'll tell you anything you want to know.
Please, just a minute.
That's true, Otis... not that we're having a bad time, but...
Hey.
Local girl, Karen Murphy, been missing for a couple months, figured for a runaway.
Turn up this road.
Yeah, I hear it... where's it coming from?
Jesus Christ.
What about the body you found?
Well, let's go see if the nut that runs this place can help us.
You know, his senses start tingling... when he was approaching danger and shit.
Sounds like a bad idea to me, probally just get in the way.
Don't worry, we'll find her.
I'm gonna see if anybody's home. You and Mr. Willis take a look around the grounds for any sign of anything.
Wydell.
Over.
Harold! Tell the boy again.
And?
Well, don't jump down my throat. I'm just trying to help.
Let's go eat, I'm starved.
Only three shocks. A chimp takes fifteen. This is going to be tres simple, no, Gabrielle?
Puff it is then. Puff Bronfman. Is that okay?
Well, I don't know. I'm actually on my way to...
I was in my p.j.'s when I remembered I left some papers I need to go over.  See? I rushed right out of the house. I must look a mess. I'm so embarrassed.
Coincidence, yes?  And how is our son?
I should turn them off.  Maybe I sing him a lullaby my mama sang to me when I was a little girl.
Fine.
My little French.
Gabby, you know I'm trying to sort things out.
Well, I think...
No.
Very well.
We're going back to nature, you and I. I'm going to retrain you. I'm going to make you free again if I have to kill you doing it.
He's dead.
Oh yes, honey. Getting to be smooth smooth smooth all over. Smooth as a baby's butt.
Cause there's this guy. My brother knows him. Might be right up your alley.
My brother is discreet.
So?
No. I married a midget.
Go the fuck away, Rosie.
I don't know, honey. I don't know. Maybe he just didn't want to get involved.
And I'm going to miss the lifestyle having you as a client has afforded me.
I like you so much, with or without hair.  But don't spread that around. Bad for business.
Slugdom. Sluggishness. Whatever you'd call it. I'm not there yet. I still have many human characteristics.
Yes. I suppose not. But still. One would like to move along. To move beyond.
It looks wonderful.
I'm sorry?
No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward in certain areas.
It's just that I have some peculiarities, and...
I think I'll get Johannsen in chemistry on that.  Oh! Did you bring the first aid kit?
Flares?
Actually, I just had an amusing thought.
What are you doing in there?
I'm the same person I was before you knew, damn it! Oh God!
Was that okay? I mean, was I able to... satisfy you?
It would just be helpful to know.
Because, you know, you seem so distant. And you work late every night. And we hardly ever have sex, and when we do, it's... I don't know. It feels different.
Do you like my new look?
Oh!  I didn't see you there, sneaky boy!  You're like a boy sneaking in...
Oh, baby. I'm sorry. Can't you hire somebody else?
Yes! And I want to help. You won't have to pay me, and I was thinking of giving up that crazy nature writing anyway.
Puff, I'm proud of you! You did remarkably well under difficult circumstances.
You were gone a long time.
That's funny because, you know, I just went and picked him up at some flophouse on the lower eastside. He called here when he ran out of his "mad" money after spending an entire evening drinking, watching strippers, and fucking a whore!  Oh, and what did you do tonight, honey?
This is great, Puff. You're doing fine.
I bow to your expertise in these matters.
Free to come and go as you please. There's some "mad money" in the night table drawer.
Interesting.
It's a pleasure to meet you, mother. But I'm an ape like dad was...  And I have to go back into the woods now... forever.
Yes.
Boys just passing through?
You, uh, you ever been to Louisville during Derby week, Miss, ah, Packard?
Yeah, I think we do. We could try to cut each other up. But that would be bad for everybody. Bad for me, bad for you. And worst of all, be bad for Eddie.
To win.
You bastard.
Could be.
Oh, we'll start small... a hundred dollars a game.
Hey, mister.
Stay with this kid. He's a loser.
Make it twenty.
Poker's not your game.
I don't think there's a pool player alive shoots better pool than I saw you shoot the other night at Ames. You got talent.
You bet he knows how.  You think that's a talent too, huh? Knowin' how to drink whisky? You think Minnesota Fats was born knowin' how to drink?
That's your problem.
First time in ten years I ever saw Minnesota Fats hooked, really hooked. But you let him off.
Get the three thousand. Play Minnesota Fats again.
Ten reasons. Maybe fifteen. And also there's something in it for me.
For me.
What happened to you anyway?
He's a gentleman. Gentleman gambler. He gets his kicks playing with hustlers. He's got an old Southern mansion with a pool table in the basement, drinks eight-year-old bourbon, smokes cork-tipped cigarettes.
What's the matter? What happened?
Well, we won't.
When do I raise the bet?
Bert, if that's his best game, I can beat him.
I'll beat him the next game.
They're fine.
So you figure you're still my manager, huh?
We really stuck the knife in her, didn't we, Bert?
Maybe. You want to play?
Who's he?
You name it, we shoot it.
It's gonna cost ya money. It always does.
You ought to take up crap shooting. Talk about luck!
Whaddya mean?
It's quiet.
Ten grand. I'm gonna win ten grand in one night.  ...Well, who's gonna beat me? C'mon, Charlie, who's gonna beat me?
Quit. He's too good.
Hey, how much are we ahead?
Preacher, go on down and get me some breakfast, will ya? Egg sandwich and a cup of coffee. You want something, Charlie?
No, it isn't, Charlie.
Hello, Charlie...  C'mon in...  That's my girl.
Oh, I don't want to be no bother to nobody.
How do you want me to play it? I'm broke.
I want you to come back on the road with me.
This boy's crazy. They wiped the floor with him. They beat his brains out and he wants to go back.  What for? To take another beating?
With what?
Oh yeah? Where?
HOW MUCH?!
C'mon, c'mon, just give me the money.
You still don't see it, do you, Charlie? You are nothing but a small- time Charlie. You'd love to keep me hustling for you, huh? Wouldn't ya? I mean, a couple more years with me, scuffling around them little towns and those back alleys. You might make yourself enough to get a little poolroom back in Oakland. Six tables and a handbook on the side. Is that when you say goodbye to me, Charlie?
When?
That's right. When?
Beautiful shot, Felson. Beautiful. You've played billiards before, Mr. Felson. Ah, you gentlemen sure you don't care for a drink?
Charles, will you call a cab for these gentlemen, please.  I'd show you to the door, but I...
How much you playin' for?
You sure you don't want to quit, friend?
You better not miss, friend.
Long wait for a bus?
Just a cup of black coffee, please...  Hey, ma'am! Wait a minute!  Would you, uh, like another cup?
Yours.
That wouldn't give us much time, would it?
Have a nice trip.
Oh, you need a shave. You mustn't go looking like that. There's a razor and shaving cream in the bathroom. Compliments of the house.
How did you know my name was Sarah?
Well, I believe you when you say you go to school.
What, are you kidding? See that book?  I've been trying to get through that book ever since I first got here. I haven't finished the first chapter.  Did you read all them books?
Oh, stop talking about yourself like you're a lush or something. I don't like it.  Maybe you ought to go to a clinic, get some treatments.
No, why should I? It's yours.
Do you want me to go?
Who is it?
What happened?
I don't know. I'm not sure. He said there are people who want to lose, who are always looking for an excuse to lose.
Well, what else does?
Yeah.  Yeah. It bothers me a lot.  'Cause, you see, twice, Sarah -- once at Ames with Minnesota Fats and then again at Arthur's...  ...in that cheap, crummy poolroom... Now, why'd I do it, Sarah? Why'd I do it? I coulda beat that guy, I coulda beat him cold. He never woulda known. But I just had to show 'em, I just had to show those creeps and those punks what the game is like when it's great, when it's really great. You know, like anything can be great -- anything can be great... I don't care, bricklaying can be great. If a guy knows. If he knows what he's doing and why, and if he can make it come off. I mean, when I'm goin' -- when I'm really goin' -- I feel like...  ...like a jockey must feel. He's sittin' on his horse, he's got all that speed and that power underneath him, he's comin' into the stretch, the pressure's on him -- and he knows -- just feels -- when to let it go, and how much. 'Cause he's got everything workin' for him -- timing, touch. It's a great feeling, boy, it's a real great feeling when you're right, and you know you're right. It's like all of a sudden I got oil in my arm. Pool cue's part of me. You know, it's a -- pool cue's got nerves in it. It's a piece of wood -- it's got nerves in it. You feel the roll of those balls. You don't have to look. You just know. Ya make shots that nobody's ever made before. And you play that game the way nobody's ever played it before.
You need the words?
Sherry.  Very old, very dry.
What is it, Eddie?
For how long?
I got no idea of love. And neither have you. I mean, neither one of us would know what it was if we saw it coming down the street.
Well, that old lovin' horse paid twenty-two forty.  Let's see... two hundred I won from the jockey last night. And today at the track... I got five hundred and forty bucks.  Here, you hold it.
Would you go on back to the hotel? Take a cab, go on back to the hotel.
California? Is your name Felson? Eddie Felson?
I hear you've been looking for me.
That's what the game's all about.
Very good shot.
Preach! Go down and get me some White Tavern whisky, a glass, and some ice.
Fats, I got about two hundred dollars here.
I quit, Eddie. I can't beat you. Willie, give him the stakes.  You got yourself a pool player.
It is not arguing to speak the truth.
What do you want?
Good evening.  Did you have a pleasant day today?
That sounds charming.  What are you planning to do tomorrow?
You built things.
Bathroom?
I know, son.  But you'll like it where we're going.  I'm getting a good job.  It's a pretty part of the country.
Wow.  Look at the mountains.
Wow.  There's the town.  And there's the air base.  This is a great hill.
... and Rigel.
Well, son?  Should we call it a night?  I for one have had a long day.
Jim -- what's wrong?!
Are you sure you saw that?  In the rain -- it may have <u>looked</u> like it changed shape --
It was so real, Dad.
Is that all he said?
Yes, I do, Mr. Gardner.
But you saw -- the men go under the sand ...
George, where have you been?
Your father asked you a question.
I wish I could do more but we're moving out.
This could be our last night on Earth. I don't want to die a virgin.
This is not the time or the place to have this same old discussion.
In case you haven't noticed, we're in a little bit of a crisis here.
I can't leave. We have to tell this to the President.
Are you all right?
David thought I was having an affair, which I wasn't.
Okay, why did I just send my family to Atlanta?
David, I've been meaning to talk with you. It's nice you've been spending so much time with me, but...
You still got the Olds?
Perfect, she's using it.
You punched the President in the face?
Must be thousands of them. What are they doing?
We're loose!
Is my wife in the air?
How're we doing?
Pilots, sir. We don't have enough people to get them in the air.
Get on the horn with Atlantic Command. Let's upgrade the situation to DEFCON 3.
That's impossible...
You were the head of the National Intelligence Agency! You knew all about this. When were you planning on informing the rest of us!?
A meteor?
Really? Ballet?
Dylan, come here. I want you to meet the First Lady.
It's the wrong field, you idiot! Lucas' farm is on the other side of town.
I'm not leaving.
Call them back.
What can you tell us about the enemy we're facing?
My reputation precedes me.
May we go home now, please?
Your treat.
Dad?
That doesn't look much like a library.
Schneider?
This is a castle. And we have many tapestries. But if you're a Scottish lord, then I am Mickey Mouse.
"Where the cup that holds the blood of Jesus Christ resides forever."
An old man's dream.
Let me tell you another "bedtime story," Doctor Jones. After the Grail was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea, it disappeared and was lost for a thousand years before it was found again by three Knights of the First Crusade. Three brothers, to be exact.
I'm through!
Except he's lost, and I'm not.
Wouldn't it be wonderful if he were here now to see this?
My room!
At least I let you tag along.
This one. I think he's in here.
I never expected to see you again.
No, Dad. You listen to me --
Oh, it breaks the heart.
Rats?
You didn't, did you?  You didn't bring it, did you?
She ransacked her own room and I fell for it. How did you know she was a Nazi?
What am I looking for?
Feels like a cigarette lighter.
Dad!
This is intolerable!
Come on, Dad. Come on!
You're going the wrong Way! We have to get to Berlin!
Well, he who finds the Grail must face the final challenge.
Three devices of such lethal cunning.
I wrote them down in my Diary so that I wouldn't have to remember.
Yes! The only thing that matters is the Grail.
Do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink? I had a milk shake.
A regret. It was just the two of us, Dad. It was a lonely way to grow up. For you, too. If you had been an ordinary, average father like the other guys' dads, you'd have understood that.
Well... I can't think of anything.
What do you think you're doing?! Get down!
Now, who are all these people?
Dad?
Dad?!
Uh-huh.
Get that camel out of the way!
I don't need camels.
Why are you trying to kill us?
My father was looking for the Holy Grail. Did you kill him too?
This is your last chance.
And why were you trying to kill me?
Who?
Hard to believe, isn't it...?
He's not exactly what we call "a spring chicken".
I would say you look rather lost.  But then I cannot imagine where in the world the three of you would look at home...
I was dubious myself at first. Then something connected -- the village's rock and the old legend of the Sankara Stones...
Mola Ram is telling the faithful of out victory. He says the British have left the palace, which proves Kali Ma's new power.
Now what about the antidote, Lao.
You got the tickets, Short Round?
Indy, look!
Get to sleep Indy -- I stay up and keep eye on things...
The village knew their rock was magic -- but they didn't know it was one of the lost Sankara Stones...
They dig for the gems to support our cause. They also search for the last two stones. Soon we will have all five Sankara Stones and the Thuggees will be all powerful!
Give me the stones!
No, the stones are mine!
It is Pankot Palace that kills my village.
Was the stone very smooth?  It was probably brought here from a sacred river.
You don't look very good.
I'm freezing. What do you mean, tag along? From the minute you walked into that nightclub, you haven't been able to keep your eyes off me.
And then they took their children.
What'd he say now?
Indy! Help me!
Okay, I want you to lift your hand -- and pet the snake.
What's happening?
What about the future?
You're dying to come into my room, aren't you?
We'll see who gives in first -- I'll leave my door open.
Oh no -- oh no!!
There's bugs! Bugs all over! Help! Help me!
A fulcrum release lever!
What're we going to do?!
Arrrgh!
Al.
Go home. Good idea. Get some rest.
Somebody's been here.
Kind of an oversight, wouldn't you say.
I told you, my name is Al.
You've heard of the PEM114...
What for?
Don't do it.  Don't aim at the head.
Why he's argumentative?
You weren't listening!
What'd he look like?
I wouldn't say that.
Get your breathing down. You sound like a cement mixer.
I want out.
Calm Down! Act rational.
Yeah...Who is?
Which way do I go?
You need ID in there?
I don't wanna be you. I wanna go home.
It's illegal.
Now what?
This must be business, there's nothing else here.
You stumbled around. Remember, you've got my ID, you've got to be me, not some stumblebum.
But what's it look like?
You really like that shirt?
You're not just after this girl, are you?
I feel like an idiot.
Just don't show fear.
He recognises you, throw him off.
Joe, be careful!
They're all in it.
Voice stress analyzer.
I'll be right here. I'll keep it in mind. I'll get a lot more from her without you butting in.
You shut down your sensors.
What Happened?
And on my time.
Bingo.
Better. I found Ryuji.
Osaka.
Don't you think I stand out like this.
On what?
Sapporo..
...drink it.
What next!
What are you doing?
You sure this will work?
Dieter!
There's a lot you don't know.
This may hurt.
Do something.
Dieter asked where I was. He expected me here. Maybe someone was assigned to bring me here.
Not really. Truth is...I was ..jealous. Of you.
You're a lucky man.
She's so lovely. It's all my fault...I was wrong.
Don't worry, I owe you a lot. I'm not gonna let us rot here. I'm gonna find us a way out.
You just got a Mickey.
Not that truth!
Doesn't matter.
I'm against it.
I didn't do anything.
I knew you were trouble.
You've cut your hair?
We'll have to let them go.
Must be delayed effects of the drug... I'll get him out of here.
That crazy guy?
It is to me too.
And...you know Jan Gruner?
When you do...
Sergeant Finnegan. Name's right there on the card. Are you sure you're alright?
Home. Your home. The address on your form.
Don't you want to get out?
You'll feel better
Why would we want to hurt you?
Was quite excited, when he came in...
The fresh tuna?..
Yes...What is it?
You mean from it.
...and sort of...disinterest.
Can I help?
Who else is interested in me?
Your friends, did they ask about me?
You work for Ryuji?
Did he put you up to it? Did he ask you to sleep with me?
He didn't.
Then why are you smiling like that?
And you?
What happened?
Are you alright?
I'm sorry I got you into this.
Just like that?
What is it?
What could you find in this place?
You can't take that.
What'd he say, how's he know about Al?
Look, nobody knows we did it.
Yeah? What for?
Hey, baby. What's wrong?
Mom.
Just ran into two of your "geologists." Geologists whose hands aren't all chewed up...?
Three hours.
When's your deadline?
It's a smear campaign, Charlie.
And it's bullshit. And if I'm right, are you going to put the Journal's reputation behind a story that's going to blow up in your face?
Can I go to dance tomorrow? I'm better...
So, what are you going to do?
You're taking "no" for an answer?
What the hell are you doing?
Did you handle the round, Mr. Wigand?
Oh, Bill... Main Justice is investigating a major New York bank. Laundering narco dollars out of their Mexico City branch. You want it for the Evening News?
I'm gonna do a follow-up.
If this holds up, and it very well may not, Mike... but, if it did. And we aired this segment? And CBS was sued by Brown & Williamson? I think we could be at grave risk.
Come again?
Hey, Lowell.
How prominent? What kind of placement?
Hello?
...taping?  What are you taping?
My name's Lowell Bergman... I'm --
No classes this morning?
Will independent sources corroborate that?
Let me see this... No, 'cause I gotta know where you're going at all times.
Two p.m. Great. Bye-bye.
What's wrong?
Jeffrey Wigand...
"I'm Lowell Bergman, I'm from '60 Minutes.'" You know, you take the "60 Minutes" out of that sentence, nobody returns your phone call. Maybe Wigand's right. Maybe I'm hooked. What am I hooked on? The rush? "60 Minutes"? What the hell for? Infotainment. It's so fucking useless, all of it.
Yes, I'm right here. Could you call me back on a hard line?
Area code 212-555-0199.
...come in earlier on Mike's Marine barracks line when he's talking to Sheikh Mussawi...
Well, it isn't "cigarettes are bad for you"...
So, is everything okay?
Thank you for saying that...
It went great in Mississippi, Mike.
I've been banished. In lieu of being fired.
I don't know. How does that get Wigand on the air?
I disappeared on you?
I see a rhetorical question on the horizon.
Oh, how fortunate I am to have Lowell Bergman's moral tutelage to point me down the shining path. To show me the way.
Mike... in my...
Coffee?
How have you liked your stay?
Perhaps you prove journalism objectivity and I see the questions first. Then I decide if I grant the interview.
How do you like your coffee? Black?
...protect your sources...! You screwed me! You sold me out!
What do...
Seven dwarfs?
I've always thought of myself... as a man of science. That's what's wrong with it.
What did you get us?
Is that why you became a journalist? Then you get to ask all the questions?
My father was a mechanical engineer... most ingenious man I ever knew.
I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I? I could be anything. Right? Anything worth putting on between commercials...
Yes.
Excuse me. Yeah...
Jeff, call the FBI right away...
Liane, this is a preliminary...  You didn't tell her we were taping? What did she think she was coming to New York for?
"Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly, at least within..."
Some public relations guy got a hold of a tape of an interview... where you're saying you were on the American Judo Team in the Olympics...?
That's the whole point, Jeffrey. That's the whole point. Anyone's. Everyone's. They are gonna look under every rock, dig up every flaw, every mistake you've ever made. They are going to distort and exaggerate everything you've ever done, man. Don't you understand?
I've got to teach class. I've got to go. I've got to teach class.
Did he hear you?
What about now?
Just give me an example...
I don't want to be paranoid... I mean, maybe it's a game. Some kind of mind game.
What are you talking about?
I heard you. But I got to arrange a legal defense first. I got to get you to testify in court, get it on public record.
Object!
My co-counsel, Ron Motley, and I have filed a lawsuit against the tobacco industry on behalf of the State of Mississippi to get the state reimbursed Medicaid costs for treating people with smoking-related illness.  If you'd be interested in talking to us, we'd certainly like to talk to you...
Jail?
And, he gets out there and he has five strokes on us. He has more concentration than anybody I've ever met. It's spooky how he can concentrate.
You threatening my family, now, too?
Yes. Your husband did show remarkable foresight in taking those pictures. And, yes, absent a swimming pool, the presence of the pool man would appear to be suspicious. But Bonnie, who is the real victim here? Let me suggest the following. Your husband, who on a prior occasion slapped you -- beat you --
Please -- was at the time brandishing your firearm, trying in his rage to shoot an acquaintance -- friend of long standing --
Miles, how nice of you to see us -- may I introduce Howard D. Doyle of Doyle Oil.
Sixteen years? Howard Jr. is fourteen and Mandy must be what -- twelve?
They say the Massey pre-nup has never been penetrated.
Course I can't do much "wriggling" if you tie me up like that again. Massey -- this is one bad bad little girl.
-- understand what you're asking for here. The Massey pre-nup provides that in the event of a dissolution of the marriage for any reason, both parties shall leave it with whatever they brought in, and earned during. No one can profit from the marriage. The pre-nup protects the wealthier party.
I am here representing Mr. Dumbarton, on a... matter of some delicacy.
Well, actually, all whores worship the dollar, if you want to get technical.
He's the wrong man.
My God.
That was Marvin Untermeyer.
She's rich. We're still married. We have no pre-nup.
So who'd you hire?
Maybe she wanted a free trip to LA. Maybe they offered her money. Massey is very seductive. Who knows.
You said 'yes' didn't you?
-- Ruth Rabinow, this is Rex Rexroth. And you must be Mrs. Rexroth.
These are yours.
I assume this is on Rex?
Not really. You're not my client. Freedom of association. Big issue with the First Amendment fans. Want to go to Hawaii for the weekend?
Yes. I loved my husband, Rex.
Oh, for the love of...
Yes. He's a diamond in the rough. And I have a feeling that someday soon you'll be taking that diamond and leaving the rough.
Well, when this goes south -- promise you'll have dinner with me?
It has bones. Be sure to swallow one.
Marylin? When did I say...?
Okay. Should I stop at Starbucks and pick up a blended for --
She never particularly cared for me.
No. She loved me. She would never not love her son. She just didn't... I wasn't her "type." She said I was a very, colicky baby. You know? Difficult. Not a good sleeper? Didn't eat well? We got off to a bad start, and she never seemed to recoup --
And here I thought my mother was...
We are, Miles. You know I'm right. There's something "off" about you and me Miles. And maybe it isn't because of these women -- maybe they were just extremely insightful and recognized our "deficiencies" very early on. Maybe...
But?
Here's my card. Spend as much as you want. We get mileage.
Good.  Are those foods?
Exactly. And then -- maybe -- not right away -- There's a room right off the bedroom -- It would be perfect for a nursery.  It's a walk in humidor right now -- but if I took out the refrigeration unit --
I have a surprise for you.
Miles. I have a very good relationship with all the salesmen. I can return everything.
I don't believe you have "things."
I'm reporting you to the IRS.
Wait! He works for YOU?
You were going to have this thug...?
Pre-Castro.
I was devastated. Of course.
Do you think he set me up? Do you think that was his intention?
Please. I'm not seeing anyone until this is over. One husband at a time.
I don't know what his game is. He dismissed every one of Ruth's proposals. And Sarah, we weren't unreasonable.
I don't know. Ruth kept her cool, but I could tell she was surprised.
That stinks. They left you with absolutely nothing. It makes you wonder about the entire legal system. Like Rodney King.
Is this Ming?
I can't do this anymore. Let's get some lunch.
But you're going through with it?
-- is not a challenge. I need something I can sink my teeth into, professionally speaking.
Mr. Massey --
What?!
My client has ruled that out.
Did Marylin end up with money?
Don't threaten me, Miles. I did nothing illegal.
Ah.
Gotcha. No need to get anatomically correct with me, Rex.
And she has...?
Sometimes I have serious doubts about you.
I tried to reach Ruth, but we couldn't get her.
Did you know Mrs. Rexroth was married?
Thorstenson Gieselensen. He just separated from his third. He's in fish. He is fish.
We can't do the impossible, Mr. Andrews.
How is she?
Mr. Warne?
What's the matter? Isn't it cheap enough? A trip like that would cost you a thousand dollars!
What ten thousand?
Who said anything about a reward!
Listen, did anybody ever make a sucker out of you? This is a matter of principle. Something you probably wouldn't understand.  When somebody takes me for a buggy ride I don't like the idea of having to pay for the privilege.
You can't tempt me.  Do you hear? I won't eat!
What do you expect to accomplish by all this? I'm already married!
You only met him once .
A time will come when you'll thank me for this.
I knocked several times.
You've been acting so strangely since you returned. I'mI'm worried. I haven't bothered to ask you any questionsI  Isn't all this what you wanted?  You haven't changed your mind about King, have you?
I haven't seen you cry since you were a baby. This must be serious.  Where'd you meet him?
Fine man to fall in love with.
I'd like to have a talk with him.
Yes, I guess I have.  I don't want to hurt anybody any more. I want to get away from all this front page publicity. It suddenly strikes me as being cheap and loathsome. I can't walk out on King now. It'll make us all look so ridiculous.  Besides, what difference does it make?  I'll never see Peter again.
Oh, nono.
Why, no . . . Don't be silly.
Are you going to see him?
Been sending her meals in regularly?
Why didn't you jam it down her throat?
Why; naturally, I
You talk as if
What would you like to have me do?
What happened?
Yessir.  There's a report here from every State along the East coast. Want to hear them?
Don't want to talk todon't want to talk to anybody. Don't want to see anybody.
We ain't ate nothin' since yestidday.
Okay! Okay! Keep your shirt on, young feller.
The papers! The papers! Whadda you mean throwin' 'em out!
That's a long story, my friend. You see, I don't like sitting on newspapers. I did once and all the headlines came off on my white pants.
Oh, yeah?
That storm sure made a mess outa these roads.
Oh, my heavens! It's gone!
No, I've got that, all right. But my money. All I have here is four dollars. I've got to get to New York with it.
See here, can you understand English! I don't want it reported!  Please stay out of my affairs!  I want to be left alone.  A CLOSE-UP of PETER shows him glaring after her.
Oh, thank you.  We're in Jacksonville, aren't we?
That was foolish of me. Why didn't you shove me away?
Oh, you did? What am I expected to doleap for joy?
That, I suppose, makes everythinguhquite all right.
Very outspoken, too. Said I looked funny. Wasn't that cute?
Why, Peter! Don't you want to hear about our lovely friends?
Thanks. Nurses, governesses, chaperones, even body-guards. Oh, it's been a lot of fun.
It has its moments. It got to be a sort of game to try to outwit father's detectives. II did it once; actually went shopping without a body-guard. It was swell. I felt absolutely immoral. But it didn't last long. They caught up with me in a department store. I was so mad I ran out the back way and jumped into the first car I saw. Guess who was in it?
KingKing Westley was in it.
Um-hm. We rode around all afternoon. Father was frantic. By 6 o'clock he was having all the rivers dragged.
Aw, now, don't you start telling me I shouldn't dunk.
Thanks, professor.
Yeah. I got a letter from Aunt Betty. She says if we don't stop over at Wilkes-Barre she'll never forgive us.
We could start a two-person stock company. If things get toughwe can play some small town auditoriums. We'll call this one "The Great Deception."[8]
I better go over and see her.
Poor old Shapeley. You shouldn't have frightened him like that.
Must be some strange power Westley has over you women.  How do you expect to get there?
Aren't you afraid of me?
Nothing.  Nothing you'd give two cents for.
Carrots.
But the thumb always works. Different ways to do it, though. Depends on how you feel. For instance, number one is a short, jerky movement  That shows independence. You don't care if they stop or not. 'Cause you got some money in your pocket, see?
What're you going to do?
Oh, you've been hurt! There's a cut on
You don't have to eat the carrots.  Just passed a pond with some ducks in it.
Any luck?
I'll bet you're in an awful hurry to get back to New York, aren't you?
Maybe I could jump out of the window.  Do you think they'd see me?
No harm in your coming to see us.
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
What's the matter?  Where's your husband, young lady
Yesif he is your husband.
Why, you can't put me out in the middle of the
Can I use your telephone? I want to talk to New York.
But I don't go in for that kinda stuffmuch. I like to pick my fillies. Take you, for instance. You're my type. No kiddin' sister. I could go for you in a big way. "Fun-on-the-side Shapeley" they call me, and the accent is on the fun, believe you me.
Oh, by the waywhat's your name?
Heyyou not up yet? Come oncome on!
The old man's screwy!
Mr. Gordon
Free verse, huh?  What the dickens was free about it? It cost this paper a gob of dough. Well, I'm here to tell you, it's not gonna cost us any more.
Okay, Joe. Listenyou know I've always liked you. Anytime I could do you a great turnanytime I ran into a story that looked goodI always came running to you, didn't I? Well, I got one now. Those wires I sent you were on the level. It's the biggest scoop of the year. I'm giving it to you, Joe.
Who's the guy she's gonna marry?
You!
Now I know you're drunk.  I'm going home. Don't annoy me any more.
I met her on a bus coming from Miami. Been with her every minute.  I'm in love with her, Joe.
Listen, manI'll tell you what I'll do. When I come back in the morning, I'll buy it back from you and give you ten dollars profit? What do you say?
Funny couple, ain't they?
What do you reckon that's for?
A trumpet?
Send it collect.
There you gotrustin' people again. How many times did I tell you
Not a minute!
Huh?
Oh, thanks, thanks, Mister. I always knew you guys were kind-hearted.
If this is Oswald, it must be our third Oswald.
William Walter, the night clerk on duty here in the FBI office, gave me a copy of this.  It went all over the country.  Nothing was done, and the motorcade went ahead on schedule - and this wasn't even mentioned in the Warren Report!  Read it, Al.
Why you keep dancing on my head for, my man?  We been thicker'n molasses pie since law school.
When did you first do business with this Bertrand?
And Oswald?
You found out about Dave Ferrie going to Texas today and you went through all my files to see what was going on.  You're a goddamn spy.
I always lock my files.  And you were the only one here today...  What do you mean, you son of a bitch?
Bill.
It's you I want to talk to, Bill.
Who do you think fed him that information?  Garrison's going down. We're talking your career here, Bill, your life.  You're a young guy... we know you're working that Castro thing.
It's addressed to no one and no signature.  "To leave this life is, for me, a sweet prospect.  I find nothing in it that is desirable and on the other hand, everything that is loathsome."
You know you keep saying that.
Clay Bertrand?  Sure I know him.  He comes around the Quarter.
Did he pay you for this?
Lord, wake me, please.  I must be dreaming.
Well, it's a terrific yard, Chief, but the man's an obvious alcoholic with a reputation lower than crocodile piss.
He'll never sign a statement, boss, let alone get on a witness stand.
I still have to question what the legal basis is that supports this, boss.  Susie's stuff is colorful, but...
Shaw's our toehold, Bill.  I don't know exactly what he is, where he fits, and I don't care.  I do know he's lying through his teeth and I'm not gonna let go of him!
...and have you ever met David Ferrie?
...did you ever use the alias Clay Bertrand?
Yeah, you got it.  Since you're the only straight shooter in that fuckin' office, I'd like an answer from you. Did you plant it?
You think your investigation's been all that secret?  You know, when you talk to people, they talk to other people.
You still questioning any Cubans?
The Fontainbleau?  20 minutes?
What about the mob, Dave?  How do they figure in this?
In the morning we went goose hunting. Then headed home, but I dropped the boys off to see some relatives and I stayed in Hammond.
Oh yes, well, come to think of it, they're right.  We got to where the geese were and there were thousands of them.  But you couldn't approach them.  They were a wise bunch of birds.
Yes, now I remember, Mr. Garrison. I'm sorry, I got confused.  We got out there near the geese and it was only then we realized we'd forgotten our shotguns.  Stupid, right?  So of course we didn't get any geese.
Why?  What's wrong?
Shit!  Forgot to glue this fuckin' rug today.  You know, at one time I even had a full head of hair like everyone else.  And then I lost that. That fuckin' Clay Shaw.  I hate the bastard.  All I got left is in his rotten, bloody hands.  He tipped the newspapers - I know it.  That's how the Agency works.  They use people, chew them up, spit 'em out.  Now it's my turn.
They'll get to you, too - they'll destroy you... They're untouchable, man...  I'm so fucking exhausted I can't see straight.
As a pathologist it was your obligation to explore all possible causes of death, was it not?
Your Honor, I would ask you to direct the witness to answer my question. Why did Colonel Finck not dissect the track of the bullet wound in the neck?
I'm going to have to ask the jury to leave the courtroom.
That's our case!
Dad, look what I drew.
Daddy!  Where have you been?
He asked me why I thought I was in danger and I said:
Four to six.
Don't get sidetracked!  How does he get back to the States?  That's the point.  Does he have any problems?
Aren't you being a little hard?
I'm sorry.
Who?
Mr. Shaw, can you identify this man?
May I go?  Regardless of what you may think of me, Mr. Garrison, I am a patriot first and foremost.
Jim, dinner's just about ready... I've got a surprise for you... tried something new... Jim?  Jim, dinner.
Jim, come on, honey, get down on your hands and knees and hunt for Jasper's Easter egg.
My sympathies.
We waited for you... hours, Jim. You could have telephoned, for God's sake.  It's Easter!  You promised, Jim.
I think you care more about John Kennedy than your family!  All day long the kids are asking, "Where's Daddy?"  What am I supposed to tell your kids, Jim!
Honey, come on.  The government wants you to be scared.  They want everybody to be scared to speak out.  They count on it.  But there's nothing to be scared of.
Of course, I've changed!  My eyes have opened, and once they're open, believe me, what used to look normal seems insane!  And now King.  Don't you think this has something to do with that?  Can't you see?
Post Office.
Can we find her?
Goddamn Sam!
You know who the mayor was?
Hell, you're the District Attorney. You read the Warren Report - and then you tell me you're satisfied Lee Oswald shot the President all by his lonesome.
Some people would say you're paranoid.
I could give you a false name, but I won't.  Just call me X.
I haven't yet.  I don't have much of a case.
Well, thanks for coming.
...don't think so.  When they start to drool, they get rid of 'em.  These guys are proud of what they did. They did Dealey Plaza!  They took out the President of the United States!  That's entertainment!  And they served their country doing it.
You never ask a spook a question. No point.  He'll never give you a straight answer.  General Y still thinks of himself of the handsome young warrior who loved this country but loved the concept of war more.
Here's my problem, Jack.  You told me you and Guy were good friends for a long time?
How much more?
Like I said, a fuckin' nuthouse.
Anyone else involved at Banister's level?
What's the problem?  What's the problem?  Do I need to spell it out for you, Mr. Garrison?  I better go.
Even my own wife, chief,  Who's wondering where I am?
Hate mail here.  Fan mail here.  The bad news is the IRS has just requested an audit on your income from this office.
Welcome, Mr. Miller.  Jim Garrison. Would you care for some coffee?
I know about that shot.  A terrible tragedy.  How much do you have for carrying on your investigation?
And you get of from school at 3 every day?
What are they?
Can I help you?
Tomorrow I'll talk to your probation officer. Karen's a good kid, but she's mad at you, because you lied to her. This business about your grandmother's funeral
But then you told her you were home.
I don't know. Maybe it's a language problem.  Anita, you ever cause this much heartache over something that could easily be avoided, I'll never write you again. You understand?
So you're gonna call Karen tomorrow?
What's the problem?
Uh-huh.
How'd you know where he was?
And you didn't tell the Police?
I'd say there's about, oh, fifty thousand dollars here. What would you say Ray?
What's she want?
Hi, I'm Detective Mark Dargus. L.A.P.D. can I ask what you have in that bag?
I doubt it.  Who's your friend?
Would I mind? Do I have a choice?
This is your money?
Help yourself.
What's this?
But now you're telling us now you do.
You don't want much, do you?
I don't think so.
You're not tired of it?
But they won't want to take you to trial. They'll offer you simple Possession, a few months of County time, and a year or two probation.  How 'bout another?
They wanted you to tell them what you know.
That would be Beaumont Livingston.
No, you didn't. What branch?
I used to bring over ten thousand at a time. That's the legal limit, so I never brought more than that.
Thanks, but I have my own now.
I couldn't wait till I got home last night and wash my hair.
'76?
I don't know yet. I'm going to talk with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do what you suggested. Offer to help and see what happens.
He told me last night.
He came by.
He needs me. Without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in Cabo. Sugar?
How'd you feel about it?
Does it happen to all men?
Make the delivery somewhere in the mall.
No, I mean you, right now. Not it you were somebody else.
A lot of reasons. But the main one would be I'm tired of it.
Yeah, that night I went to pick up a guy. I hear he's staying at this house, so I sneak in, wait for him to come home.
Got another gun and a stun gun...
What do you do when he comes home?
I'm not sure you answered my question.
What if he checks it?
In a dress.
How does Winston find him if A.T.F. and all the local Police can't?
That's why A.T.F.'s gotta make the case. I'm their witness. They wouldn't have a case without me. If it's his word against mine, who are they gonna believe?
Uh-huh.
I've chickened out. I'm afraid of him. He'll like that.
He's on to a new thing. He's after a guy who owns a gun shop he says is "woefully and wantonly" selling assault rifles to minors. He says he's gonna take him down if it's the last thing he does.
You tell those guys they'll have to do one helluva lot better than that before I'll even say 'hi' to them.
He say we like the same thing as married.
And what would this be, Sweet and Low?
We'll just be a minute.
You ever see him sell guns?
Ordell has a white guy working for him named Louis.
This afternoon before I came here. He was with Ordell at an apartment in Hermosa Beach. I don't know if he lives there, but I can find out.
She didn't say.
Yes. All those things are true.
How can I do anything if I'm being watched every second?
I got there early. I've had my eye on this suit -- Wait, let's start over. I got there early. The idea was to try on the suit, see if I liked it. If I did, get them to wrap it up, and change back into my uniform. That's what Sheronda's expecting me to wear. Go meet Sheronda, give her the bag with fifty thousand, and go home.
I didn't see him. I was in my underwear. If it was a white guy, it was probably Louis. He kill Melanie?
What were you two fighting about?
You already knew that?
The same guy who put me in, thanks a lot.
And what was your answer?
Yeah?
I understand woman, damn!
Yeah?
I got a problem...
Yeah.
You a fine lookin' woman, Jackie. I bet you do a damn sight better than okay. You think anybody followed you?
How the fuck they know that?
You told em? You told em it's me?
What the fuck's that got to do with it?
If you just listen, you'll see it's a damn good idea. The first time I do it they're lurking about. They see me hand the ten thousand to someone.
I don't know. One of your friends.
If you want.
The next trip, when I come with all the money, it'll look like I hand it to the same one I did before...
That's an agent. Manager's get fifteen percent.
The money's in a Broadway shopping bag. I get some food, and sit down here in the food court. Then your girl comes -- you got somebody yet?
Look, it's my ass facin' the penitentiary. You send some hard- headed roc whore, and she fucks things up.
Sheronda passin' the money onto someone else, that's what the hell I'm talkin' 'bout.
I know, but I hung around, 'cause I figured you'd try an' pull some shit like this.
Are you sure she don't know about the money?
What does she think she's gettin?
She waits for you to go in the place where you try things on.
Who's paging you?
Want a hit?
Four years?
Which one?
So where did you go?
That was taken at a place called "Flippers." It was in Hollywood. Were you in L.A. back then?
C'mon, don't lie.
Well, so far he is. But you have to admit he's not too bright.
Let him and that stewardess get that money over here...
Jesus Christ, get a grip, Louis.
What are you doin'?
Louis, this is it, man. I'm gonna make me a million dollars out of this. I already got me a half-a- million sittin' in Mexico. When I do this last delivery, I'm gonna make me another half-million.
Take the keys, man. Listen to music.
You ain't got to do nothing. Just point at it and push the button. You'll hear the car go "bleep." That means the alarm's off and the doors are open.
Louis, my man. Watcha doin'?
Whatcha watchin'?
Uh-huh.
What did he do?
She believed you?
She tryin' to work your ass against me, ain't she?
I still don't understand why you keep her around.
You shot Melanie?
Maybe forty, maybe not that much.
'fore I blow that bitch's brains out, I'll ask her.
Then she throws forty thousand in here, to rub the shit in my face, know what I'm saying? She wants me to know she ripped me off.
You know who I saw in the dress department?
I ain't givin' you fuckin' excuses, I'm givin' you reasons.
Whatever looks best and starts the soonest.
You're right, that was Ordell. You have time, you think you could find out for me where he's staying?
They don't have your winning personality.
So, you want a ten-thousand dollar bond. What've you got for collateral?
Who's it for? A relative?
The bond for possession is only a thousand.
It still sounds high.
Brown, Jackie Brown.
If there's no -- what do you call it -- confidentiality between us? Why would I tell you anything?
Falsely accused of Intent. If she had that shit -- and mind you, I said "if" -- it was just her shit to get high with.
You still there?
That's all?
How the fuck did he find me?
This place stinks.
My office.
She was afraid.
Now, is there anything you want to tell me before we get out of this car?
Hey, hey, hey. I think somebody's got some new clothes.
Ha-ha-ha. I'm serious, you smoke too much of that shit. That shit robs you of your ambition.
He ain't here right now.
Take me home.
Dead? No. I just hurt my back. I'm not dead.
I'm alive.
Dream on!
Go on Jake. She reads 'em like a book.
Do you want some help? I can call upstairs.
Something weird is going on here. What is it about us? Even in Nam it was always weird. Are we all crazy or something?
Grass never did that to me.
Daddy. Let go.
What the hell? What kind of mumbo jumbo ... ?
Hey, wait!
Daddy, what was that noise?
Doctor.  Ph.D.
I am.
Cars don't explode that way. Any simpleton knows that.
You think they're connected?
She said you were a son of a bitch and she regrets the day she set eyes on you.
She hates me, Louis.
What? She threw me out, remember. She wanted some professor to carry her far away from Brooklyn. Only we didn't make it. She can't forgive me that she still lives in the same house she grew up in.
Hmm. I don't suppose there are too many philosophers in the post office?
Jacob, I don't believe in demons, not in the empirical sense. I don't be- lieve in devils fighting for our souls. I don't believe in enternal damnation. I don't believe in other- worldly creatures tormenting us. We don't need them. We do a good enough job on ourselves.
What was that?
She had these real beefy thighs. Delicious.
Jacob, what can I do?
I don't know. Santa Claus. I had my son's picture in it. Gabe's picture. It's the only one I had.
I don't have to ask if you can feel that.
Jake, is that you?
Did you look around the headboard?
What's in here?
What?
Maybe it's all the pressure, Jake. The money. Things like that. Or your wife.
Why? What for?
What's it say? A hundred and two?
What does it say?
Don't gimme that.
Jezzie! My feet are throbbing!
Help me! Help me!
You know, you really ought to get out today. You can't just sit around like this all the time. It's not healthy. It's not good for your mind. Go take a walk, or somethin'. Go to a movie. Christ, who's gonna know? You think I care? I don't give a shit. Go. Enjoy yourself. One of us should be having a good time.  Hello! Anybody home?  Anybody in there?
Remember that.
How come? The army?
While you were in the shower.
It's just me.
Where were you, Jake? Where've you been? Why haven't you called?
It's amazing, you know, that a drug could change things like that, destroy a life and then give it back. It's hard to believe that the world could be so hellish on day and like heaven the next.
This is one of my dreams, Jake. Ever since I was a little girl. I never thought it would happen.
I can waitress. I'm good.
Bullshit!
Reasonable? Reasonable? Jake ... You're gettin' me angry.
Why won't you answer me?
That doesn't mean shit. Where do you come from, huh? And I don't mean Indiana.
You look upset.
Oh?  Where you going?
Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
Surprised, huh? I told you you'd know me. I've been tracking you for a long time. I just wish I'd spoken to you before tonight.
So first I'm arrested, right? Best LSD I ever made, right down the drain. I figure this is it, twenty years in the joint, if I'm lucky. That was '68.
Right. They were worried. They figured you guys were too soft. They wanted something to stir you up, tap into your anger, you know? And we did it. The most powerful thing I ever saw. Even a bad trip, and I had my share, never compared to the fury of the Ladder.
Don't worry. Take it. It'll free your head. Come on.
Here. I've got every credit card ever printed. Take this. Stay here till you can arrange to get away. It's on me.
How 'bout over there?  No wait. Do me a favor. Bring 'em to the back room.
You got a nice tan, though.
He'll never make it.
Well, don't we look better this morning? That was a hard night, wasn't it?
You look awake to me. Here.  Drink some of this.
No. No. You haven't had any visitors.
It's okay, Paul. It's okay.
Everywhere, like a plague.
Watch it punk, I'm armed.
That's nine to four, geek-boy.
That sucks. Why won't he go down?
Remember, stay calm, use your thrusters. We'll be fine.
Damnit to hell, you left me back there to die!
Bomb?
Can't shut em' down from here.
Okay that hurt.
Where have you been?!!
Thorgan, quit screwing around and come on!
It bought us some time.
You're a teacher.
Wait a minute...I need...
Yeah, I got ya. I don't see anything inside though.
Lab two, relax. What's the matter? He's dead.
Jesus, God!
Kicker, anything?
Jesus, Sarge, what is this thing?
Pull me in!
Where are you going?
Rizzo?!
They were all wrong. They couldn't control him.
Got it.  You ever space walked?
Rizzo, did they have chinese food in your time?
Delongpre, you don't even know me.
Now what?
Well?
Now hold on! We should hear her out!
Now that's just gross.
I'm missing two!
Fat Lou, we're changing courses for the Solaras Space Lab.
No...  That's the sound of the men working on the chain gang.
The air's laced with type two ozone, it reads as a solid.
The cryo unit leaked. The computers sealed the room. No airborne viruses no hazardous materials. I've shut down the until. Alright, stand back.
Almost done.
Yo, Teach, what the fuck?
How do you know?
Something's wrong.
The power's back up!
I gotta go back.
I'll reset our course . . . 3 hours?
How did I get here, how did you bring me back?
What good will that do?
Did you bring a check?
And incidental damages, if any...
And you get the Mayor off my back with this zoning crap. Nobody tells me how to run my property.
Let's call in -- we can radio and have a big boat here in an hour...
What's that one, there?
He's trying to sink us!
Colorful, isn't he?
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum.
Who's that young man?
He lost it on the way up.
You'd love to prove that. Getting your name in the National Geographic.
Forget it. This summer's had it. Next summer's had it. You're the mayor of Shark City. You wanted to keep the beaches open. What happens when the town finds out about that?
Officer, I wonder if you could tell me where I could find Chief Brody?
We ought to let it breathe... Whatever.
Drowning. Lemme ask you something. Is it true most attacks take place in three feet of water, around 10 feet from the beach?
There's a kind of a lone shark, called, uh...
Yeah. Rogue. Picks out an area where there's food and hangs out there as long as the food supply lasts?
He ate a car?
You're at the Institute full time? Or do you have a job?
Don't they have lifejackets or something? An extra boat?
We will. There's something I've got to find out.
I'm familiar with the fact that you are going to ignore this thing until it swims up and bites you on the ass! There are only two ways to solve this thing: you can kill it, or you can cut off its food supply...
What the hell?
Don't shoot him any more! He's crazy on his own blood already!
Quint...?
Think the tide's with us?
Y'know, I used to hate the water...
Think she might've run out on you?
Where'd you hide the 'Beach Closed' signs?
Better than Cousteau, or Compagno with computers, telemetry, Defense Department funding...
I don't need to pass basic seamanship.
Ha. City hands. You been counting money. If you had a $5000 net and $2000 worth of fish in it, and along comes Mr. White, and makes it look like a kiddy scissors class has gone to work on it and made paper dolls. If you'd ever worked for a living, you'd know what that means.
Hello, Junior. What are you? Some kind of half-assed astronaut?  Jesus Christ, when I was a kid, every little squirt wanted to be a harpooner or a sword fisherman. What d'ya have there -- a portable shower?
Face and head scars come from amateur amusements in the bar room. This love line here...  ...that's from some crazy Frenchie come after me with a knife. I caught him with a good right hand right in the snot locker and laid him amongst the sweetpeas.
I'll drink to your leg.
Carcaradon carcharias. A Great White.
Go Carole.  So, guess what?
Hey Juno... A couple of us are going to the cineplex after school to donut that movie with the guy with eighteen kids.
I'm going to really start looking like a dork soon. Will you still think I'm cute if I'm huge?
Hey Junebug, when all this is over we should get the band back together again.
You're mad. Why are you mad?
That's not how our thing works! I hurl the accusations and you talk me down, remember?
Why? Because I got bored and had sex with you one day, and then I didn't, like, marry you?
Well... thanks. I think I'm pretty much set until college on the Tic Tac front.
What, you mean as friends?
I was just bored. I only think school is awesome like, 80% of the time.
Wizard!
Mine too.
You're a part time lover and a fulltime friend. The monkey on your back is the latest trend. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Just like our moms and teachers!
Did you hear it's yours?
You should grow a moustache. You're a real man now.
Nails? Really?
That was my first instinct too. Or D.W.I. Anything but this. And I'm going to punch that Bleeker kid in the weiner the next time I see him.
Juno? Did you happen to barf in my urn? Mac, you know that nice urn by the front door, the one I got up in Stillwater? I found some weird blue shit, I mean stuff, gunk, in there this morning.
I have no idea how to spit this out.
Where the hell have you been, Junebug?
You could have sent it to them. Why would you drive an hour out to East Jesus, Nowhere?
Whoah. I don't want to see pictures. I don't need to be notified of anything. Can't we just kick it old school? I could just put the baby in a basket and send it your way. You know, like Moses in the reeds.
Did your wife send you up here to spy on me?
It's beautiful. I've always liked Gibson better than Fender.
I rock a Harmony.
What? I'm a pawn shop rocker.
Yeah.
Your guitar is named Kimber?
You're kind of a sellout, aren't you? What would the Melvins say?
I know what junk is.
What is it?
So, have you and Vanessa thought of a name for the baby yet?
My dad went through this phase where he was obsessed with Greek and Roman mythology. He named me after Zeus's wife. I mean, Zeus had other lays, but I'm pretty sure Juno was his only wife. She was supposed to be really beautiful but really mean. Like Diana Ross.
I weighed my options. But after all this, I'm glad I didn't, you know, get rid of it. I want to have it. For you guys.
Nothing. She just hates when I sit around watching movies and 'not contributing.'
Oh, Mark! Is this the baby's room? It's beautiful!
Oh God, you're one of those guys...
Oh, okay. Like this.
Only squares and nerds go to dances.
No. No, you definitely cannot do that, Mark. That's a big, fat sack of no!
A baby is not going to fix everything. Besides, I don't know if I'm ready to be a father.
Good. I'm good.  Did you finish that paper for Worth's class yet?
The tough part's almost over for you. I mean, my girlfriends always tell me the first couple months are the hardest.
Oh, okay. So... how are you feeling?
She's joking. Junebug has a wonderful sense of humor, which is just one of her many genetic gifts.
I guess I wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good.
I sort of already have.
Or...
Yo-yo-yiggity-yo.
Maybe it's just a food baby. Did you have a big lunch?
Oh my God! Oh shit! Phuket Thailand!
Aha! You love him.
Oh, gruesome. I wonder if the baby's claws could scratch your vag on the way out?
Well, maybe you could look at one of those adoption ads. I see them all the time in the Penny Saver.
The Penny Saver sucks.
What did you have in mind, a family of disturbed loners who are into gunplay and incest?
How do you know I'm so poisonous? Like, what if the adoptive parents turn out to be evil molesters?
God, you're getting huge. How many months has it been now?
Did you hear Bleek is going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
Obviously, we'll compensate you for your medical expenses.
What do you think? Custard or Cheesecake?
What to Expect says that readying the baby's room is an important process for women. It's called "nesting."
Why don't we let Juno go home and we can discuss this later on, okay?
Like what? Be a rock star?
We're actually, finally doing this?
One night we figured out how much bad luck he must have comin' from all them mirrors he broke...  Four hundred and ninety four years to work it all off... After he dies, he'll have to keep coming back to earth over and over and over...
You know I can fix that haircut for you, if you want?
What's this?
Your pictures. Can I see 'em?
You took this picture?
Adele... are you serious?
My momma's a beautician. Guess that's where I get it from. She wouldn't hear of my moving in with Early... on account of his just getting out of jail and all. Ain't seen her in nearly a year now. I wish she'd call me, just once.
...I wouldn't lie to you, Adele. . . I saw him kill that man.
What's up Adele? Dinner ready?
Yeah, and in California you never have to buy fruit 'cause it's all on the trees everywhere you turn...  ...and, 'course there ain't no speed limit out there, and all drugs are legal... And I heard your first month's rent is free; state law. I figure 'til we get settled we can just move around month to month...
Did you settle things with Mr. Diebold?
Can you believe thirty bucks for this room... for what? A lumpy mattress, that crummy TV and a crapper.
What the hell is this stuff?
You gonna talk to the people who did those murders?
This the book your writing?
How did he get away with it for so long anyhow?
You don't sound too convinced 'bout that?
You two been busy in here.
Executing the killer wouldn't bring my mother back.
The warehouse. I'm not that drunk.
Jesus... They've probably got five bucks between them. Turn around.
...Soon as he finishes his thesis.
Bri'.
Tell ya Bri., I'm still a little sleepy,... think Adele and me are gonna take us a fiesta.
Darlin' you were 'bout that far from spendin' the night at the morgue. You understand?
...The police were way out of line when they stopped you from beating that bartender half to death. And no doubt God'll be pickin' on you on Judgement Day...
His Parole Officer.
Looks like somebody cut off his ring finger.
How many times have you gone unprotected?
Were they wearing condoms?
I knew you fucked it! I sat out here for like two hours! That girl was like twelve, and you hit it up!
Oh man, that's the best.
Yeah. It's like all I think about now. Not just that, it's like lately during sex, I start dreaming about these complex fantasies.
I mean I'm dreaming about going all out, crazy shit.
Shit.
Get another forty.  Smoke a blunt.
Probably.
Did she suck your dick?
Why?
It is right.
And once I saw this episode where they pretended they were each other. Where they lived the other's life for a day. You know those guys share everything, right?
That girl you boned last year. Remember?
Man, this guy is really good.
I wanna fuck Darcy.
I don't care motha fucka. I'll bet you money she fucks me.
Yo, you got any weed around here?
Casper.
Where you at?
Man we fucked him up.
What?
Sup then? Sup?
Come on. Come swimmin' with us.
No. I can't. My mom won't let me have boyfriends.
Yeah. His parents are away. It's gonna be a bug out.
Nothing. I'm telling you I just want to make you happy. That's all. Just trust me.
What is it?
You know what I want to do?
I don't know. I just think that you would love it.
Come dance.
Telly is at Steven's?
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
No, not everything? The sun is still shinning. It's a beautiful day out. Some things are OK. Right?
Did you and your boyfriend just break up?
Yeah. I'm not saying you should get a tattoo. But you should make yourself happy.
Oh hi Jennie. Do you want to come make out with me?
Hell yeah. I love. I love sex.
I gotta go. I gotta find Telly.
Yeah. Have you seen Telly around?
What happened?
Do you know where he went?
Who, Benny's little sister?
I'll ask you one last time. Do you have diss digg?
Yep.
Yeah.
Me. I can only take it up to fifteen minutes. Cause I get bored.
I made her get tested with me because I didn't want to go alone.
I hate 'em.
Yep.
Slow.
Yeah. And it takes them either too long or too short to come. Have you ever had someone that took forever
What man? What is it?
He says on the photo he'll call tomorrow at eleven.  Why not come back then and listen for yourself.
Meaning, it looks like his victims are chosen at random.
What do you mean, no?
No.
You got it on the board.
You sure you weren't over on Pine Road?
You set yourself up tonight when you attacked Kathy, you crazy fuck!
What are you talking about?
Sorry to ruin your trip to the city, but we got a real nut on our hands, Frank.
Take it easy.  Both of you.
Sorry.
The F.B.I. has nothing remotely similar to this guy.  I think he's a first- timer.
How is she?
What is it?
Ready for round two?
Now that you mention it there was somebody who looked suspicious.
Hello, Peter.
Why did you write remember on the wall?
I did another one last night.  You might have saved her, but you didn't want to play.
You'll find her.
Just like who?
I'm just trying to play the game.
And you want these girls to feel your pain?
Huxley's quote also says, "his play is always fair and just."
Have you any idea what the message is?
What?
That wouldn't be very sporting. Remember Huxley?  "His play is always fair and just."
Sure.  We've got a modem line hooked up with the data base in New York.
No problem.  We're in.
There's three.  The first is 1983. Lionel Baines.  The Boston...
Computers.  That's how you got into Homesearchers records.  You can get into anything.  But why?  Why?
Would you mind keeping your voice down? I have guests.
I admit I handled it badly.  Sanderson wasn't going to talk to me... but you're young, attractive--
They asked who would be best suited for this and you--
That's only because you don't know where to go.  You like hiking?  Fishing?  Sailing?  What do you like?
Any sign of rape?
Before we go in I gotta tell you this isn't going to be pretty.
You never know how you're going to catch a suspect.
Well, I think you have to play to his ego.  He thinks he's superior.  The more secure he feels, the more chances he'll take.
It can't be a coincidence.  The woman that owns it has a son.  She says he's been on vacation in Montana for the last ten days.  We're trying to locate him.  There's also a cleaning service that comes in once a week.  We're checking that out too.
What time did he get there?
We can't rely on your judgement anymore.
I know.  You won two games against him and left the auditorium at eight forty five.  Where did you go after that?
This is a printout from the hotel computer for all the messages logged to your room.  Here's one at 9:04 pm.  It says:  From Debi.  Please call me at home.
Another one?  What word did he leave?
It's a commercial area.  No one lives there.
As large as castles, you are still light as the air, one hundred men can't move me.  It's posed as a question. What am I?
He's not going to give us direct hints. He's going to skirt around it.
A shadow.  What's as big a castle?  As light as air , but one hundred men can't move it?  The shadow of the castle.  Are there any buildings that have the name Castle in it that cast a shadow long enough to fall across another building?
Where were you last night?
Answer the question.
About what?
She went into town with Mrs. Lutz.  Did they get him?
Of course.  Yes, here it is.  Why, they're all the same?
I love this hotel.  I stay here every time I visit my parents.
Are you one of the players?
--but you enjoy being the stronger one? You like the control.
Are you disappointed that I won't answer you?
Well, I think I've had enough.
You sure you don't want to eat something?
I think it's interesting.
In a way.
Take your average cop.  They deal with death everyday.  If they let emotions get in the way it would cloud their judgement.
You mean like in the steam room?
She died in a car accident.
It's alright.  It was a long time ago.
I thought you were the woman who didn't want to get involved.
Did you call?
Nothing.
Exactly.  It's the key.
It's over now.
Take off your clothes. I'm going to scrub you down.
We're almost married.
I lied.
Lyssa ... Lyssa ...
Have they harmed you?
Lyssa. Where are they keeping you?
In the Arctic ice.
Your powers are greater than you know.  Have you ever seen one of these?
There is no other way.
But it opens onto the sheer wall of the Needle. There's no way down.
I am too old to climb down a rope.
No. They occupy the Fortress, but they cannot control its movement. It is moved by Fate. And, sooner or later, Fate will place it near us.
They know when they're going to die?
The first time, when they attacked long ago, was The Beast here?
Lyssa? <u>Why</u>?
You must move quickly. The Beast will stop at nothing now.
I know the cruelty of such a fate.
It could have been quicksand! I might have been sucked to my death.  Where is this place?
Not yet, my friend. It's your tomato that's dying.
And in the few seconds before I dice you to crow-food, tell me why I am going to follow you.
And where do you lead, boy?
It should be an interesting journey, then.
When did you last sleep, boy?
I'm not hungry.
Forgive me, my friends. I saw terrible things.
We must cover a hundred leagues before sunrise.
My heart stays here.
What kind of a boy are you? Boys always have candy.
You do?
If I could wish ...  ... for anything, I'd wish for a venison pie the size of a ...  ... mountain. No, that's too greedy. I'd settle for one the size of a house.
What? Now you poke me in the nose as well?
Not working? This nose? This nose works day and night. This nose has never loafed an hour in its life. This nose ...  What?  Impossible. This nose asleep while venison fills the air?  Where is it, boy? Tell me where it is and I forgive you everything.
Oh, she was so beautiful - and I was so <u>ugly</u>.
Put me down, you lout!
And do you think I live on air?
Passable, pimple, very passable.
He didn't join them. They joined him.
He will come for me.
Lord Rowan is one of Lyssa's godfathers. He will defend her in the ceremony. I wish that Lord Modred were here. He is a godfather of her own blood.
I will tell you something you did not know, Turold. Had it been my choice, all those years ago, I would have chosen you for my king. But my parents chose otherwise.
Sixty at the needle, another thirty in the forest. Only ten of us made it back.
We seek the Fortress of Krull.
Perhaps she will not kill me, for I know her name.
Look.
Who speaks that name!
But you would not stay with me.
She bore you many children?
You had left me! I kept silent out of rage.
Knowledge.
A young man seeks her. A young man about the age I was when I met you.
What's that man's name?
Give me his name, I will mail him.
Yeah, pal! And I didn't say anything, I said I don't know you.  But do you know what did she say, that stupid Raphaella?
Look. When you can see his fingers, it's 50 meters.  When you just see his hands, it's about 80 meters. When you distinguish arms from body, it's 120-130. When you see nothing more than a shape, you don't shoot.  Not very sure. You have one chance out of five to miss.  A contract means getting all chances on your side. 5 out of 5.  You can't miss a client. Never... If the task is delicate or the risk is too big, you double. That is, you insure yourself by another means.
Wow! It's brilliant!
Good! First shot!
The yellow and pink.
It's strange, being in love... It's the first time for me...
Well... Then may you rent me your gear for the day?
...I'm going to kiss you.
...No...
How many girlfriends did you have?
Why? Did you have too many and you fear it may shock me?  I won't get shocked. I'm used to this!  My father was a true pig. He fucked the bitch I'd as mother all around the apartment. Whenever a door was closed, you could be sure they were making sex behind it!  And my sister, if you didn't sleep with her, you're building's exception!
...I had a girlfriend... A long time ago.  Before coming here, in my country. I was 14-year-old... We flirted like kids...  Her father didn't want her to meet me.  My family was not very respectable.
What do you do, with the money you earn?
Maybe it's the time to do something, isn't it?
Why did you unleash the pipe, I don't know?
You say it just to calm me!
Huh! You made an error, baby.  I don't know any Danielle.
Don't fear.
...Composer.
Yeah, but he's not exactly my father...
Because you have to pay.  It's like a parking meter: if you stay, you pay. It's the rule...
But... He works for your same employer?
...Who sent you?
Do you recognize him?
This smells good.
Here comes the resume.
Uncle Maurice, you're wearing sneakers?
Are you two planning kids?
What would you like us to do?
Mine.
This is Indiana -- nothing's going to happen to you.
Oh the preacher's getting angry again...  Tell me something.  Did she die instantly or did she feel every torn muscle and shattered bone? Were you there to help her?  Or were you safe at home when the windshield sliced into her face --
I know what you're getting at.
What it is -- is the truth.
Is this going to be similar to the flower incident?
I want children.
... People that were made to be parents, and people who were not made to be parents... My parents, were people who were not made to be parents but had kids anyway.  I don't want us to be that way Ellen.
Maurice?
The beach of Pacifica, California.
To where?
From where?
Most certainly.
What's his story?
You know what... I'm just little now, but I'll be big soon.
I thought you were asleep.
There was a boy named Isaac who wanted to play baseball, but he was too small and no one would let him play... but he kept practicing by himself -- waiting... He went to every game and sat in the stands with his glove.
Okay nine.  Big Billy's team was losing and he was on base.  That's when Isaac came up.  He could barely hold the bat... Big Billy winked at Isaac... The ball was pitched -- Isaac hit the ball hard. It soared up and out over the stadium.  Everyone cheered.  Isaac hit a home run and won the game. After the game, Isaac asked Big Billy why he let he play.  Big Billy smiled and said, I wasn't always Big Billy, I was Little Billy first... Isaac and Big Billy went off after the game and read a classic book together.  The end.
Each inch represents 150 miles...
This story is big huh?
What are you saying?  This story is too big for this paper?
Michelle, breathe... that's it, what is it, talk to me.
Umm, he's going to make it isn't he?
It has to be a full character's name.
This is a ghost town.  Nothing ever happens.
You going on a trip Mr. Parker?
The hairs on my arm are standing up... Something strange is happening.
I need to show her how much I love her Kris.
Pacifica, California... that's a long ways away.
Mr. Parker, you can yell at me, if it'll help.  But I'm not risking your life.
They told me, you might try to talk me into something... You need to rest Mr. Parker... It's for your own good.  I've been following your story for a long while.  It's a beautiful thing you did.
Good morning.
May I ask you a question that might sound strange?
Hello, Mr. Parker.
He wants to reward you... That's why I'm here.
There's a one-drink minimum per show, I hope you saw the sign when you came in. Anyway, they're supposed to tell you.
Everything's ten dollars, and there's no alcohol.
Sarah -- with an H?
Do you want to fuck now?
What's the story? Are you too drunk to come?
...or a girlfriend, but if you have some free time... maybe we could have dinner.
I think you know I'm serious. I'll pay you if you like... but I'd like to see you.
This is the home of an angel.
I'm from the East. I went to college, did an arts course. I now live in Vegas. I think of it as home. I came here deliberately to carve out a life. I was in LA before, but I'll come back to that later.  The tough times are behind me now. I can deal with the bad things that happen. There will always be dark characters. But my life is good. It is as I would want it to be. So, why are you a drunk?
It wasn't so important to me. I mean, he never asked me why I was a hooker, and that was impressive. I really liked him. So I decided to just play my part. I mean... it's good to help someone once in a while, it's a bonus to being alive, and that was my plan... to stay alive. I suddenly came to a decision.
I don't know.  I'll go and sort it out today. Why don't you come?... We'll find a real room for me. You can pick it out, a tower on the strip.
Sera you are crazy.
Ben?
Giving you money makes me want to come.
I am planning to go out and do some work.
Thank you, Sera.
Maybe I should follow you around and ask one of your tricks what it's like to sleep with you.
Years ago, in LA, I turned a trick on Sunset and Western. The guy was polite and didn't argue about the price. He parked his car and I took him to a house that I had an arrangement with. A fat Mexican woman was watching a TV and I told him to give her the twenty for the room. There were three or four small naked children playing on the floor and we had to step over them to get into the room. The room had a bed and a dresser. He lay on his back on the bed and I put a rubber on him and sucked him for a while until he was hard and then I eased on to him. About twenty minutes later there was a knock on the door and it was the woman saying our time was up. I felt kind of guilty because he hadn't come and I offered to reason with the woman and get another ten minutes, but he said it was all right and began dressing. When we were ready to leave the room he stopped me and... hugged me and kissed me on the cheek. He gave me an extra hundred as a tip and went back to his car. I remember being relieved that I wouldn't have to work again that evening.
You know I love you... yeah?
Hey, Brad... how's it going?
How'd this happen?
Where are you staying?
But it's a top three school --
Yes, but your major is Fashion Merchandising. Harvard won't be impressed that you aced "History of Lycra". What are your backups?
Why would I kill my husband?
What're you so happy about? You're on trial for murder.
But is he an ass that's gonna win my case?
I'm a Delta Gamma and I'm a huge fan of yours!
It's so shameful...
I got out of the shower, walked downstairs, saw her standing over my father, and called the police.
No.
Did you hear a shot fired?
Yes, Your Honor. Had you ever gotten a perm before, Miss Windham?
How many, would you say?
Chutney, why is it that Tracy Marcinko's curls were ruined when she got hosed down?
Huh?
What are you talking about?
I think it's time discuss your career path. Have you thought about where you might be a summer associate?
Mr. Salvatore, do you have any proof that you and Mrs. Windham were having an affair?
What's going on?
You're asking the wrong girl. I'm with my guy eight years and then one day it's "I met someone else. Move out."
So, what's this Sarah got that you don't? Three tits?
God, that felt great!
I feel so bad for her. I mean, she's in jail! And she's innocent. But I'm the only one who believes her. Donovan totally thinks she's guilty.
It's not my alibi to tell --
You almost had me fooled.
Josh proposed!
Keep June first open -- you're one of my bridesmaids. And give Warner our love.
Good luck.
Explain to me why you're so anti- Brooke.
So?
Okay, how would it work?
What the hell is that for?
Hey --
Whoa -- Why?
As long as you realize I'm not just some man-toy you can show off like a trophy.
Thank you, Serena, but I don't think it'll do any good.
Oh, he is so over on this campus.
What?
You guys -- I can't. We're in the middle of a trial.
Neither.
Yes? Ms. Woods?
I don't know --
Maiden name -- Daniels.  You know her?
Class schedule, map, book list.
You know -- mixers, formals, beach trips.
I'm sorry, Elle, I just --
That's not entirely --
Elle, believe me, I never expected to be doing this, but I think it's the right thing to do.
Oops! Time for class. Meet me after? On the benches?
I'm sorry, I just hallucinated.
Wow. You're a walking felony.
Well, yeah, but --
If you tell him, you'll probably make summer associate. Who cares about Brooke? Think about yourself.
In court. On opposing sides.
Did you ever take Mrs. Windham on a date?
But I guess it wasn't enough for Brooke.
Hovering?
You passed Spanish because you gave Professor Montoya a hand-job after the final.
Why so few?
Fool's magic.
Birdies... pretty...
My generosity is not so large as that.
Jack... Oh, Jack... Help me...
Now I want to live forever.  I've never felt so strong or happy.
Yes.  I feel that, too.  Weakness is what is ugly.
You got no idee.  People there lookee diffelent; speakee diffelent. Nothing the same.  In my countlee I bling good luck.  Makee lain and thunder.
Flozen foleva not good.
An' how you do it?  How you rift cuss?
No... I... I need to rest.
I've laid eyes on no mortal but you this day, Jack.
Elderberry wine.  No finer drink under heaven.
Why has this happened to the world? Why is it winter now, and dark?
True... But it won't come easy or free.  If ye want to ask, ask Jenny Greenteeth.
Twill take more than heart.  Where do we find the armor of Achilles, for a start?
I'm small... and I can make myself smaller still... Small as a bee! Small as dust...!  Want to see me do it?
How do you plan on finding this here castle, if ye don't mind me asking?
I'm sure.  It spoke to me.
Beware.
Aye.  He's enchanted the lot of them.  His reward for delivering the unicorn.
Shhh!  Not so loud, mayhap he'll hear ye.
Tis not the sword that counts, but the man what swings it.  Rest easy, Jack.
God's blessing.
Wait!
Is she... dead?
Never knowing when it takes a turn or changes course.
Why not admit it, Honeythorn Gump. We've lost our way entirely.
Never felt so cold in all me born days...
Give in to despair and all is lost.
There aren't enough arrows.
Aye.  We're good as inside.
She's sore hurt, Jack, tis true, but not dead yet.
Sunlight.
Ever wondered why Jenny Greenteeth said you needed the fastest steed on earth?
Not in the mood, I'm afraid.
I'll do anything... face any challenge!
By the pond.  She was teasing me.
She tossed her ring in the pond and bid me fetch it.  Said she'd marry me if I did.
Keep me belly full, Jack.  Kill us another worm.
You see!  You see!
Ogg lives there...!  And Thurgis!
We seek to undo the curse.
It's my father, gone a-hunting.  The Baron Couer de Noir is his guest and must be provided with some sport.
A promise is a sacred oath.
How much longer?
I am a princess.  You have no right to order me about.
Oh Jack, mightn't I touch one?  It would thrill me so.
I've no fear of failure.  Your implications are most unbecoming.
They tricked you.
Tis the truth.
There's no happier thought under heaven.
My heart intends no more than that you love me as I do you.
If wishes were horses even beggars would ride.
What have I done?
No!  Don't let go... you mustn't!  I love you!
Oh!  Green Jack!  What a dream I've had... proper nightmare.
Sweet Jack.  I'm so sorry you found me asleep.  Don't know what came over me.
Seemed like weeks and weeks.  Such a terrible dream... I could never tell you...
Oh no, dearest Jack... I meant every word.
Think me fair, do you, Jack?
Dear lad, what does winter bespeak but death?  It is a time of mourning.  This calamity is a curse. Something wondrous and beautiful has been taken from the world.
How do I get the horn back?
Nay.  Tempting as your invitation be.  Tell me one thing more.
I don't believe you.
As a hummingbird returns to the fairest blossom.
This is not the time for squabbling.
Never even had a sword in my hand until yesterday.
I live in an abandoned fox den neath the roots of a thousand-year-old oak.  My bed is pine boughs and rabbit skins.  There's no need of weaponry to keep the maids away.
I'd be honored.
That was in jest.
Sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind.
Praise be to God.
Your fond wishes give me strength, dear friends.
How came you by this blade?
Dad's disappeared!
He hasn't called?
Mom?
I couldn't get it to go down.
Oh...I set it to see if it would work.
What are you doing up so early?
Why?  What do you mean?
Sorry I got you into trouble.
Why?
Don't you have school?
I had them in my pocket.
It's not what I was expecting.
Do you remember me from when you lived here?
Josh and I are going to South Coast. Wanna ride?  Maybe see a movie?
I'm coming in.
Josh said...
Why is that?
Are you guys' friends?
Mr. Stevens?
I'm good, thanks.
I've been here twenty years.
What are you talking about?  You love your job.
Sam?
If she's not up, you can use my shower.
George, this is the third time.
I forgot where I put my keys.
Your mom and the boys can drop by anytime.
Because I live there.
I'm not going!
Mom, tell him I'm not going.  You already promised me!
I want you to take out your nose ring and leave it out.
I don't beg.
I can promise you complete privacy.
When are you going to be back?
Oh, so you're in the big shit now!  Child abuse.  People go to prison for what you just did to me.
I took some of your Vicodin.
If I asked you to stop, would you?
Why wouldn't she leave?
I would have killed him.
I loved him too much.
I mean, do you need to have surgery on it or what?  Because those pills you're taking are for a lot of pain.  And you're going through them quick.
I don't know what that means.  What kind of problem?
And you told Mom today?
We're all dying from the start.  I just got picked for Advanced Placement.
No.  A friend... your mother?  Everybody gets touched by someone they love.
It was in my name so he wouldn't lose it. He stole it from everyone that deserved it by putting me on title.
Your kid was down around Diver's Cover again, smoking pot.  I didn't write him up...told him I wouldn't tell you...
Ah!  Oh....
It's my day off.  I thought I'd help with the plumbing.
Why do you let your dog crap on his lawn, day after day?
Did Sam call to tell you he wouldn't be over this weekend?
I didn't think you'd know I went missing.
Four days.  I left to think.
The garage.
When's school over?
Last time you were gone for a week!
I was up on the roof this morning, tearing it down and it struck me as strong as anything ever has.  That I'm happy today.
Go in there and lick his attitude.
With your hands or your tongue?
It's been a while.
Tell him how you made me fall in love with you.
I thought we were helping.
When I picked you up from the train station...what you said.
Peter left me yesterday.
Back.  Neck.  Back.
What's your deal with Alyssa?
What the fuck?
The biggest waste of time since television.
I'd love to drive through New England in the Fall.
I can't go right now.
Despite you.
You got a dog?
I've missed you guys.
Go tell your father we're eating.
They ain't men, Mae Rose. They're convicts. And nigger convicts to boot. Can you say nigger?
A night in the hole?
He's a big one.
Don't take it so hard, Biscuit. She don't mean nothin' to him.
These are free papers.
We get the games on the radio sometimes.
Oh, no, Ray. Not tonight. Spanky's not happy with you.
Do yourself a favor and find another place where they let you in the front door.
Sharp.
Married?
Damn dentures slipping again. Everything falls apart when you grow old, eh, Claude? Time sure marches on.
Season tickets to the Yankees. Right there on the first base line.  What's wrong, baby?
Did you go see my cousin Maynard like I asked you in my letter?
Yeah, that side of the family has all the looks and none of the brains. I hope he don't mess things up.
Claude. That's my name. Claude. That's never happened before.
Where they taking us, anyway?
Come on, daddy-o. You haven't said a word since we started. Least you could do is make some friendly conversation.
Well, maybe I should dig around in other people's clothes for money. It's obviously been highly successful for you.
The Negro League don't pay so good. And you're always on the road. That don't wash with Daisy.
How would I get a loan, anyway?
Like this?
When there is, you can forget about it. And I swear to God, you ever talk about my daddy again I'm gonna kick your bank-telling, loan-denying ass, you got me?
Nice meeting you? You've been here before, haven't you?
Well, not exactly. See, I met this girl. Real nice girl. God-fearing girl. Her name's Sylvia.
You lost all our money in a card game?
What ain't there?
Well, if you're still thinking about booking it, I want in. I think we can make it.
No.
You did it, man! You got us out! Next stop, New York City!
Red Sox... Who's on the mound?
Better watch yourself Claude, before you say something you regret.
Well, if that's the way it is...
I hope you don't think I owe you anything. Because I don't owe you a damn thing.
Damn, it was getting hot in there.
You sure it was him?
I don't like it, I don't like it one bit. We shoulda taken that car when we had the opportunity. We'd be half way to New York by now.
No, I'm gonna kill him --
I can't do it.
Don't tell me, I don't want to hear it. It's probably all fucked up, anyway.
Just put some mustard on it and eat it.
Soft and supple. Like a lady's.
How about some steak sauce?
He's from New York City. That one, too.
Maybe I oughta eat your corn bread.
Hell of a way to get out. Heard they burned up in that fire yesterday.
What do you think about that?
1932? That's like, that's like...
Mama?
I can't take that, mama.
I can't believe this. I always said I'd never end up like this. I thought I'd make something of myself, do something with my life. You know, be successful. Have a big house, a family. Now I'm gonna end up just like daddy.
They gave me life, mama.
Hunting's been pretty good on the farm the last few years. It's one of the perks of the job. If you're interested, tomorrow I could show you some of my favorite spots.
I oughta shoot you for that comment, boy.
Who?
Hey, Ray, what's the name of that nightclub of yours?
I'm interested. Keep talking.
Adrian, you gotta come back to Hell. Dad's sick.
I am concentrating. Where can we rule?
"Let the sin begins" -- that was a good one.
Oh. My. God. I can't believe you're here. Welcome. Can I just tell you, I am so excited right now.
I remember that night, you had like four daiquiris.
The home of eternal damnation, house of Hades, H.E. double toothpicks...
I gotta help her. I gotta help Dad. I gotta help everybody.
But how can I win? Adrian is stronger and smarter than me.
Well, nice meeting you, Jenna, Christa.  Would it be okay if I called you Mommy?
Well, Mommy, get me to the big apple cause I'm gonna rock that town like a hurricane.
What's Nicky doing down there?
This is intense! And it happens every day? Sometimes twice? I gotta tip my hat to you people!
Go get a soda out of the fridge.
You have the power to change the cola in that can into any other liquid -- engine oil, bat's blood, moose piss. You just have to release the evil within you.
I didn't murder anybody
I'm sorry. After careful consideration, I regretfully have to decline.
Check one-two. Check one-two.
Nothing, Dad. Just re-arranging the furniture.
Now everybody sit down.
This was a very difficult decision, because I have three wonderful sons. I mean, Adrian, so smart, so ruthless. And Cassius, so strong, so tough. And Nicky, so... so...
I don't care what kind of mood you're in at the start of that song. When it's over, that mood has been altered. Wow. Great shit. What's next?
You're a good devil, Dad.
That's a train, son. Don't stand in front of them.
Nothing's getting through that. The fire is solid as a rock.
So go get 'em, Jimmy!
I was in love one time but she said I wasn't financially reliable enough. And she needed that.
You sure you're down with this?
Looking for the chief.
It's "Comptoir Sud Pacific." Makes me feel like a hula girl. Which is kinda what I'm going for. Wanna come in?
Want to? A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back!
So you're saying, make all pants with a drawstring, then heavier set gals don't have to feel humiliated by telling their waist size in front of the whole store?
Nicky!
Yes. What is rent?
Off limits.
No.
Why is that funny?
It looks like the work of a brother...
You callin' me a thief, my man?
Okay, now you gone and done it. You done messed with my business bitch!
No cubs over fifteen, Billy! Ever heard of a cub with a green flower? You'll leave Cathedral then, Billy, when you're on green, because they won't let a green stay here.  If you try to stay the young ones will gut-rip you apart!
Where do you think we came from?
Answer the question!
I am.
Do you have anything special in mind?
But you don't know, you just say what everyone says. "One for one. One for one."
The damned Yellows are getting out of hand. Those three ought to be in Cathedral. No business scrambling in Arcade...
Now there's a few who could have been his seed-mother.
I think you've been skulling out too much. First Nursery and now stupid questions.
Why aren't you in Nursery?
What's wrong, Available?
And?
I'm listening.
Are you a 5 or a 6?
I couldn't get you out of my mind.
You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
Why show me?
I don't..
If you trusted me, you'd know.
I'd rather be with you.
Just follow -- no matter how it seems...
Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. But if I take you to them, they'll kill you.
Yes, but they won't know that... or care. They're hunting you, Logan. Maybe me too, now...
Because he's my friend --  and I don't want to be killed by him -- or anyone.
What do you suppose this was...?
I don't know what's going to happen to us Logan but --  Are you glad you didn't kill him?
You're really one of us now, aren't you?
What's that?
Don't!
...But I still have the choice...?
I'm going to try and tell people what we've seen and --
Is it inside the city?
You're both full of secrets like Macavity.  Did you steal this?
We'll have to bury him.
Hello, Sandman.
My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
What's beyond this place -- do you know?
Did your Mother or Father ever mention another place?
Are you ready to put him in?
We're leaving.
Thousands and thousands... as many as my cats?
Can you make it back?
No -- just there -- on the first level.  Don't look for us. We'll see you.
You're a musician?
I like to remember things my own way.
How'd the camera get so high like that?
Like you'd get if it was hand held.
You don't remember being awakened? It looks like you were aware of someone.
We've got Pete Dayton's prints all over this place.
I was here yesterday.
Can I call you?
Hello.
Hello.
Have you partied with him?
In pornos?
So, should I call Andy?
'Cause that's how long it's gonna take, baby.
Alice...
Dick Laurent?
Better.
Okay. Thanks.
Yeah.
Goin' out with these clowns for a while.
What's up?
Never saw him before in my life.
Please tell me.
His condition? What do you mean?
We saw you that night, Pete.
Repeat that, Bill.
Where is he now?
If he's not Madison, then where's Madison?
You just gonna let him go?
Now, Mack, what's the situation?
I want to see him.
What is this, Rogoff?
He's not Madison?
I examined Madison last night, Marshall. He had a headache.
There's no other bedroom?
Headache, huh? Too much sun, I guess. You want to come in?  Still got forty- five minutes outside if you want it.
What's bothering you, Madison?
What is it?
At your house. Don't you remember?
Of course. In fact, I'm there right now.
From the club. You didn't answer.
We've got to call the police.
So?
Where would you feel safe?
I'll make sure the alarm is set from now on.
Beautiful! Smooth as shit from a duck's ass. Let's take a ride.
Sorry about that, Pete, but tailgating is one thing I can't tolerate.
Yeah. Give ya a boner.
I'm leavin' the Caddy, like I told you. Think you'll get a chance to give her a once over today?
If you think you can finish it, I'll be back later today.
Hello.
Mr. Eddy?
Look... It's late, Mr. Eddy... I ...
You want some company?
You sure weren't acting like the Pete Dayton I've always known.
Why don't you like me?
I was?
All of it?
Two years!?
I beg your pardon, brother. What did you say you were hunting?
Fossils, huh?
Found in Asia!
Sorry.
Don't call me brother.
I see.
Is it?
Left us here to rot. That's what they've done. Heroes of the newspapers!
And say, honey, you look a million per cent better. Wholesome, kind of - and clean. You take a tip from me, and don't you ever put that stuff on your face again. Why, it's like hiding behind a mask.
Certainly not.
And this trip to the valley. I can't imagine why I'd allow you to drag me down here. Why, we don't know anything about these people. We're not even armed!
Chalmers Bryant!
You see? You get the idea? From this reservoir here I can pipe in the whole works. Oh, I'm going to get a great kick out of this. Of course it's just to keep my hand in, but with the equipment we have here, I can put a plumbing system in for the whole village down there. Can rig it up in no time.  Do you realize those poor people are still going to the well for water?
Oh - that! That can wait. Nobody's going to run off with it.  Say, I've got to get busy. I want to show this whole layout to Chang.  So long. Don't you take any wooden nickels.
Say, you're an American, aren't you?
Cave, eh? Where?
Hey - look!
And mine's Conway.
You will need suitable clothes for the journey. It is not particularly far, but quite difficult.
Oh, yes.
You know, that's the fourth time you've said that today. You should have a record made of it.
Oh, good heavens, no!
Well, it must have taken
buy and sell?
Very often.
Young? She arrived here in 1888. She was 20 at the time. She was on her way to join her betrothed - when her carriers lost their way in the mountains. The whole party would have perished but for meeting some of our people.
You must prevail upon him not to attempt the journey. He could never get through that country alive.
Please calm yourself. You'll soon be well if you do.
I'm sorry, but we have no doctors here.
You know, it's very, very strange, but when you saw me in the corridor, I was actually on my way to you. I bring the most amazing news.  The High Lama wishes to see you, Mr. Conway.
I don't mean it in that sense. I only give credit where credit is due.  Er, Mr. Chang, I'm very anxious to have you realize that I never for a moment believed that ridiculous kidnapping story.
Isn't it? Isn't it! You know I was a professor for twenty years? - and a very good one.
We were just going to bury him when you came along.
In that event, we better make arrangements to get some porters immediately. Some means to get us back to civilization.
Oh, yes. There is a tribe of porters some five hundred miles from here. That is our only contact with the outside world. Every now and again, depending upon favorable weather of course, they make the journey.
A fine trick! Smart, aren't you? What a pack of lies you told us about those porters! Of course the minute they arrive, we can make arrangements to leave. If they take us. But you knew very well you'd tell them not to!
I trust you have been comfortable at Shangri-La, since your arrival.
Sondra Bizet.
Yes, of course, your brother is a problem. It was to be expected.
The power house - they've blown it up! The planes can't land without lights.
The next time you're in wild country like this, keep in touch with the British Consul.
Just what I needed too.
He's dead.
We've had plenty of it the last few days.
George, I've been putting things together. Do you notice the resemblance between those natives and the pilot? And why did those clothes materialize so conveniently when they met us at the plane? Chang himself just said that they never venture beyond that point. What brought them there? Unless it was to meet us?
Uh-huh.
Well - I heard that if you want a man's wife, she's yours, if he's got any manners.
I said we're getting out of here. Back to civilization. I made a deal with the porters. They brought in a load of books or something, and they're leaving tomorrow at dawn. They're waiting for us five miles outside the valley. Come on, get your things together. Where's your top coat?
Why not? What's going to stop me?
Well, I - I really don't know what to say. Except that you must be completely mad.
You've got to talk about it. What about me? You said they stole that plane to bring you here. I didn't want to come. You owe me some responsibility.
Look here, Bob, Ever since I can remember, you've looked after me. Now I think you're the one that needs looking after. I'm your brother, Bob. If there's something wrong with you, let me help you.
You can't take her away from here!
Because you can't. Do you know what will happen to her if she leaves Shangri-La? She's a fragile thing that can only live where fragile things are loved. Take her out of this valley and she'll fade away like an echo.
This would be funny - if it wasn't so pathetic. Why, she isn't a day over twenty!
The clothes?
Lucky thing for me you snapped out of it, too. You saved my life. I never could have made it alone.
Target practice again! One of these days they're going to hit us.
Where were you hiding?
What do you suggest?
Huh? I give it up. But this not knowing where you're going is exciting anyway.
Oh, please. I hope you're not going to run away this time.
As a matter of fact, all I saw was a little boy whistling in the dark.
I'm so glad.
Beautiful! I'm waiting for the bump.
Ouch!
It's not so bad, really. Some phases are a little sordid, of course. That's only to be expected.
Oh, the usual reasons. A world full of people struggling for existence.
It's the most annoying word in the English language. Did you ever hear a child torture his parent with it?  Mother's little darling musn't stick her fingers in the salad bowl. Why? Because it isn't lady- like to do that. Why? Because that's what forks are made for, darling.
Would you like to wring my little neck?
Be quiet! Fenner's the best pilot in China. He knows what he's doing.
Why, he's speaking English.
You'll wait till you rot!
You promised to come for tea yesterday. I waited for so long.
Please say you will. The days are so very long and lonely without you.  Please . . .
The hell happened?
The hell were you thinking?
...touch that.
Well... you know, when you say "normal," what, exactly...
From now on, you'll respond only to the name "Jay." You'll dress in appropriate attire specially sanctioned by the INS Special Services. You're not to stand out in any way.  Understand?
Bull... loney- Sir.  I'm sorry.  Sir, I'm sorry. Sir.  I just, I find it hard to believe that it didn't come from you.  I mean, everything here comes from you.
Look. I don't know why.  I could guess, however.  Maybe it's your attitude.  Or that you're not even close to a team player.  Or that you always seen to think you know more than your supervisors.
Cowan.  Do you ever think that maybe, just maybe, other people might be right and you might be wrong?
This is a neurelyser. it was a gift from some friends from out of town. I need you to look at it.  This red eye here isolates and measures the nature of the electronic impulses currently in your brain.  More specifically, the ones -for memory, which it will then block.   I said I need you to look right here.
Underground gas vein.  Next time, be more careful when you shoot off your guns.
I know, that's usually the only time I actually have a shot.  And what if I wanted to see her again?  I'd have to completely re-introduce myself.
What'd you do before this, anyway? Wait-- let me guess. Ice sculpture? Rock?
Ha ha.  No, really.
Well, one thing's for sure.  You could certainly lighten up.
I dunno.  Maybe it was baby supplies, Kay starts the car, starts to pull a U-turn.
Something's wrong here.
The radio show?
Oh, yeah?  Fill us in, why don't you.
I know what you're saying.  And I'm telling you I don't trust him--
What are you doing?
Maybe they didn't get here.  Maybe they've been here.
We saw it in the office.  It went from this big...    to big...   in a day.
It's marble.
Wow... this one's cool.  And it looks just like a shotgun.
I'm just wondering what's so great out there that everyone's trying to get to it?
I swear to God, that was not here two days ago...
What the hell does that mean?
Is it my eyes... or is that thing a little...
Yeah ... ?
Goodwill...
Did our friend announce when he's making his speech?
I just wanted to scare em.  So I go in to buy a starter's pistol-- you know, the kind they use at track meets that shoot blanks-- and this guy, he said if I really wanted to mess with with them, he had just the thing...
I mean, I dunno.  I've seen insects with really great camoflauge ability.  But never like this.
Kay?  What's your 20?
He's gone, too.
They're gone.
Yeah?  What's up?
Now, what are we looking at?  Keys.  Look at them all.  Why do we have them?  Mr. President?
The drowning woman.  Anne... But it was too late.  Her little girl was already gone.
Think, John.  Why would they set you up?
I'm so sorry... I just want him back... I want him back so bad...
You the sentry?
Why's he still a John Doe?  Why wasn't he ever ID's from an EYEscan?
You're part of my flock now, John. Welcome.
Tell me not to worry, John.
You understand that a week from now people are going to vote on whether or not what we've been doing down here has been some noble-minded enterprise or a chance to change the way this country fights crime.
She's worried about you.  And, quite frankly, so am I.
I can't.  They're following me right now.  They'll meet me there. They'll halo me.
Can you fake the cerebral output?
You can't run --
No doubt the Precogs have already seen this.
Seventeen minutes.
Chief, the investigator from the Fed is here.
You don't have to do this, Chief.
We can't grab it...
Go ahead.
I show time of occurrence, Friday at fifteen-zero-six hours.
Confirm with trig and image.
But it's not the future if you stop it.  Isn't that a fundamental paradox?
You're certain?
The fact that you prevented it from happening doesn't change the fact that it was going to happen.
Sorry.  Old habit.  I spent three years at Fuller Seminary before I became a cop.  My father was a minister.  Lutheran.
At least now you -- and I -- have the chance to make sure that kind of thing doesn't happen to anyone ever again.
Just go to the beginning!
Detective.  Nice of you to come down here.  Seeing as every cop in the world is looking for you right now.  Jesus, what's up with your eye?
C'mon, Rufus, you've been busted twice for felony hacking.
I scored a goal!
Okay... now let me time you.
I was looking for you...
I don't know -- I never saw his face.  All I know is, the next day I was out, so the guy must've had juice somewhere.  Look, man, you gotta go through with this.
Heal who?
How can you avoid a man you've never met?
What?
You said they're destroyed.
How do I even know which one has it?
Then how did he --
John said something about him being set up because he "found out about her."
You have an emergency call on your private line.
By fooling the system.  All someone would have to do is wait for Precrime to stop the murder from taking place, then, a few minutes later, commit the crime in exactly the same way.
So there is a way to fool the system?
This is Evanna, the team pilot.
Crime of passion.  No premeditation.  They show up late. Most of our scrambles are flash events like this one.  We rarely see anything with premeditation anymore.
Don't worry.  I'll bring him in unharmed.
There are two others in the room besides Anderton and Crow.
It doesn't matter.  He wins.
John Anderton was my friend!
What about your meeting?
He took out his gun and sat down to watch his home movies.  This is all in your statement, Lara...
You know I need to use you.
Wally, the other two can still function, right?
Hey. I don't know, I don't want to know. Far as I'm concerned, you're a good kid. I got news, though, without you here I can't keep on your friend. I got enough people pretending to sweep.
Yeah.
He'll be a minute, hon. You want some coffee?
Martel's and coke. One ice cube. In a snifter this time.
Yeah, snifters are for cognac --
What's the matter? You ain't got no snifters in this motherfucker?
Thank you very much, sir.
I don't know, Forum's pretty hot tonight. It might be hard to get in, though.
I don't get it. What do you do?
Okay. We got a lot happening here. Here comes the good part... Okay...
Should I fuck him?
He's great, right. Is he great?
I got news for you, Horrace got his ass out of there before you did.
Ricky's not wearing one.
It's daytime.
You're not my daddy.
Hello.
So, what kind of gig is this?
No. What kind of bachelor party?
Oh my god. What happened?
Bobby, this is a plumb gig. It's a bunch of young agents and it's at a restaurant. It's gonna be easy and we'll make a lot of money.
Will you cut it out! Get ready, we're already late.
She's downstairs with Ruth. Get ready.
No way that cocksucker's driving you.
Maxie's fucking with me. He put you with the spook to get under my skin.
Get your hands off of her.
Your dance is over.
C'mon girl. Eat up.
What's his name?
So, when's the drop.
He must have that shit troughed.
It sounds to me like everybody's just a little jumpy. And since all it is is a drop, the Welshman's got nothing at stake. I say we go to his 'troughed off' bar. It'll calm his nerves, we drop the bag, and we all get back to our lives.
Where's Ricky?
How so?
Yeah. The blaze. I bought her in '66. Hired a trainer, stall, whatever it was. That horse made me over a hundred grand. In 'sixties' dollars. You know what that is today?
I like you, kid. Why do you gotta make it so hard for me to take care of you?
I didn't say that.
Bobby. You're a bull terrier and I got you herding sheep.
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to? This ain't a fucking democracy. You want out?
Don't I put food on you're table? I sponsor your training, I take care of your girl and her little baby. I even pay that deadbeat friend of yours to push a goddamn broom.
I got a way we make everybody happy.
We try something out. There's someone I'm in business with named Ruiz. I want you to accompany him on a drop.  Just as scenery. Ruiz has his boys. I just want a big guinea with a busted up face to give him a deep bench. As a deterrent.
Yes, for expenses and such. Now, you'll be contacted on your pager as to where you should go. You each have been given an extra battery, so there is absolutely no excuse as to why a page would not be immediately returned. Am I making myself abundantly clear?
I already told you, I parked it for five minutes and I locked it with the club --
What's the plan?
What's that?
Where is the Soho Grand?
So, Jimmy, you know where this address is?
'Trustafarians?'
I'm on the phone.
So, it was a draw.
Fuck them.
Shit. Who we kidding? I know I suck, and I held you up for ten rounds --
Please. I got three inches on you. You wouldn't have landed a punch if I didn't let you.
Your first start at DB, it's against Fairfax, and you miss the fucking bus.
I gotta pick up the baby.
Nice work.
I don't know.
I'll get the girl.
C'mon, man...
How much was it?
Great. On my fucking room.
Don't worry about it. Just be smart.
I know you're not calling Jimmy.
It's on West Broadway. We can walk.
Shit. It's thirty-five cents. You got a dime?
So they said more than the address.
What the fuck do you have to complain about?
You know this guy?
You fucking nuts?
Fuck you. Go then. I'm taking the car.
What the fuck's going on?
Put that shit out...
We need guns.
That's cause you decided to get all tired all of a sudden.
No.
Eighty.
What about it?
Calm down.
I'm sorry...
Three and a half hours?
We rep lines? You know? Fashion?
I don't wear a white wig, I don't carry a gavel.
Yeah. I want it.
Cardiff Giant?
Again with the fucking China Club! What do I look like a fucking Persian to you?
Did you see that shit? Motherfucker.  You let in fucking Screech, dude? I'm waiting and you let in Screech?
Yes.  Would you care for another one?
Excuse me.
How do you know it's not drugs?
Don't drag my ass into this --
I'm not saying shit to neither of you.
And where is...?
Sorry, mates. Now there isn't even enough to go around...
Sorry about that. Where's your mate?
I can't yet vouch for the amount, unless you want me to sit here and count.
Is it nice?
So whenever we want...
Nigger, please. Don't even order that artichoke shit. West side guineas. Forget the drinks, Leo. We gotta roll. What do I owe you?
Can I borrow a piece of --
dollars in c-notes, a numeric pager, a double-A battery, and a first class round-trip ticket to JFK.
Yeah.
And here I thought you flew in some out of town muscle. How's it going, men?
I'll get it.
Keeps me out of the army.
Not this boy... I ain't fighting their war. I got my own. Right chere. Heard tell you're a good man to know.
Sombitch and I ain't never been to Beantown.
You ain't bullshitting me, is you, boy?
I like your heart and I like your style. You might just do, Little. Lessen you got to git back to that train job.
You looking good, Little. Real clean. Clean as the Board of Health. But you missing something.
It hit?
Sometimes you got a big ugly mouth.
Daddy, where's my money?
1, 2, 8 hit, didn't it?
Was you that high? Old man, I threw the slats at you. I said to combinate me.
Oh, sit down, man. What you tasting? I'm buying.
I'll give you back the 600.
Who the hell are you?
Putting all that poison in your hair.
The question is, who are you? You are in the darkness, but it's not your fault. Elijah Muhammad can bring you into the light.
Don't con me.
Then what you telling me to study in them for?
Aardvark, noun. An earth pig; an ant- eating African mammal. Man, that sounds like the dozens.
I knew you'd hear me. The white man is the devil. All white men are devils.
I can't.
I don't know how.
I'll have it tomorrow.
Is the program ready?
Folks are sitting out there today, not next week, expecting to hear our program.
What points?
You're from Detroit, near where I come from. You majored in education at Tuskegee. You're studying nursing and having trouble with your family.
No, good Sisters are rare. We need every one. Tell me something: how tall are you?
Just an idle question.
There's a few things you don't know about women, Brother Malcolm. They're possessive and vain.
I'm in Detroit.
Why are you looking at me like that?
Talk about what?
"Both women, in their 20's, charged they had had intimacies with Elijah Muhammad since 1957..."
No, what's the matter with you? Wake up! Are you so dedicated that you have blinded yourself? Are you so committed you cannot face the truth? Bembry is the editor of the newspaper you established. Ask him why your name hasn't been in "Muhammad Speaks" in over a year? Ask him why you rate front page in every paper in the country, but not a single sentence in your own.
Dear heart, you have to help me. I'm raising our kids practically by myself, while you're running all over the world. You don't know how many times the girls ask me when is daddy coming home?
Get some sleep.
I don't care about myself, my wife and four children were sleeping in their beds, they have nothing to do with this.
I'm gonna try and get some work done tonight.
I assumed...
Just what are you saying?
Let him finish.
And like a fool I believe it.
She know?
The average first offender gets two years for burglary. We were all first offenders. That's what Sophia and Peg drew --
'Lo. I've got to freshen up.
I better not come in.
How many you turning out?
Thank you, Brother; Sister, how are you?
All day since you and Betty left. Brother Minister, I have to level with you. They gave me a mission. But I couldn't do it. I love y'all.
Let me die then.
You're my father.
Sheeet, you ain't. I had aplenty.
You the man.
Yeah, girl; that's your story. When you gonna holler "rape," sister?
Hey, man, gimme some skin.
I'm tired of always playing the cops. I wanna be Bogart sometimes.
That ain't bad.
Baby, I love you. Take it easy, greasy. How about a snort?
You is something, Homeboy. My trouble is -- I ain't had enough stuff yet, I ain't et all the ribs I want and I sure ain't had enough white tail yet.
Yes, I am, Brother Minister. All I want is support for my children. He should provide for his children. That's all I want.
This is Malcolm, our new guest. We'll treat him like a brother.
I didn't know then that I was a nigger.
The last few days may represent the best police work of my life.
The same thing as you. Except, my reach isn't as long as yours. My father was a policemen, did you know that?
My family lives in Miami. Because of the death threats.
No, but I have to admit I thought about it.
Creasy...  I'd have liked to have known you under different circumstances.
[Senor?]
[What is his name?]
[Who pays you?]
[What's the PIN number?]
[Who's the boss?]
[Who's Tazinari?]
[The bible says, "Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good."]
[The cops call him 'The Dreamer'.]
Who's he?
[Hello Daniel. I've got your family and I want to negotiate.]
[The most important thing in life is family. And there you are. You have my family. What do you want?]
[There was no ten million dollars.]
Were you provided with a gun?
Your resume is impressive. Nine years in the Army. Extensive counter terrorism work. I shouldn't be able to afford you in my current state. What's the catch?
I'm here.
Bullshit. I've known you fifteen years. You don't visit.
No.
Are you going to quit? My last bodyguard quit.
There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City in the last six days. Four a day. What do you think about that, Mr. Creasy?
Did you like school, Creasy?
What are you doing?
No.
How's the ankle? Can you put your weight on it?
So how come you know so much about those countries?
You're late.
Where's my mother?
I'm tough, Creasy. I'm tough as you.
You don't drink like you used to.
I know because I go in your room and check the bottles.
Then be trained.
Be a swimmer.
Continue to play in the wrong key, like you're dyslexic.
The world of our children. How dare they?
Mr. Creasy, I wanted to make sure you have everything you need.
You're lying. I don't believe you.
And Lisa will be able to save face. We won't be the only family without a bodyguard.
[OK, repeat the drop instructions.]
Yes, mom?
I think he's been sick. He's alright now, but I think he's been very, very sick.
A man's worth can be judged by what he has or what he owes. Only the amount matters.
Creasy. Pinta likes him.
[And as long as we're talking information, there's something else as well.]
[Who's that?]
Pollo Pibil. Chicken and chorizo sausage. Hmmmh. They marinate it in lemon and orange juice. It's a stew really.
Yes. But if I traced Creasy to you, others will do it as well. Their facilities are as good as my own, if not better.
Millie's been after me to fix her up with a date, so I...
Hey, Herbie...
So waddaya feel like doing tonight?
That big girl that was sitting in front of us with the skinny friend.
We took them home alla way out in Brooklyn. Her name was Mary Feeney. What do you say? You think I oughta give her a ring? I'll take the skinny one.
Well, let's call her up. What can we lose?
Well, what do you feel like doing tonight?
There's a nice-looking little short one for you right now.
We gotta whole pot inna kitchen. We give you a plate-a your own.
I gotta pains in my shoulder too. I have a pain in my hip, and my right arm aches so much I can't sleep. It's a curse to be old. How you feel?
Oh sure.  This girl is a college graduate.
You come up here often?
I'm twenty-nine years old. How old are you?
Well, I wouldn't call it an elegant profession. It's in a lower social scale. People look down on butchers.
This is the kitchen.
Waddaya doing New Year's Eve?
Couldn't she find some sort of hobby to fill out her time?
What?
I'm just gonna get my cigarettes. I left them in my coat.
Oh, that's nice. So the doctor was wrong, wasn't he?
...so the whole book winds up, Mike Hammer, he's inna room there with this doll. So he says, "You rat, you are the murderer." So she begins to con him, you know? She tells him how she loves him. And then Bam! He shoots her in the stomach. So she's laying there, gasping for breath, and she says, "How could you do that?" And he says, "It was easy."
I always figure a guy oughta marry a girl who's twenny years younger than he is so that when he's forty, his wife is a real nice-looking doll.
Hello, Marty, when you coming home? Where you now? Because your cousin Thomas and his wife Virginia, they're here. They had another fight with your Aunt Catherine... I don't know...
Sure, Ma, it's okay with me.
Ma, when are you gonna give up? You gotta bachelor on your hands. I ain't never gonna get married.
Did you offer the young lady some fruit?
All right, Ma. I'll be back in about an hour, an hour anna half.
That was a nice girl last night, Marty.  She wasn't a very good-looking girl, but she looks like a nice girl.  I said, she wasn't a very good-looking girl... not very pretty...
She looks a little old for you. About thirty-five, forty years old?
I don't know! She don't look like Italian to me. Plenny a nice Italian girls around.
...I been talking about two nurses Leo and me picked up in a bar on Seventy-First Street.
So, Marty, lemme tell you about these nurses, Marty...
The nurses Leo and me picked up last night. We got a date with them tonight.
Hello, Ralph.
Waddaya mean, Ralph?
I can't do that, Ralph, because somebody already brushed her off once tonight.
Hello, Ralph. How'd you make out with those nurses last night, Ralph?
He coming home right now.
I'm sorry we gotta rush like this...
On accounta...
Listen, let's go downa Kaplans' apartment. They told us to come down.
Tommy...
I know what you're gonna say. A man's gotta stop being his mother's baby sooner or later. How many times you gonna say it? She's my mother, you know. I oughta have some feelings about her, don't you think?
Tommy...
How they goin', Losing Preacher? What do you hear from the Pope?
What do you want me to do?
Nice looking kid. Going to be okay?
I may need you to go to work practically immediately. But meanwhile perhaps you'd like to meet some of your fellow officers.
I mean, what were you doing? Were you a resident or on a staff someplace?
Is there any reason why we shouldn't know the name of it?
Pulse, slow, very little pressure.
I have great interest for America, his peoples and his custom.
You  must  open  me  up  again?
My name's Hawkeye Pierce.
You got directions?
Make it yourself, or is it real?
No, Hawkeye just said it all.
Must be Painlees Pole Day in the Shower Tent.
When will he be able to write?
We think the same way.
Wait a second...
Is that liquor?
Give us this day our daily...
Special Services in Tokyo are all for it. They say it's one of the main gimmicks we have to keep the American way of life going here in Asia.
Gimme three.
What for?
Lucky you didn't have your mouth open or it would have gone down your throat.
Very well, Your Majesty.  Congratulations, Frank. He picked you.
I'm not so sure the goddam thing's in his heart.
Please!  Face it, Colonel, you don't have us, we have you. Your boys blew this case, we bailed you out. We figure we ought to hang around a day to check the Congressman's kid, and we also figure to play some golf. So if that's okay with you, we got a deal.
Best thing you could do for all of us is grab some sack time.
For you, Trapper.
It's five minutes into nurses' shower hour. Where are they?
So what makes you think he'll play for us?
Might make kind of a social issue, not having any other Negro officer.
Captain Pierce, would I be imposing...?
Captain, I've been observing the nurses on your shift. But naturally your own opinion is more informed than mine.
All of them?
Oh, no. We have dull stretches every week or so, thank God, when there's nothing to do after midnight.
But I'm married.
You'd think now, with only six weeks before they ship me back home, it would be easier. But it isn't.
Dear, sweet Hawkeye.
Do you think anything between us could be impersonal? Or pure? You better forget logic, because you're proving why I shouldn't go to bed with you.
Be the longest short-arm inspection you ever held!
If a man isn't a man anymore, what's he got left to live for?
That's really what I came here for. See what you guys recommend.
In the direction you want to go.
And if I go to New York, the natives there will carry me? I don't think so.
Pain bad, Ho-Jon?
Okay, Lieutenant Dish. I guess she's already... involved with somebody here.
You don't aim to cause any trouble  But?
You work those kind of hours, you got to have rest. Which you can't get with somebody jabbering away on a direct line to heaven.
It's a nice idea. I mean it has style.
What's going on? Who started this?
If you say so, Henry. But remember my claustrophobia.
O'Reilly!
O'Reilly, what is it?  There aren't more choppers coming?
Thank you, Spearchucker. I'll certainly take a look at these. Where the hell did you ever get that name?
Well, there's one big satisfaction.
Never mind.
You're a couple o' sticks shy in your column, Ann.
Did you get it, too?
Would you be willing to say you wrote that letterand stick by it?
Huh?
Don't mind the Colonel. He hates people.
Oh, come on, now. This is serious. You're a man disgusted with all of civilization.
Yeah. No, no!  No! No, look. You don't have to smell the world!
Oh, look. I'm the umpire, and you just cut the heart of the plate with your fast one and I call it a ball. What would you do?
Now, look, John. Here's the speech. It's in caps and double-spaced. You won't have any trouble reading it. Not nervous, are you?
Oh, but you don't know how big this thing is. You should see the thousands of telegrams we've received and what they're saying about you.
How many people do you think we've talked to already, outside the radio, I mean?
Hello. Whenever there's a pretty woman around, er  This is my nephew, Ted Sheldon, Miss Mitchell.
Oh! Oh, it's beautiful, D. B. WellI don't quite know what to say . . .
Hello there. Well, well! If it isn't the man about town!
What for? I gave you fifty just the other day.
That's your father's diary, Ann.
No. I've had the whole army and navy searching for you because that's a game we play here every day.
The letter from John Doe.
Okay, sister, you get your job back.
I can read. I can read!
Looks all right
Duets? But can we trust him?
Okay, fellows.
No, you've got yourself a meal ticket and you hate to let go.
No sense in going up there! I been here for hours. He ain't here!
Had any schooling?
Where'd you play?
Hey, boss. Get a load of this.
Yeah, Boss?
I've seen guys like you go under before. Guys that never had a worry. Then they got ahold of some dough and went goofy. The first thing that happens to a guy
And when they get you, you got no more chance than a road-rabbit.
Well, I'll be doggoned if over forty people don't show up. 'Course none of us knew what to do, but we sure got a kick out of seeing how glad everybody was just to say hello to one another.
Well, anyway, II guess nearly everybody in the neighborhood came, except the DeLaneys. The Delaneys live in a big house with an iron fence around it and they always keep their blinds drawn, and we always figured that he was just an old miser that sat back counting his money, so why bother about inviting him? Until Grimes, the milkman spoke up and he said, "Say, you've got the Delaneys all wrong." And then he tells us about how they cancelled their milk last week, and how, when he found a note in the bottle he got kinda curious like and he sorta peeked in under the blinds and found the house empty. "If you ask me," he says, "they're starving."
No!
That man is gonna be on that roof. Don't ask me how I know. I just know. And you know it as well as I do.
Sure, you are.
Gimme mine. I ain't staying! You know we were headed for the Columbia River country before all this John Doe business came up. You remember that, don't yuh?
Hey, stop worrying, Colonel. Fifty bucks ain't going to ruin me.
You win, Colonel. Here's the fifty. Go on out and get rid of it.
Tear down all the fences. Why, if you tore one picket off of your neighbor's fence he'd sue you!
Look, D. B. I'm supposed to know my way around. This John Doe movement costs you a fortune. This convention's gonna cost plenty.
Run a story. Say John Doe was in here, and is sorry he wrote the letter and
If you ask me, Hank, you're playing around with dynamite.
Did you write that letter to Miss Mitchell?
What's your name?
Look, Mr. Norton, I think you've got a lot of nerve having those people hold us here.
Now, hold on a minute, young man! Hold on! That's rather big talk! I started the John Doe clubs with my money and I'll decide whether or not they're being properly used!
That's got nothing to do with it!
It's good to see you. Sit down.
Flowers.
What do you mean, too bad?
Floor seats.
Speaking of which. I saw you talking to Ronnie this morning. Why can't you get it back together with her. You've gotta be out of your mind not to get with that one.
What's the line?
I've got to stop in there... Mr. Korda, do you know Frank Antonucci?
You fucking idiot! Why do you think I use you?... To be a walking advertisement.
Not the fucking cop that showed up at my door!
God damn it! I still needed to case that fucking store. It's too risky to show my face now.
Tell me what's wrong.
How can I help you with the particles?
They have less power over you if you look into my eyes.
Tell my dad.
I hate fucking Springfield.
Really?
That's right.
How about the record room for any incident reports? He might be a victim. We can get medical records. Check with burglary detail and see if anyone else knows him, knows his habits.
Recruited you from where?
You'd never been out of New York?
You're a real excitable sort, aren't you?
Come on. Let's go for a drink.
You got a girlfriend?
Yeah, I've got a girlfriend.
She's back in Jersey... going to graduate school.
No, no, no...  She's from Hoboken.
No. Actually I think it's fucking crazy, I don't know if I could do it.
You could say something like,  "Tell me what the scumbag's name is. Maybe we can work something out."
Yes.
What did you see?
Why did he do it?
To run last?
COME ON RUSSELL!...  Who the fuck's Russell?!
We won.
It might have happened no matter who was up there.
Is the hostage injured?
I can't guarantee you what it will be. But I swear on my life, I'll find you work.
You know what I think? I think you only want me now, because I'm with somebody else.
I won't stay long. I had to talk to someone.
It was my fault. I was right downstairs. I should have gone up with him.
You think I didn't need you?
I wanted to get this out of the way.
Scottie, remember the day you lost that hostage in union square. You came over that night and we made mad, crazy love. But I didn't even know what happened... 'til I heard it on the news the next morning.
When?
You like this place?
Why don't you come back up with me, Ronnie.
That's right. We've got to bare it all. Here and now. 'Cause I think I'm finally ready to go for it...
I'm talking about me 'n' you stripping down on this beach and gettin' you know... 'naked in Tahiti'.
What if you die and no one can do what you do as well as you do it?
Is there going to be an expression of your appreciation?
The financial kind. I figure I'm going to be working extra hours. All sorts of overtime... training sessions... Not to mention the extra stress...
The car is part of the deal.
The chief says to tell you how sorry he is. He knew Sam Baffert was a good man.
Roper...
What do we got?
Are these yours?
What do you need?
It's okay.
Why?
This is how you pick up women --
You were right.
You don't have much sex up there in the real world, do you?
It's all here...
Halden sent men to kill me in my sleep, but simple illusions won out.  So he now sends the legend to finish the deed.
God creates man, man creates technology, technology creates God.  End into beginning.
Dream?!
Unlimited energy out there.  Enough to run this world for all eternity --
Remember, I'm not the one who chose this.
Doesn't make sense.  How the hell does some fucking teenager get to the keys?
Because why the hell would you be interested in a program that allows people to live inside your machines?  I mean how much profit could there possibly be from owning the universe and selling space in it to people who are dying, or people who are just God-Damned sick of this world --
A hotel?
Christoph was a brilliant programmer, but very eccentric.  He insisted it be kept vacant.
Then you had her killed.
We drugged her.  So she wouldn't remember.
There was no need to kill her.
You went to my high-school?
That's why they told you you can't go inside.  They can't have you running into her.
But you were with me.
It was just there.
Don't know what you're talking about.
Connection approved.  Ready to transmit --
Access granted.  Male or female?
WE CAN'T BREAK FREE!
Ay, yi, yi, yi.  The legend speaks of a Master Warrior who lives on the planet Phaedos... This is the only person who knows the secrets of the power.
Is this... food!
In the language of the Nathadians, "Nin" stands for "man", "jetti" stands for "animal".  Ninjetti  - man and animal, together as one.  Now, put your hands inside the flame.
I can hardly walk...
Release the power with the power.
Anybody see anything?
To assist you I have retro-fitted your helmets with new Opti-Scan devices.
It is said that to those who possess the Power... all things are possible.
PTERODACTYL!
NINJA CRANE ZORD!
THREE DEGREES OFF THE COMETS TRAJECTORY!
... Not bad.
Let's go after him!!
I'm in!
IMPACT IN FIFTEEN SECONDS!
FOUR SECONDS TO IMPACT!
Be the eagle.  Be the eagle.
There goes the neighborhood.
And how do we do that?
... A falcon?
Hey, boss!
That's right.  And then we threw one of them off a mountain and another one into a raqing river!
Anybody see them?
I'm sorry, sir. Our clientele is restricted to White Anglo-Saxons.
You ever been near a meat packing plant? My father makes a couple million per, but the smell in his office is enough to make you puke.
I remember reading a poem in college. "Sicily. Poor, noble isle...".
Why should you be payin' me when we're all equals?
I ain't mad. I ain't even surprised. But I can't let ya fuck me. On the other hand, if ya got needs beyond the thirty-five, I'll advance it to you against our next deal on the same terms.
Their asses are here, but their fuckin' heads are still in Sicily.
They told me you wanted to talk about this Shane business.
Luciano.
Same here.
Why do you bother with perfume when you smell like this?
Charlie?
I'm gonna lose you, Charlie.
We need to put together a meet for the whole country. We all got the same problems. We could talk. Meet the guys we don't know. Lift a few with the guys we do.
Meyer, ain't anybody ever told you ya look more like a bookkeeper than a fuckin' mobster?
It's just that Maranzano's the only bastard I ever heard brag about gettin' audited by the IRS. He came out clean, so he thinks his shit don't stink.
Come off it, Bugs.
I like that.
Boss, I got all the time you need.
And what went on your little party in Atlantic City. I got ears.
If I wanted ta kill ya, I woulda done it long ago. It's not like you ain't given me reason.
So tell me when I ain't done it.
When ya got all that blood workin' in your belly, it ain't upstairs where it needs to be.
Not stupid. Fat.
Don Maranzano. Welcome.
Good liquor draws a good crowd.
And how many soldiers do you have?
The Internal Revenue came to my offices. I turned over all my ledgers. They found nothing. Charlie, I am a businessman.
Your Calabrian friend, I will accept. At least Costello eats pasta like us.
At first, it will hurt you. But you will come to understand and we will be strong together.
I will be the Boss of All Bosses.
Tell it to the Calabrian. Tell it to the Jews.
Forget it. That's past.
And if I had known, I would have warned you to expect this. We could have prepared.
Wanna know what I think?
Those fucks can't leave each other alone. Maranzano and Masseria ain't gonna be satisfied until one of 'em starts a war.
Where's the stiff?
You're fuckin' crazy.
Jesus, honey...he always joked about you <u>curing</u> him, but I never realized what you cured him <u>from</u>.
What's the maximum safe dose?
Dark Town. Land of nightmares. I'm Bull.
<i></i> I beg your pardon?
I was, uh, just getting ready to leave...
I'm not going to tell you that. I wanted that E- ticket. I wanted it so bad I'd stare <u>you</u> right in the face to get it - and I'd do the same again.
<i>De nada</i>. Now, come here...bend over...before I change my mind.
Hey. Where's Monkeybone?
Death! Thank you!
What's the matter?
Oh, here's something. The city zoo is kicking off a fund-raising campaign. They wonder if you'd be willing to appear at a benefit.
I can't believe you. You used to hate being the center of attention. Now you're proposing, in public, at a benefit.
The Nightmare Juice! It's gone! Somebody switched it for a beaker of grape Kool-Aid!!
Sorry, Steve, maybe next time. And how's our new guest settling in - ?
Oh, baby, I can't believe you're back.
What are you watching?
You sure this is...medically advisable?
Oh yeah. There's just one thing I don't get. "Monkeybone Creator Awakens from Coma" that's a big story! That's front page news! But I can't find a <u>word</u> of coverage in this stinkin' rag! <i></i> Hey. Don't I have a TV show?
It was you who got the standing O. It was you drawing on the belly over there...
Look at this! He won't let us leave!
I'm fine, baby. We're all okay. We were lucky.
Stu?
It's too soon even to - <u>talk</u> about that!
You're the only true-hearted man I ever met. You find a way back to that girl of yours and make her happy.
Go. Just <u>go</u>.
<u>You</u> have humiliated me in public for the <u>last</u> <u>time</u>.
Come on, pal! It was a compliment! You'da done the same if you had the equipment!
I'm reportin' this to my union!!
He's ninety. He's practically dead already. How come <u>he</u> goes back and <u>I</u> stay here?
I've been stuck down here for <u>months</u>. Somebody had better start paying attention, or I'm gonna - I'm gonna <u>kick ass</u>!
Fate worse than death! Well, it's been real, boss, but I gotta go buff up my resumé. ANYBODY HERE NEED A FIGMENT?
Stu...LOOK!
It's just...now that I'm leaving, I feel like there's lots of things I haven't said. Who's gonna look out for you? Are you gonna be okay when I'm gone?
Oh, please, don't hurt me.
Oh, let me get out of your way then.
Well, when I walked up the block, I ... well, my word!
How are you doing sweetheart?
Dating anyone?
Well, they were right out in plain view.
But I was dusting.
You know, you never tell me anything.
You know that guy in the pictures you saw?
You wouldn't be in the way.  I like having you around.
Really?
I came to New York to visit my youngest daughter.
This is one-way street.  You go down the block to the middle.
Calendar for the day. You'll find the Senate Manual in the drawer. Anything else you want, just snap for a page.
And you say you never signed this contract with Mr. Allen?
But it *isn't*?
You are saying, in effect, that this is a forgery?
Yes, sir--big as life. Been there some time now.
What's he bringing pigeons for?
Positively not in the station! Gone!
Sure. Sure. I'll hang a light in the steeple. One if by land--two if by sea!... Okay!  Diz--you won't believe it. Daniel Boone's *lost*!
How do you *like* this! You don't suppose that ranger met up with some kids--and took 'em for a hike!
No, not yet, Senator Paine--not hide nor hair of the man. You mean to say the boys haven't--?
Sit tight, Diz. The show commences in just a minute.
The Silver Knight. Soul of Honor--on a tight-rope.
Now, look, kid--if we're gonna wonder, let's go down and do it over a hunk of steak.  Come on, snap out of it. Diz Moore-- that rarest of companions--is here at your side.  To genteel crime, kid.
Drunks are funny--
Now, you've gone and let Don Quixote in here again. I told you to keep him out!
Diz--
You've never seen prairie grass with the wind leaning on it, have you, Diz?
No.
Nothing like--uh--Susan--or anything like that, huh?
Hey! We're gettin' married--!
Well--let's dig up the preacher, kid.
I knew it! I knew a night's rest wasn't possible in this house!  Hubert!
Yes, Joe, yes--right away.
Now, now, Emma, dear--you mustn't forget we have been chosen by the people of this commonwealth to--
Dinner, Hubert.
Emma, which is it--Horace Miller or Henry Hill?
He's batty!
--a *boy ranger* a squirrel chaser-- to the United States Senate!
What's the matter, Dad? Is it getting you down?
Gosh, Pop--head of the Boy Rangers!
I *thought* I heard... Yes?
That's easy. Jefferson Smith.
When Jeff gets through with Taylor, Pop--
Here they are--I got them. They are all right.
Where were you?
Mr. President!
I mean, sir--if I'm going to stay in the Senate--I ought to know what I'm doing--at least, I ought to try to study the Bills that are coming up--
I will, sir! I will!  I--I don't know how to thank you. I knew, if any man could help me--
I'm sorry! Gee! I hope--
Y-yes.
Yield *how*, sir?
Ah, now, that's better.
It does!
Mr. President--
I have no defense against forged papers and--
Yes, sir, I yield for a question.
Oh, now--
Certainly would, Joseph.
Well. I hear you've been right on your toes since you got here. Pitching right in. Lots of people took you for dumb--but they're wrong. You're smart. In fact, *I* think you're smart enough to understand a situation when it's explained to you--
What's your name?
Gosh--that'll be something! You know what I better do in the morning?
Go out to Mount Vernon. It'd be a sort of fine thing to do--see Washington's home just before walking into the Senate for the first time-- don't you think?
We're going right ahead with--*what*?
My dear Senator, have you the faintest idea of what it takes to get a Bill passed?
If I were *triplets*, I couldn't--. Look, Senator--let me give you a rough idea. A member has a Bill in mind--like you--a camp. Right?
A *day*!
Uh-huh. Well, dinner comes in on trays. We're executives. And we light into this. It is dawn. Your Bill is ready. You go over there and introduce it--
You get to your feet in the Senate and present it. Then you take the Bill and put it in a little box-- like a letter box--on the side of the rostrum. Just hold it between thumb and forefinger and drop it in. Clerks read it and refer it to the right committee--
That's how Congress--or any large body--is run. All work has to be done by committee.
Yes. They give it to a *sub*- committee, where they really give it a going over--hold hearings--call in people and ask questions--then report back to the bigger committee--where it's considered some more, changed, amended, or whatever. Days are going by, Senator. Days--weeks. Finally, they think it's quite a Bill. It goes over to the House of Representatives for debate and a vote. *But* it's got to wait its turn on the calendar--
Do you really think we're getting anywhere.
Pardon me--*this* is. Where are we now?
I did--and--and I got right up.
Well--gosh--that--that isn't "particulars," is it?
We need a lot like him--his kind of character--ideals.
Yes, yes--
You mean--here?
Have you always had to--work?
It hasn't been easy, has it?
But--I mean--for a woman--And--you've done awfully well--
Letitia.
Uh--Willet Creek. It's just a little stream--
You couldn't. You've never been out there, you said.
Well--no. I didn't. Why?
What do they--? Who are all those--?
Gee--I hope so. What's all this?
Good! I'm going to be pretty busy tonight--
Hello.
What you *have* to do is fight!
Jeff--listen--remember the day you got here?--what you said about Mr. Lincoln?--that he was sitting up there--watching--waiting for someone to come along? Well--that was *you*. Someone with a little plain, decent, uncompromising *rightness*--to root out the Taylors--yeah, and really light up that dome for once. This country could use some of that--so could the whole drunken, cockeyed world right now--a *lot* of it! And when the right man comes along--no matter *what* the odds--he can't *ever* quit! A little fellow called David walked out with only a sling- shot--but he had the *truth* on his side--
Tell us about yourself, Senator! Hear you got a Boy's Club back home! Any ideas? Going to make things hum in the Senate, huh?
Sure.
How--how do you do, Miss Paine?  I--I apologize for looking like this-- I--I have to be going now--
Well, goodbye, sir--and thank you again.  Well--it--it was nice seeing you, Miss Paine--
I--I'm awfully glad to be--that is, it was nice of you to--  Uh--how's your father?
It's just as well to tell you--because if we're going to get off on the right foot--I mean--in case I act sort of strange--it's the suit.
"I do solemnly swear--that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States--against all enemies, foreign and domestic--that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same--that I take this obligation freely--without and mental reservation and purpose of evasion-- and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God."
I said--I mean--Washington didn't live to see it finished. Congress didn't move here from Philadelphia till eighteen hundred.
Yes. Washington laid the cornerstone though--wearing an apron for the ceremony that was embroidered by Madame Lafayette--
I wouldn't wait if I were you.
H'ya, Carl--h'ya, Bill!
Chick--
Did I hear right? Did he say *Willet Creek*?
I know that.
Your Ranger's on the garbage pile, Happy! He's done for!
Well, when I first came to Washington, my eyes were big, blue question marks-- now they're big, green dollar marks--
What do you want, Senator?
What do you think?
You won't stand for it?
It's in your lap, Joe. Keep an eye on him. If he gets to his feet and says anything--
Anything *better* to offer?
Jim--the boy's talking to that State-- the story is out--!
Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?
Is there objection?  You may proceed, Senator.
Yeah, Mr. Cobb said stick to your tail no matter what.
That's going to be fun.
Good morning.
Most every day.
He walks in the rain, without his hat, and talks to himself.
For no reason, I guess. He always does it. We always run into the house when we see him coming.
Why, you've always been pixilated, Longfellow.
Are you married?
I don't mind though. I had a lot of fun doing it.
Thank you, Your Honor. Are you employed by the Morning Mail?
You are under oath, Miss Bennett. I ask you again - are you employed by the Morning Mail?
That's all, Miss Bennett.
You are , aren't you?
Oh, no, really - I'll be all right.
Feel better now?
What?
Sure. I met you.
Have you seen the papers?
To most people, it's an awful letdown.
I say, to most people it's a washout.
Oh, they just do it to sell the newspapers, you know.
You know, you said something to me when you first met me that I've thought about a great deal.
The drums. He taught me to play some.
All my life, I've wanted somebody to talk to. Back in Mandrake Falls, I always used to talk to a girl.
My unfailing instinct tells me something's gone wrong with the stew.
Uh-huh.
Huh?
You're acting like a school girl.
Oh, he's not getting away with anything.
Did it?
How'd you get the picture?
Marvelous!  "At two o'clock this morning, Mr. Deeds tied up traffic while he fed a bagful of doughnuts to a horse. When asked why he was doing it, he replied: 'I just wanted to see how many doughnuts this horse would eat before he'd ask for a cup of coffee.'"  Beautiful! What happened after that?
When're you going to see him again?
Good! Good!  Stay there. Don't show your face down here. I'll tell everybody you're on your vacation. They'll never know where the stories are coming from. Stick close to him, Babe - you can get an exclusive story out of him every day for a month. We'll have the other papers crazy.  Babe, I could kiss you!
Sure.
That's the rub.
It don't look as though we're gonna get any pictures tonight.
We've got nothing to worry about. He's as naive as a child.
don't want to be critical, John, but here it is
Will you show Mr. Hallor to the front door?
You try it.
He's not home, I tell you!
Nuisance value?
The Falkner sisters are rather timid, Your Honor, and wish to be together. If the court pleases, I will only have one of them testify.
Hang up.
Mr. Cedar is, and I haven't seen him in two days.  Listen, Cedar, we've got to do something about the newspapers.
Yeah. A glorified doormat.
Yes?
Mr. Longfellow Deeds?
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Are you a married man, Mr. Deeds?
Sit down. Sure I couldn't get you a glass of lemonade or something?
Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington.
Sounds like a two weeks' notice to me.
I've gotten the 'sackaroo' in many ways - but never in rhyme.
Have a drink?
Thanks  Oh, did you send that telegram to Jim Mason?
You'd better get right down there. That opera mob is about to break into the Mad Song from "Lucia."[2]
Your uncle had a weakness for dark ones, tall and stately. How would you like yours? Dark or fair, tall or short, fat or thin, tough or tender?
Arthur! Who's Arthur?
You shouldn't be running away like this. What's going to happen to the Estate?
I'm Chairman?
The wrong kind! There isn't any wrong or right kind. Opera is opera!
Well, we were rather expecting it to come from you.
Naturally.
You remember, Dr. Fosdick, in my last book there are some very fine examples.
Let him alone.
I leave it to you, Mr. Deeds. Can you conceive of any court not being in sympathy with any woman who gave up the best years of her life for an old man like your uncle?
Well, what about it, Mr. Deeds?
Sorry to keep you waiting so long. Those opera people are funny. They wanted me to put up $180,000.
Mrs. Semple is entitled to one- third of the estate.
Your Honor
Huh? On, no. Nobody important.
He's got a lot of foolish notions - about saving a lady in distress.
What is your name?
Tell me, Walter, are all those stories I hear about my uncle true?
I'd better call her up and apologize. I don't remember taking her home last night.
That's what the two policemen said, sir.
But she's on the telephone
Yes, sir. What is it, sir? Anything happened3
Mmmmfffstttubll abbittmm.
Oh, all the great writers -- Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Moby Dick... those people. Each is bound in genuine premium leather with 22 carat gold accents. It's a magnificent set -- and only $33.50 per volume. Right away you get Great Expectations for just $6.99.
It's irrelevant. It had nothing to do with what happened.
It's happened before.  I'm shocked by how little I'm feeling. I can't understand it.  I'll probably have a complete depressoid collapse soon, won't I?
That's it -- syndrome. So you know all about it?
Her friend from the city came and took her out to dinner. First time in a long time she's been willing.
But they're certainly dead. And yes, personally, I find it a bit odd.
What are you doing for lunch?
We're interested in any new therapies. How would you characterize your approach?
Why not?
What?
I was... never satisfied.
Let me just say something here... I have no idea if this is going to help.
-- and you told me that. Still, there's some kind of imagery that's haunting you and, I think, getting in your way --
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing? I want to know what's in here.
It's all right, it won't bite you. Under civil code 1294.67b you are entitled to be notified that your status and certification are being reviewed. This is the notice.
No thanks. Plenty of time for that when we're a little further along.
Are you a man who likes to treat himself right?
It means absolutely nothing to me that so many of your patients have come forward with praise for you and your therapeutic skills. You understand that?
I've seen you going by on your board, but I didn't realize -- you're so young... to be so...
It was Henry Follett.
Four months, two and a half weeks -- that's how long.  And you've already got more patients than those other two shrinks combined.
Do we run into the street? No, I didn't think so.  Nice car. How's that place?
Lily, I want you to meet Skip. Skip, Lily.
...so rich?
Here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing.
-- you crazy? You can't do this!
I'm a criminal lawyer -- you think I like my clients? I can't stand most of them! But I don't kick them out...
Hello, Lionel.
But you know how to drive?
I been drivin' since I was twelve.
Hello, Mother. I want you to meet Dr. Mumford.
Well... you see, the problem is --
Sofie. It's so obvious... you're after my daughter.
What can you tell me about this?
When did you start to feel this way?
What?
That's okay. Maybe it is. My mother always says -- "Everything that's wrong with you is in your head." I suppose that's true.
No... but it started one year to the day after my divorce became final. That's not too suspicious, is it?... But it wasn't like I was feeling bad about the divorce. Just the opposite.
I don't know. I barely made it today.
You have the best answer for everything.  You seem so... hopeful. Are you always this sunny?
Is it contagious? 'Cause everyone agrees my immune system's way down.
She's not in a bad mood. She's like that all the time.  It doesn't bother me anymore. It's my dad and my brother I worry about.
Is that the technical description of what I've got?
Please... forgive me.
Sore throat?
Yeah, most people have that. It's confusing here.
And he's where?
When I was in high school we used to come up here and make out. I liked to sit on the rock and watch the sun go down.
My brother said you were about to fire me.
Yes! And my ex-husband -- he never accepted me for who I was, just like Mother. The things you've said have helped me understand what a dick he is.
You're shockingly honest, that's what makes you great. I've never had a man treat me this way. With you, I feel really... listened to.  Can I tell you something? It's a little embarrassing, but I feel very unguarded with you.
I need to talk to you... Doctor. Can I come in?
Is it something you've heard about me?
First of all, I have been feeling much better lately. I don't know if the syndrome is over -- if it's just run its course or something -- but I feel a hundred per cent better than when I first came to you.
I guess you saw the show...?
Sofie...
I am irate!
But nothing... I'm mad as hell. This is a terrible thing you've done.
You got off easy.
Fuck the community.  There was this article my friends and I read. It was "25 Signs He's Great in Bed". It was very fascinating.
Where?... The New York Times. The first one was -- "he handles produce well." Which we already knew!  The point is, you have a lot of the signs.
I knew you wouldn't answer. I've been thinking about what you said last time. How me trying to lose weight -- and constantly not -- is like a lot of people with addictions. How maybe I can't lose the weight, ever...  Which we already knew...
Isn't she amazing? That is such a wicked look.
I don't know if I can quit. We're gonna try it together, like, you know, AA or something. And I made him give up his .22. No more sneaking around the hills with his fucking nut gun like some loony tune.
Can I ask you a personal question?
This is great!
Skip, you're the head of the whole deal here. Are they busier than you?
Well, there's Lily.
Slash what?
I've told you a lot of private stuff.
An IRS investigator with a drug problem?
Did you carry a gun?
But look at me now...
And the drugs?
I wish I could live in the shower. I'd take five a day if I had the time. I went to this spa in Germany, a sanitarium practically, up on this mountain. And the great thing -- they just kept you wet all day.
How'd you do it?  The new you.
Psych major?
Jeez, man. But you're good at it!
Where ya going? I've got a million questions.
Lily.
I'm here for you, Doc.
Doc!... It's not me, is it?
That was a terrible thing.
No mortal weapons can kill this creature. He is not of this world.
Who the hell are these guys?
And how does one do that?
Oh yes, of course.
If he arrives before us, it will be too late.
Altar boys?
What then? Robbery? Extortion? Kidnapping!
C'mon, friend.
The Prince does not like to be touched by other humans. A Silly eastern superstition, I'm afraid.
Then you got no excuse for living. What the hell you doin, being buddies with this creep, Beni? What's in it for you?
Immune from what?
The book! The black book they found at Hamunaptra! Imhotep wants it back. Said to me it would be worth it's weight in diamonds.
Yeah?
The key!? She has the lost key!?
I'm willin, to go on a little faith, here.
I wouldn't trade ya for a brass spittoon!
You bastards!
No women allowed.
Two hundred pounds.
Are you saying this filthy godless son of a pig knows where to find The City Of The Dead? Truly?
Do you realize, we are standing inside a room that no one has entered in over four thousand years.
We uh,... found... your puzzle box, and we've come to ask you about it.
How do you know the box pertains to Hamunaptra?
Yeah, I was there.
I don't believe in fairy tales and hokum, Mister O'Connell, but I do believe that one of the most famous books in history is buried out there, The Book Of The Living. It's what first interested me in Egypt as a child. It's why I came here, sort of a life's pursuit.
You know your history.
For what?
You two!
Unlike your brother, Miss, you I don't get. You're a whole new brew.
Something like that.
I'm not?
Is he supposed to look like that?
Yes, they never used it because they feared it so. It's written, that if a victim of the HOM-DAI should ever arise, he would bring with him the ten plagues of Egypt.
I'm staying.
Got it!
Oh yes I do! I have something right here!
You stole it from a drunk at the local Casbah?!
I can't believe I allowed the two of you to get me drunk.
Juicy?
I found it, Evy! I found it
Ummm, Hootash im... Hootash im now what is this last symbol here?
She's my sister, actually.
Sit down, O'Connell, sit down, we could use another good player.
I can't believe the price of these fleabags.
Tough break.
That looked rather painful.
Damn-it! That's two down and only two to go.
Do something, Jonathan! Kill it!
Everything's going exactly as we planned.
Where are you going?
You two timing psychotic bastard.
Come on, baby!
Atta, girl!
I'm her only son, and she always had such high hopes for me. Medicine. Law.
It's late. I'm headin' home.
Sounds good to me.
That's two more than the Fantastic Four.
Hey... you okay?
Superheroes.
Are you with me... or against me?
And the light goes out...
Are you an actress?
Come here.
I'd better go.
What?
Doesn't it piss you off the way the when you really want to talk to somebody you can't think of anything to say!
I admire you.
I've never been able to figure out what to do with my life, which is why I guess I'm still a waitress.
At the Frankenstein Center.
So, let me get this straight. You have the power to become invisible.
If someone looks at you, you immediately become visible again.
But now Casanova's back! And we're gonna sit around here all night eating pizza and telling stories! Hey, lets toast some marshmellows!
You drink too much.
Maybe. But this isn't about living or dying. It's about good versus evil, and we're good, whether we like it or not... Maybe we look a little funny...
Oh don't start that again --
I'm liking this.
Have you ever seen him?
You sure that's how you spell it?
This place is built like a fortress.
Cover me!
We need a break, that's all! Nobody'd ever heard of him until he busted Casanova Frankenstein!
What does it matter? Women just want to control you -- and talk about their feelings. They want to know why you're angry all the time -- and what can they can do to help -- so you tell them there's nothing -- nothing -- just leave me alone -- but they bug you and they bug you and they bug you -- until you just can't stand it anymore! -- so you finally open up -- you pop like a blister -- and it all comes spewing out -- all your emotions -- your feelings -- your fears -- all of it!  And then they dump you.
Or flowers.
I saw him go in -- and he didn't come out!
The who?
What's that?
Yes, Obie-wan.
You guys going to a costume party?
So what can I get you?
I use it... to fight evil.
It is?
It's time.
My dear Caulaincourt, agreements can endure only when they allow both sides to live.  Napoleon may believe it is necessary to injure England but, before that, he must realize it is necessary for him to allow his friends to live.  He cannot expect me to tell my nobles they must ruin themselves so that he can bring England to her knees -- and I'm afraid that is what it has come to.
Your Majesty knows my affection for him is deep and genuine, and goes far beyond my official role as Ambassador.  But I would be remiss in my feelings for you, and in my responsibility to the Emperor, if I did not say that it is entirely possible that the Emperor will view your refutation of the terms of the Treaty of Tilsit, as the first step in the exchange of a French alliance for an English one -- with all the dangers that might entail.
Your Majesty, I have been advised that you have received a letter from Napoleon, offering a peace treaty, and that you have decided to accept it.
The point I was trying to make is that I think it is reasonable to say that Your Majesty would not find himself under unbearable pressure, if he decided to make peace with the Emperor, at least at this time.
Forgive me, Your Majesty, I am about to make it.
Well, that is a very interesting idea, General Kutusov, but I can assure you that Napoleon is no beginner at this.  Whatever analysis you have done on this situation, I am sure that he has gone over the same ground.
Well, one thing immediately comes to mind, if what you are saying is true -- he would merely withdraw his army from Moscow and return to Poland for the winter.
Yes, Captain?  Have you anything you wish to say?
Please...
We expect an attack on the Convention tomorrow morning, at daybreak, and I have been placed in charge of its defense.
I don't even know whether a defense is possible.
Well, I believe there are at least 30 guns at Sablons.
Would you be prepared to handle this for me?
But did she have the best doctors? Wasn't there any chance at all to save her?
She should have had Larrey or Corvisart.  They might have saved her... But why didn't anyone even write to me?  Can you believe that no one even bothered to write to me? Would you have believed that I should read such news in a newspaper?  How incredible!
Who is there?
Read it back.
General Bonaparte?
This dispatch has just arrived from Aboukir, marked highest priority, for General Bonaparte's eyes only.
Captain Charles, I believe you are one of General Le Clerc's aides-de- camp.
Then, you have my thanks, Captain Charles, for safely escorting Madame Bonaparte to Milan, and you may consider your assignment completed.
When did it start?
I beg your indulgence, Ambassador, but it is.
I have met her.  What is your business with me?
A sword is a weapon whatever else you might wish to use it for.
Well, then, you have a lot of initiative, my young friend.
Will Alexander be joining us soon?
You must be chilled to the bone, standing out of doors like this.
Oh, I see... That must be a great burden.
Well, it must be a good deal warmer than it is here on the street.
That's a very nice name.  Where are you from?
I would like both of you to read this.  Please read it aloud.
No -- Captain Charles commanded the cavalry escort, and rode outside the carriage.  In the evenings, he always ate at another table.  They hardly ever spoke to each other.
The comedy of my marriage is sufficiently well known already.
It is time to clarify the situation. Everything is over between us.
She will probably appear with a dozen excuses and you will forgive her anyway.
Oh... yes, of course!  Have you met my daughter, Hortense?
May I offer you a drink?
Oh, it's not the slightest inconvenience, General Bonaparte. It is an honor to have you here.
But you have had mistresses while you were away.
Yes -- what is it?
Go away -- I'm busy.
I will be there in five minutes.  Go back to your guests.
Who is it?
That's all I can say.
You wrote it.
What was there to tell?
You could hear them?
Are you trying to provoke me, monsieur?
May I inform you, monsieur, that I am Major Fidon, official courier to the court of the Emperor Napoleon, on my way to our Embassy at St. Petersburg and, in accordance with the rules of the road, no one may overtake or pass me.
Will I be able to play the harp?  It is an instrument of which I am very fond.
You are so good to me.  Will you also allow me to have a botanical garden?
Will it be possible to have my dog, Bijou, sent here?  I was not allowed to bring her and I love her so much.
Do you know the joke about the two Swiss boys who go to a bordello for the first time?
What I am talking about is moderation.
Is he alone?
Napoleon was born at Ajaccio in Corsica on August 15th, 1769.  He had not been a healthy baby and his mother, Letizia, lavished him with care and devotion.  In middle age, he would write about her from St. Helena.
His moods at this time were complex and varied.
Napoleon would soon arouse the resentment of the Directory in Paris, exceeding his authority, making political decisions and treaties like a Roman Conqueror, enlarging his role to ruler of Italy.  Only his tremendous success and ever increasing popularity prevented the Directory from replacing him.
On December 2, 1804, Napoleon was made Emperor of France.  He would later say:  "I found the crown lying in the gutter and I picked it up."
Led by the warlike Queen Louisa, and her fashion-minded husband, King Frederich Wilhelm, the Prussians still believed themselves cast in the mold of Frederick the Great, and more than a match for Napoleon.  The King had a special collection of 60 splendid uniforms, and was personally involved in the design of all the Prussian army uniforms.
Send Betty my love.  Boy you looking good.  I'mma take these in the house for you, man... and when you finish with this cat, come inside.  I got something to show you.
Man, that girl's gonna kill me one day. Viagra ain't working.  My back keep going out... she don't never get enough.  But check this out.  I got to lay some ground rules.  Your my family and I love you.  You're welcome to anything you want in my home. But I don't wanna catch you in the refrigerator or in my Suga bowl... you feel me knocking?
That's okay, Unc.  I can't swim, either.
I know you smoke weed, right?
Who are you?
Great moves, Day-Day.
For sure.  That's how I like 'em.
Naw, I already ate.
It's about to work, just come on.
Fuck, what's his name?
What's crackin'?
Yep.  I forgot about him cussin' out everybody.  Damn that was fun.
They ever let you hit the switches on that Cadillac?
Must be nice.  I wish we won the lottery. Come up on a million dollars like ya'll.
Pinky's Records and Disc in the shopping center.  I'mma talk to my boss and see if he got a little position for you.  'Cause you been unemployed for a long time now, Craig.
What's the matter with your girlfriend?
Damn, you got a stalker.
Why?
Blow.
You see that?
Wait.
To the Cucamonga shopping center.
You want us to give you a ride?
Hello, remember me?
Most definitely.
Huh?
I did.  Is that door locked?
I got my cousin Day-Day waiting for me.
Here I come!
What it smell like?
Nice neighborhood, huh?
Yeah, I'm 'bout it.
I can't get jiggy with this shit.  Where is the damn manager?
Did you see that?  That was a W.W.F. hit right there, huh, Day-Day?
What was that?
I do.
I don't know.  I hope Craig got a good idea.  We gotta ask him when he comes out.  Let's go and clean up before Pinky gets here.
Roach...Roach, come on.
You wanna knock?
Look, man, this is a big misunderstanding.  All we wanted to do is borrow some sugar.
Hey, guys, I'm outta here.
Shut up!  Both of you right now!
Where did Craig move to?
What you say?
Debo!  Debo!
We must be here 'cause we stopped.
Hey, how you get out of here.
When?  After you get all drunk and loaded?
Need to lose some weight.
Damn, big bro.  You swung that like Sammy Sosa.
Elroy, what happen?
Don't remind me.
Truth is, besides the headache I've come down with a little lower intestinal havoc. Make my apologies.
All right, I'll do it.
Where'd you come from?
Look...I've... I've got a problem. A big problem...
Mrs. Grant, Governor...I won't hurt you.
I appreciate that.
Hey! I'll take the girl. I'll take the girl!
You're out of your mind.
I will do no such thing.
Look at your watch. Look at it! At one-thirty your little girl is dead. Say it with me. At one-thirty my little girl is dead. Say it. Say it!
This says "invitation only".
You get another chance in ten minutes.
I don't know.
The man following me has a walkie- talkie. If he sees I'm not here he'll call his partner. I do anything out of line and he'll send the word to kill my daughter.
But...
Now, see, this is why you should always wear a helmet and knee pads. You never know when you're going to fall down and go boom. Right?
He has to say "over and out". Daddy, you have to say "over and out".
Yes, sweetie, it's me.
No. Kisses to you.
Can I get out to Flower Street from here?
Who?
Meet Irene.
You're going to go see her.
What am I supposed to say to her?
You just think you don't want your windshield cleaned.
For the last time, I don't want it cleaned. Now get the hell out of here!
I don't have to pay you nothin'.
Hey!
He got onto the pool deck with a gun. How did he get past her Security carrying a
You stole that.
Hey, would you look at this crazy car? Everybody has their own radio. What do you think of that?
He's going to help the police. Your daddy is going to be a hero.
I'm not a baby.
It's under control.
Where is he? Did you lose him?
Get moving.
Skate-boarders I don't mind, even though they dress like fuckin' idiots, but when I see some pin-head on rollerblades, I get the definite urge to grease the grill of my car with 'em.
Look at 'em. He'd do anything for her.-
Come Back.
He never told about the money.
Ben, I'm a Man of God.
The religion the Almighty and me worked out betwixt us.
You understand?
She don't put in at Cresap's Landing no more, but she still blows as she passes. Come on in and have a cup of coffee.
'Twas down at Cresap's Landing, Along the River Shore, Birdie Steptoe was a Pilot in the good old days of yore. Now he sets in his old wharf-boat...
Yes! Yes!
It's a mighty good man would come out of his way to bring a word of cheer to a grieving widow!
Now, Mother, a body can't help their feelin's.
Is he hit pretty bad?
Lynch him! Lynch him!
He lied!
If ever I saw a Sign from Heaven!
What he needs is a dose o' salts!
That boy's as stubborn and mulish as a sheep!
My dear, dear friends! Whatever would I do without you!
I burned it.  I tore it up and burned it -- it stank so strong of hellfire.
Now can I tell?
You swore, Pearl!
Pearl! You ain't --
I'm hungry, John.
John?
Why, he told me what fine little lambs you and your sister both was.
-- and when we come back, we'll all be friends -- and share our fortunes together, John!
What's that you're playing with, boy?
She thinks that money's in the river, but you and me, we know better, don't we, boy?
All right boy: where's the money?
Now it's your turn.
You're just foolin'! My name's Pearl.
Yes; John's bad.
Why, pray tell?
That's mighty brave of you, Reverend.
John: take that look offen your face and act nice.
John, Mr. Powell has got something to tell you.
Harry!
It's the business of our marriage to mind those two you have now -- not to beget more.
You're Miz Cooper, I take it.
Them kids is yours?
Miz Cooper!
Nightmares are expected after psychological trauma. Don't worry, they go away.
You okay?
Okay?
Yeah. So?
They got a whole system they call 'dream skills'. So, if you have a nightmare, for instance like falling, right?
Much better.
What!?
Decide to take a day off after all?
He's dangerous.
Sure, okay, I'll be there. Now you just turn in and get some rest, sweetheart. Please. Deal?
DAD! GET US OUTTA HERE!
What's the Coroner got to say?
Tell her I'm not here, tell her...
Did you sleep?
Take this, it'll help you sleep.
Go even crazier?
The cops were all over my house.  They'll kill me for sure.
I never touched her.
Do you think I did it?
Thank you, Comrade.
Well, here are fifty francs.
I know... my heart is sad... but my feet are happy. When all the tanks and guns were roaring over the Red Square I sat here all by myself and played a Beethoven sonata. Not bad at all.  Are you expecting someone?
Ever since you have been back from Paris...
When you get up you put on a negligee, and then you change to a morning frock.
Comrades! Comrades! Don't let's give in so quickly. After all we have to uphold the prestige of Russia.
You wouldn't like Razinin.
Are we free, Buljanoff?
That's her.
You must help us, Leon... if you don't win her over we're on our way to Siberia!
Imagine, for once in our lives we were in Paris and we never went to the Eiffel Tower.
It is, Ninotchka! It is! He must have been in Paris! You can see it in his whole attitude! He just picked up a crumb of our black bread, shook his head, and dropped it.
Let's fill it with confitures, des prunes...
And the surprise is there's nothing in it.
We are not comrades any more... we are friends, Ninotchka.
Misha! Misha!
That must be the one!
You know what they say -- there's nothing like home.
We can say whatever we want. We can shout... we can complain... Look...  The service in this hotel is terrible!  See? Nobody comes... nobody pays any attention. That's freedom.
I am Comrade Buljanoff.
May I ask how much your rooms are?
This is the apartment we have reserved for you, Comrade Yakushova. I hope you like it.
There's something else which I know will appeal to you. A visit to the Paris sewers. They tell me it is extremely instructive.
Comrades... I'm out of the omelet.
Boys, boys... don't forget Russia is your mother country. Three sons walking out all at once... that's too much for any mother.
Count d'Algout is still asleep.
Count d'Algout, there have been several telephone...
I can't follow you, Gaston, isn't it about time that you realized the unfairness of your position? You being my servant? Wouldn't you like to stand on an equal footing with me?
Isn't there any revolt in you? Sometimes when I order you around don't you feel like kicking me in the pants?
You're looking magnificent, Leon...  ...isn't he, General Savitzky?
You know, Monsieur Mercier, this is all non-sense.
That won't help you! You can't intimidate us!
We don't blame you, Leon, but when we came from Russia we believed in simplicity...
We don't want to be disturbed.
I suppose you expect us to hand over the jewels?
How does this strike you? Commissar Razinin, Board of Trade, Moscow. Unexpected situation here. Duchess Swana in Paris claims jewels, and has already brought injunction against sale or removal. After long and careful study we suggest in the interest of our beloved country a fifty-fifty settlement as best solution. Iranoff, Buljanoff, and Kopalski.
Well, boys, I'd like to help you but what can I do? Yesterday I waited six hours in the lobby!
If we had known we would have greeted you with flowers.
If there is anything we can do for you...
Yes, there's no doubt of that...  Just look out of the window and there it is.
I'm sorry, gentlemen. The other day I heard such a funny story...  It still makes me laugh. It is very funny.  I am sorry. Oh yes... about this injunction...
We'll leave these papers here for your further consideration. Au revoir, madame.
What for... why?
You, please.
At what intervals does he whistle?
Technical... I couldn't help you from that angle. You see, a real Parisian only goes to the top of the tower in moments of despair to jump off.
Suppress it.
I have heard of the arrogant male in capitalistic society. It is having a superior earning power that makes you like that.
Then why don't we go?  You might be an interesting subject of study.
Is this what you call the "butler"?
Is that customary?
And what do you do for mankind?
That is correct.
Your general appearance is not distasteful.
Look at me. The whites of your eyes are clear. Your cornea is excellent.
I acknowledge the existence of a natural impulse common to all.
I can't possibly think of a better reason.
I must go.
It is out of the question. If you wish to approach me...
Room service speaking.
Pardon me for addressing you but you insulted him, you know that. You hurt his feelings. It was just like telling a musician you don't like music. That good old man believes in food as you believe in Karl Marx. You can't go around hurting people, Comrade Yakushova, but maybe you can make it up to him. Do you know how?  By eating everything with relish, by drinking everything with gusto, by having a good time for the first time in your natural life!
Oh, Ninotchka, who wants to talk business. If you win the suit, fine. If we win the suit, better. You do me an injustice.  When we went to my apartment did I have the slightest idea that you had any connection with this deal?
Death! Death! Always so glum! What about life, Ninotchka! Do Russians never think of life? Of the moment in which we are living? The only moment we really have? Don't take it all so seriously, Ninotchka. Nothing is worth it. Please... relax... I beg you, Sergeant... smile!
Will you smile?
I suppose you don't think that's funny?
No... go on.
If you don't want to answer, you needn't. But if you do, you must tell me the truth.
I suppose she is very entertaining... It must be lots of fun to be with her, so witty, so glamorous...
Leon, don't ever ask me for a picture of myself... I couldn't bear the thought of being shut up in a drawer... I couldn't breathe, I couldn't stand it.
I wouldn't know. The closest I ever came to champagne was in a newsreel. The wife of some president was throwing it at a battleship.
From what I read I thought champagne was a strong drink. It's very delicate. Do people ever get drunk on this?
How do you do?
Go on.
Wonderful -- if one could believe it.
Oh, everything is so wonderful! It's getting farther and farther away!
I must talk to my brothers!
But, darling, you can't do that.
No, don't let's have it any color... no color... just a house house... let's form our own party.
I have paid the penalty. Now let's have some music.
Radio! What is radio?
What shall we get? The news!
Yes, sweetheart... all by ourselves.
Comrades! People of the world! The revolution is on the march... I know... wars will wash over us... bombs will fall... all civilization will crumble... but not yet, please... wait, wait... what's the hurry?  Let us be happy... give us our moment....  We are happy, aren't we, Leon?
But, Leon, I am only here for a few days.
Did you win?
My little Volga boatman! Stop threatening! I don't deserve this.  Are you my little Volga boatman?
Did I hear something about jewels?
Is anything wrong? Are you ill?
Make it ice cold.
You just told me you hadn't seen her.
You saw all that in one glimpse?
Yes, Swana, you did.
I've some wonderful news for you, Leon. It's about Punchy... do you mind if I sit down?
Now, please, Swana.
Not at all.... I understand perfectly, Count d'Algout gave you a dog. You made it very clear, madame.
I wouldn't waken Leon. After last night I would say not before three o'clock at the earliest.
Where are they?
Now, let's free ourselves from emotionalism and try to solve the problem in a practical way. Our situation has changed considerably. Before I had only a claim to the jewels. Now I have the jewels.
Well... that's my business, madame.
Does this include the products of the Far Eastern provinces?
Oh, they shouldn't do such things. Are you sure this report is correct?
I am sorry, I don't want to overstep my position -- but please... don't send me.
At Père Mathieu's.
It's just a place for workmen.
No, madame, something of the utmost importance... it concerns your jewels.
I remember one birthday of His Majesty, our beloved Czar... I had the honor of being on guard at the summer palace... I still see you bending before His Majesty... You wore your diadem and a necklace... your face seemed to be lighted by the jewels.
Sir, the charges are serious -- first, abuse of power; second, obstruction of justice; third, failure to cooperate with Congress; and last, bombing Cambodia ...
Sir, if I may ... echo my concern ...
You're lawyers.  How can you let this shit go by!  Look!  This?  Nixon can't say this.
We could check the tape again, sir.
Executive clemency ...
He's right.  Maybe it's time to go to the hang-out route, John.  A full and thorough investigation ... We've cooperated with the FBI, we'll cooperate with the Senate.  What do we have to hide?
Is it?
Why me?
I think he means the Kennedy assassination.
Martha's an idiot, she'll do anything to get John's attention.  If Mitchell'd been minding the store instead of that nut Martha we wouldn't have that kid Magruder runnin' some third-rate burglary!  Was he smoking pot?
This is not a joke, John!
Why not?
He's in the dumps, sir.  Agnew.  Every time you have him attack the press, they give it back to him in spades. He's become the most hated man in America.
What about England?
It'll never wash.  Pardoning them means we're guilty.  The people, the press will go nuts.
This is June twentieth?
Let 'em try!  I appointed three of those bastards!  I'm not giving 'em my tapes!
"Victory at Sea," Al ... Henry.  The Pacific Theatre.  Christ, you can almost feel the waves breaking over the decks.
The army?
Sir, you talked about opening up the whole "Bay of Pigs" thing again.
... they smelled the blood on me this time, Al.  I got soft.  You know ... that rusty, metallic smell ...
On the list of horribles, I know what he is.  And I know what he tracks back to.  You say he was involved in the Plumbers?
Fucking hell.
Uh, no one, of course, is going to see these tapes, but ...
This isn't a "moral" issue, Bob.  We have to keep our enemies at bay or our whole program is gonna go down the tubes.  The FBI is filled with people who are pissed that I put Gray in and not one of their own.  Vietnam, China, the Soviet Union: when you look at the big picture, Bob, you'll see we're doing a hell of a lotta good in this world.  Let's not screw it up with some shit-ass, third-rate burglary.
No, no, not tonight.  Don't let her in here.  I have too much to do.
... When we consider the lineup of the world, we find there are 590 million people on our side, 800 million on the Communist side, and 600 million who are neutral.  The odds are 5 to 3 against us ...
Cue the crowd.  Go to the woman's group.  Get the bald guy, he's great ...
He wasn't protecting me.  He was putting me on notice.
... never complain, never explain, John ...
... and we've got the economic guys at five.  The Dow lost another 16 points. They're going to want a decision on the budget.  Sir?  ... Are we holding the line on a balanced budget?
Get that little fucker!  Great tackle! Reminds me of my days at Whittier. Most of these kids are useless.
Mr. President!
We really must go, Mr. President.
She got it, Bob.  A nineteen-year-old college kid ...
Because Harold tests thy father's will is no reason to admire him.  Let Harold's worldliness be a warning to thee, not an example.
It's meant to make us stronger.  Thou art stronger than Harold ... stronger than Arthur.  God has chosen thee to survive ...
I'm honored, Dick, that you've come all this way out here to Virginia to visit us at last.
Of course we've tried, but so far we've come up with nothing that ...
I'm sure you realize this is a very tricky area, Mr. President, given our charter and the congressional oversight committees ...
You're referring, of course, to chairing the Special Operations Group as Vice President.
Are you tapping Kissinger?
Not if you have spies in the White House, it isn't your job.
I never thought Jack was ready for the presidency.  But I would never, never consider ...  His death was awful, an awful thing for this country.  Do you ever think of death, Mr. Helms?
What do you think this plan is, Edgar? A nuclear attack?
I want to see him tomorrow, Clyde.
... little Bobby.
My father built the house where I was born with his own hands.  Oh, it wasn't a big house ...
Roselli?  Johnny Roselli?
I never met the man.
You'll win the nomination.
The little bastards think they can ruin Tricia's wedding day by dancing naked in the Reflecting Pond.
We can't keep a goddamn secret in this government, Edgar.  They're stealing papers right out of his office.
We took his system out.
Who do you think is behind it?
Kissinger?
Yeah, you do.  I'd be bugging myself, Edgar ... Who'd get the tapes?
Why, you got a customer?
Where'd you find him?
Personally I'd prefer a greyhound with a shot of speed.
Hell, Kennedy's pissed Cuba away to the Russians.  And he don't know what the hell he's doing in Vietnam.  These are dangerous times, Dick, especially for business ...
... And now I have a federal judge ordering me to bus my kids halfway 'cross town to go to school with some nigger kids. I think, Mr. President, you're forgetting who put you where you are.
It's your people who are leaking to the Times.  Wasn't this Ellsberg a student of yours at Harvard?  He was your idea; why are you suddenly running for cover?
Churchill, DeGaulle, Disraeli.  They all went through the pain of losing power.
Well, as you know, most of my staff have weighed in against this "incursion."  They believe it will fail to achieve anything fundamental militarily, and will result in crushing criticism domestically ...
Exactly, sir.  That is your historical contribution: to lead boldly in an era of limits.
All kinds of shit would come out. Like the Ellsberg thing.  You knew about that, Henry, didn't you?
That doesn't matter now, Henry.  The point is, you might lose some of your media-darling halo if the press starts sniffing around our dirty laundry.
If they harass you, I, too, will resign.  And I will tell the world why.
But your writings have changed the world, Mr. Chairman.
I was asleep, Mr. President.  What can I get you?
We let you down, didn't we.  Your people.
He was a politician.
Don't ever trust them.  They never tell the truth or honor their commitments.  Vietnamese are like Russians.  Both are dogs.
Yes, well ... Gentlemen, I promised my wife.  I'm out of politics.
And Dick beat the shit out of them.
It's a thing she does.  She talks at night.
This isn't '48, Dick.  They'll never buy it.
It wasn't your fault.  The soldiers were just kids, too.  They panicked.
But it was all we had.
Where you from?
What you have to understand, Mr. Nixon, is that we are willing to die for what we believe in.
Yeah, she lives in Dallas ...
We didn't come here to talk about football.  We came here to end the war.
We lost ...
It makes us human ...
I'll concede in the morning.
Everything's political, for Christ's sake!  I'm political.  And you're political, too!
This is just what they want, Buddy. Don't you see it?  They want to drive us apart.  To beat us.  We can't let them do it.  We've been through too much together, Buddy ... We belong together.
Yeah ... I'm out.
Are you okay?
I do.  I do.  In my own way.
Yes!
Congratulations, Dick.
Tomorrow.
Won or lost?
Some say you are, Rocky.
Hey, you know Henry Kissinger -- he's down from Harvard.  On my staff, foreign policy whiz ...
How you been, Ellis?
...What you got ain't nothin' new. This country is hard on people. Hard and crazy. Got the devil in it yet folks never seem to hold it to account.
I thought maybe she was with your boy there.
All that at the Eagle Hotel. It's beyond everything.
Don't know why I did. I told you, I don't know where he is.
No I ain't.
Yes ma'am?
...You ride Winston.
These boys is all swole up. So this was earlier: gettin set to trade. Then, whoa, differences... You know: might not of even been no money.
We goin' in?
Sheriff, that's aggravating.
What was the bullet?
Yessir. None of the three had ID on 'em but they're tellin' me all three is Mexicans. Was Mexicans.
Yessir.
...This month's checks.
...Could I get you to call Loretta and tell her I've gone to Odessa? goin' to visit with Carla Jean Moss.
What do you think.
I put it in, Mama.
No.
...You got no cause to hurt me.
Did you buy that gun?
Llewelyn!
What'd you give for that thing?
I need to know that.
What're you doin', baby?
Odessa.
Not we, you. Stay with your mother.
Llewelyn --
Why all the way to Del Rio?
Promise?
You are comin back, ain't ya?
What should I do?
Llewelyn, I ain't gonna leave you in the lurch.
Find who? What am I supposed to do with Mother?
Yessir?
Hello?
...Where's the transponder?
What airport would you use.
I don't know.
You know how this is going to turn out, don't you?
He gave Acosta's people a receiver.
Now. We close now.
You don't know what you're talking about, do you?
Why would you be comin' back? We'll be closed.
...If that's the way you wanna put it.
...Don't put it in your pocket.
I'm waitin' to hear your description of that.
It's all right.
Okay.
What about one forty-two.
Half.
...Don't worry. I'm not the man that's after you.
It's called a transponder.
Cast iron?
Were you in Nam?
Don't jack with me.
Nam?
Could I have that in American?
Sorry you had to see that. You were saying?
Hey, Sheriff. How's everything?
Sheriff, I don't...
Ahh, what'd you do now... fall off your bike again?
Good God... they're meat eaters, Roy, just drop the shit in there!
I questioned Joyce about all this...
Oh, you're sharp as a tack, Elden.
I see you're sticking to the diet Betty put you on...
Yeah? Well, she called Sue Ann yesterday from Arizona.
That's a lie! I figured it out! I've been trying to tell this dumbass --
We're in a shootout, Roy! Shut up about the damn fish!
We need ammo... Go check his jacket, I'll cover you.
You wanna see if he has more shells, go ahead. I say we wait...
Who are these idiots?
So you weren't involved with him in his pathetic attempt to diversify?  Were you mixed up in the drugs, Betty?
...well, if you're not going to slit my throat, why'd you come up here?
I'm appreciably older than you, but my health is good. I take care of myself, and I got some money socked away. You'd never have to work again, that's for sure. I'd treat you like a queen.
Well, thirty-three, but I'm not counting Del, on account of you... so, what do you think?  You probably feel I'm flattering myself to see us together.
I wrote that when I was twelve... where'd you get that?!
Wait, Betty... you still haven't answered me.
Did... did you really come here because you love this guy?
Aahhh...  So what color is it?
Let me know if you need anything, okay?
All you been through... I ever tell you what a good friend you are?
Betty, honey, listen to me. A man came by from Mutual Life Insurance. He says you've got money comin' to you from Del's policy.  Del's life insurance policy -- Are you with me?
That's very kind of you.
Oh my God! What's Lonnie doing here?
Carleton School of Nursing. Two semesters, but Del made me give it up...
Of course.
Your lines are in the script, but you can ad lib.
I'm sorry... Oh my gosh, are you George McCord?!
Oh. Of course... sorry.
I have... did it sound that bad?
So, call me when you --
I don't need one, but it's kind of a special night, and --
...well, then you ain't got much.
Oh, that... Sure, I saw the whole thing. It was disgusting!
I left my husband two days ago.
How did you know?
Dr. David Ravell.
ARE YOU CRAZY?!! STOP IT!!!
You don't sound like you're from here.
It's something I had to do. For David.
You can go get your stuff right now. I'll walk you down.
I know what you mean, I recently had some trouble with a man, a different man... and David's still getting over Leslie.  His wife.
It may not have been an accident. They never did find her head...
...so, we'll hit the library first and fan out from there. They've got all the L.A. phone books, plus medical directories...  We're not gonna let him hide from you any more, okay? I'm making this my personal mission.
I spent my weekend looking for someone who does -- not -- exist. I should have been here at the hospital with my brother, but I was with you.
Why'd you help me in the first place?
I'm not going back on our arrangement. My word is good, and my family owes you. But I think it's best for both of us if you get your own place as soon as you can.
Were you with him this whole time?
Really. And where was that, old man?
Could you give us an example?
You did not just say "Injuns," Del.
No, that's ignorant. They just don't know any better.
This is great -- just great! Now we don't know where the goddamn stuff is.
He's telling the truth. He doesn't know.
So how do we know that car's still in Fair Oaks?
Oh, for Chrissakes. It just means the kind of person who can eat shit for a long time without complaining, then cut their momma's throat and go dancing the same night.
Wise beyond her years, I'm sure, and such poise, too.  Very, very impressive...
And then we're gonna do her right here. Right?
Okay, thank you, goodbye... Keep in touch...
That was a really shitty thing to do.
It's a very moving experience, trust me.
One of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World.
What difference does it make? She wasn't in Kansas City, or Houston, or Dallas. We went to every goddamn place Del mentioned and no Betty. So what the hell makes you think she's in Vegas? You think she's waiting for us with tassles on her titties? Vegas is too crass for Betty.
"When I grow up I'm going to become a nurse or a veterinarian. I always want to help people and value all life, be it animal, plant or mineral..."  Does that sound like a goddamn showgirl to you?
This doesn't look like the kind of place Betty would go to.
That's good. You're learning. But let me tell you why I know she was lying.  First off, Betty would never fall for a soap star. It's beneath her.
You need to remember who you're talking to...
I said 'got it?'
No... if we don't finish this job, how are we gonna look at ourselves in the mirror? This is it for me, Wesley, she's the last one. My instinct says I gotta see this through with her, and if there's one thing I've tried to teach you here --
This is Betty at twelve.
What'd you get her?
Isn't that the point?
Alright, I admit it, you had me there. You're better than most of them, anyway... do you have a headshot?
I'll tell the cast ahead of time. What do you say?
Let me try this, goddamnit! SHE'S BEEN DOING IT ALL WEEK, SHE CAN DO IT NOW!
Hey... Is Betty still trying to find that soap opera guy?
Did Chloe crack?
I flatter myself that such is the case; in my line of work it's plumb necessary. The one thing you don't want is air in the conversation.
Thankee boys for throwin' in that fricasee. I'm a man a large appetite and even with lunch under my belt I was feeling a mite peckish.
End of the road, boys. It's had its twists and turns -
'N I'm Delmar O'Donnell.
You got light fingers, Everett. Gopher?
Why don't we bed down out here tonight?
We didn't abandon you, Pete, we just thought you was a toad.
How'd he know about the treasure?
This ain't no laughin' matter, Everett.
Five... hunnert... thousand... each.
Damn! We gotta skedaddle!
Yeah, look at me.
Deceitful! Two-faced! She-Woman! Never trust a female, Delmar! Remember that one simple precept and your time with me will not have been ill spent!
So - where's all the money from your armored-car job?
Huh. I guess they'll tack on fifty years for me too.
We'll go fetch it with ya, Everett.
A miracle! It was a miracle!
We ain't one-at-a-timin' here, we mass communicatin'!
Vernon Waldrip.
That ain't your daddy, Alvinelle. Your daddy was hit by a train.
I can and I am and I will - tomorrow! I gotta think about the little Wharvey gals! They look to me for answers! Vernon can s'port 'em and buy 'em lessons on the clarinet! The only good thing you ever did for the gals was get his by that train!
Pete's cousin turned us in for the bounty!
YOU LOUSY YELLA-BELLIED LOW-DOWN SKUNKS-
How's this a plan? How're we gonna get a car?
To Washington Bartholomew Hogwallop. From his loving Cora. Ay-More Fie- dellis.
Well, I'll be a sonofabitch. Delmar's been saved!
Itta Bena, now, uh, that would be...
But...
...No treasure... I had two weeks left on my sentence...
Pete... I do apologize.
Who's the honcho around here?
Well sir, my name is Jordan Rivers and these here are the Soggy Bottom Boys outta Cottonelia Mississippi- Songs of Salvation to Salve the Soul. We hear you pay good money to sing into a can.
...Yeah?
This is it. This is where I live. I suppose you could bunk over there and you could go to school at the base.
Why?
Hey, what did you want? A lot of fatherly bullshit? A big pat on the back?
She said you told her in every letter how much you loved her, how you wanted to marry her, have children with her...
Good morning, girls.
Joe!
How did you slip into this program, Mayo? I didn't know the Navy was so hard up.  You got an injury there, Mayo?
Stop eyeballing me, mister! I've looked through your file and done a little checking, and I know it all. I know about your mother. I know your old man's an alcoholic and a whore chaser.  Life sure has dealt you some shitty cards! Hasn't it, Mayo?
I don't want to do something anybody can do.
That's not true, sir! I've changed a lot since I've been here! And I'm gonna make it, sir!
Mayo, you didn't hear me -- I said I I'm busy! And so are you! Go get cleaned up!
Congratulations, Ensign Mayo, sir!
See you in the fleet, sir!
Hi, son.
What did you call me, boy?
Before that.
What did you call me, Mayo?
Now when I say "understand" I want the whole group to say, "Yes, sir!" Understand?
Louder!
Stop eyeballing me, boy! You are not worthy enough to look your superiors in the eye. Use your peripheral vision! Understand?!
I know I'm late and I'm sorry, but Mrs. Rufferwell asked us to help with the cleanup and...
I don't know what it is. It could be anything.
You been through the Dilbert Dunker yet?
Is your brother a flyer?
You're sure it's okay?
By the way, shouldn't you have had a period by now?
Exactly how late are you, Lynette?
Sid! Oh, it's beautiful! You mean...
I'm not pregnant. I got my period this morning. There's no baby, Sid.
Well, it you're not gonna ask, then I will. How was it?
Paula, how far would you go to catch Zack?
You know what I mean. Would you... let yourself get pregnant?
My father is a Rear Admiral in the Seventh Fleet.
I hear most of the girls who come to these things are looking for a husband.
Yeah? Why're you here?
I don't feel like talking, if you don't mind.
Want me to get a towel?
I don't want you to move.
You know, sometimes I wish I was one of those girls they're letting in the flight program these days. God, I'd love to fly.
My old lady swallowed a bottle of pills one day while I was at school.
I've seen all that a hundred times.
Come on. Invite me. All day the idea of a family Sunday dinner's been coming into my head. Since you're the only one I know around here with family...
I'm so embarrassed. I knew I shouldn't have brought you here.
Paula, he DORed and nobody's seen him.
However you got it figured, I didn't kill Sid and Lynette didn't kill him! He killed himself!
Two bucks a buckle, Perryman. Look at that shine! Boonies'll cost you five.
I'll never get it polished in time. Give me a buckle, Zack.
I see you didn't DOR, Mayo.
Hey, do you guys ever... feel like you don't belong here...?
Look at Foley! Can you believe it!
You okay?
What's the matter, Sweet Pea. Foley finally starting to get to you?
She's the sweetest person I've ever known. Loves kids. Works with handicapped kids every afternoon at the church. Everybody loves her.
Okay, but what if it's like Foley said and she got knocked up, to trap you -- is it still your responsibility?
Please, Zack -- go back to the barracks!
There is not one thing funny here.
Stop it!  Stop it!
Yes.
One.  Squeeze.
Th --
You got an idea?
-- posed to mean?
The walls are steel, right?
They're not supposed to be here!
Forty-five minutes.  That's all you said you need.  That's like nothing.
Where did you get this clown?
What tables?  I've never seen him before.
Not if we keep 'em here.  You can't kidnap somebody in their own house. It's just breaking and entering, unless we take 'em someplace.  Or something like that, I'm pretty sure.
Be quiet.
Cell phone.
And we're never getting in.
We're not leaving.  I'm getting in that room, and I'm opening that safe.
Yeah?
Could the child please stop that?
Oh, I've seen these...
Hey, this is perfect for you...  Absolutely!  You're a woman, you're living alone now.  Your alarm goes off, or you head glass break, or for whatever reason you think someone's broken into your home in the middle of the night.  What are you going to do?  Call the police and wait until they get here on Tuesday?  Traipse downstairs in your sexy little underthings and check it out?  I think not!
A what?
That's highly inappropriate.
Watch your mouth.
"Half?"  What did you, take a nap in math class?  Three people, three shares, one third.  Four point six six six repeating.
That's right, Raoul, it wasn't your idea, none of this was your idea, it was mine, it's my family we're ripping off, it's my prick grandfather who built that fucking room, it was my idea to get the plans, I found the floor safe, and it was my idea to ask a guy who builds these rooms to help break into one!  Me, me, me, I, I, I, at no point did I say "you" or Raoul," got it?
We're leaving.
Makes me nervous.
Old Bernie didn't miss a trick with this room, did he?
478...
What?!
Can't hear a thing.
What if they get in here?
I heard you.
YOU HAVE TO!
Morse code?
Do it.
If it looks like I can't get back, just close the door.
Strip 'em, expose the ends, try blue first, blue is phones!
He'll do something.
He'll know we're in trouble.  He heard me, I said "There are three..."
Okay, listen, honey, you went double digit here, you must have been shooting out adrenaline like crazy, we gotta bring your blood sugar back up, okay?  Can you hear me?
Okay now, er, Huey, so what's your telephone number?
What? We're the leadership, you and me. There ain't enough of us to...
So... we understand each other Judge?
Get out of the car.
Inspector Brimmer
Hey... what the hell you doing?
Sabu, what the fuck you doing? Ain't nobody gonna push on this street.
Motherfucker... you stay away...
Hey, it's the invisible man. Brother where you been?
Don't I know it. Come on in Agent Rodgers. Sit down. Always a... pleasure to see you. How can I be of help?
I want it duly noted, that this operation was entirely under the auspices of the Oakland Police Department. The FBI doesn't have a monopoly on agents infiltrating enemy organizations, my friend. As I've said before, Agent Rodgers, we have things under control in our city...
The time, my friend, is what Sartre called, "the moment the match is being put to the fuse." Question is, is the hand holding that match gonna be black or white.
Huh, well then...  did someone else start shooting?
Did you shoot the officers in question?
...at least that takes Bobby Seale off the street...
We're working on that...
Granted, the Free Huey thing has become a bit of a rallying cry for the left...
This here's a "Panther Patrol." We see a brother getting busted. We check it out, make sure the pig don't go beating on the man. Brother gets taken downtown, we post bail, hook 'em up with a lawyer.
Huey man I got to talk with you...
That's right. We'd be proud to provide as escort for Malcolm's widow. How many men you got?
We put our lives on the line today. Malcolm X's widow was on the line today. And your guns weren't even loaded.
Me? You've got a whole lot of other folks signing up. Why me?
Yeah well, they want a lot for their money. They want a felony, preferably with "violent intent." We've got to give them something. They'll kill me if I don't. And the Panthers are going to kill me if I do. I'm scared.
Don't let the cops provoke you. We're there to watch and take badge numbers...
You're a smart brother... you should dig what Huey and Bobby got to say...
You got something on your mind... "brother."
We'll all get out of here together.
God damn it's him. I gotta go.
Yeah.
I hear them boys, those Black Panthers, they're communists. They don't even believe in God.
I'm sorry we didn't give you more warning.
Congratulations.
If I'd known you were going to look like this, I never would have put ink in your tea.
Maybe we'll be lucky this winter and have just rain, no snow.
You expect to hold Cornwallis with militia?
Am I one of that sort?
What do you mean, old and ugly?
I know him well enough?
And send us to war alongside Massachusetts.
I should have known... once I would have... I used to be wary... and today I watched my son killed before my eyes... your sister civilized me and I damn myself for having let her...
Excuse me?
What unit?
Shall we proceed?
First, you have in your possession certain belongings of mine, including clothing, private papers, furniture and personal effects of a non-military nature which I would like to have returned to me.
Very well, let us move on to...
My harrier.  Join us, Colonel.
Colonel Tarleton, you deal with these damned rebels.
And if I triumph, you triumph.
Father, a post rider came from Charleston.  You have a letter inside.
What news?
Alright, Corporal, you take Bennington, Harrisville, Acworth and the farms along Black Swamp.  I'll take the north side of the river. We'll meet at Snow's Island.
Is it?
Gabriel?  Are you asleep?
Father, there's something else I need to talk to you about.
Sir, I'd like to request a furlough. Two days?
Don't go in there.
If this war is about more than Thomas, it's about more than Anne, as well.  Stay the course.
There are some letters here from him.  Some are just to you.
We saw.
And congratulations on the birth of your son.
You may, of course, keep your weapons, but I must warn you that...
Yes, quite, but you should know that...
Don't worry.
Margaret, take William and Susan to the river shed.  Hide there.  If we're not back by dawn, go up the river to the Richardson's house. They'll take you to your Aunt Charlotte's farm.  Nathan, Samuel, and I are going to get Gabriel.
Reverend.
Thank you.
Colonel, let us help his soul find it's place with the Almighty and...
I was sorry to hear about your son.
If Cornwallis receives news that Clinton is coming, he'll simply hold tight and wait.  He'll fight a purely defensive battle and he'll win that.
Seventeen.
Put those away.
Who might you be, little Miss?
Paxcow says it's almost too late!
Paxcow says Daddy's going to do something really bad. He--
There are no ghosts, Ellie. I want you to go to sleep and forget all this nonsense.
Hurrts! It hurrrrts!
No-I guess not.
Yes...I guess so. He was sleeping on the front porch when I left.
Because you promised.
She's in bed. She was throwing up. Ever since Mrs. Rogers called and said Missy--
At school Michael McDowell said she was gonna fry in hell. Michael McDowell says all sewersides fry in hell.
Yeah, sure.
Was it Pascow?
Not yet...how much further is it?
I can hardly read these.
My wife is not crazy about cemeteries of any kind. As you may have noticed.
Loved that cat pretty well, didn't she?
No, you shouldn't have stopped. But you got away with it. Important thing is are you sure you're all right?
I had my reasons, Louis. We'll talk later. All right?
What are those for?
Doesn't look like they last long.
Can I have another one?
They buried their dead and for a long time their dead stayed buried. Then something happened. Half the tribe died in a season. The rest moved on. They said a Wendigo had soured the ground.
You and this old Indian rag-man--
A man doesn't always know why he does things, Louis. I think I did it because your daughter ain't ready for her favorite pet to die.
Rachel not feeling well?
Out of the mouths of babes, Louis.
I know the Micmacs thought it was a holy place...and then they thought it was a cursed place. That's why they moved on.
Leave me alone!
Thank you. Thank you so much.
You're not really going over to have a beer with that old guy, are you?
My God!
Don't be silly. Church is not going to die.
Thank you, Louis.
Enough of that!  Name your terms.
Hah.  Ten years you carried that pistol, and you end up wasting your shot.
I know whose blood you need, to end the curse.
It's pure evil to make a Captain walk the plank of his own ship, twice in one lifetime.  No good can come of it.
No, I really think I do.
Like after you've killed ... Every ... Last ... One ... of Norrington's men.
Looks like your back to having nothing to offer.
That's proper, sir, according to the code.
No, no, nothing like that.  Very well.  You hand that over, we'll put your town to our rudder and ne'er return.
I think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate.
Actually, I find it all fascinating.
Elizabeth? Is everything all right? Are you decent?
It's -- beautiful. May I inquire as to the occasion?
Although ... I did think you could wear it to the ceremony today.
Miss Swann.
You are despicable.
Has it changed since the last time you were here?
Captain Sparrow!  We have to get off this island -- immediately!
You didn't tell Commodore Norrington everything.
Blast it, I'm already awake!
It's a signal.  If we resist, it won't just be death.  There'll be torture as well.
Hands!  Come about!  Jackets off the cannons!  We are to fire on our own ship?
All the men in place, sir.  Ready to fire.
Agreed.  You have the momentary advantage, sir.  But I will see you smile from the yard arm, sir.
We had time to get to know each other.
That chart I drew up'll get you past the reefs.  If you're steersman's good enough, that is.
You look familiar ... Have I ever threatened you before?
Who makes all these?
You cheated.
Where does it make berth?
Never.  They took Miss Swann.
I knew him.  Probably one of the few he knew him as William Turner. Most everyone just called him Bill, or 'Bootstrap' Bill.
Good man.  Good pirate.  And clever -- I never met anyone with as clever a mind and hands as him. When you were puzzling out that cell door, it was like seeing his twin.
Put it away, Will.  It's not worth getting beat again.
Shut up, before you lose them all!
But I survived.  And I still have that single shot.  It's meant for one man.  My mutinous first mate--
Will -- don't do anything stupid! Don't say anything stupid --
Oh, and no ship that's not crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out could possibly have black sails and therefore couldn't possibly be any ship other than the Black Pearl.  Is that what you're saying?
I think he's telling the truth.
That Jack Sparrow ... he talked about the Black Pearl.
He's still breathing.
Well, she had a very taxing day... Ghastly weather tonight.
How long do you leave him in there?
You can't mean that.
What did you use?
Yes, that's true.  We have to find him, run tests, determine if the polymerization is stable.
You know how I feel about you.  You know how much I need you.  How much I trust you.  I would do anything for you.
Icarus?
I was wondering if you'd finished considering?
She could have given him something to stimulate his kidneys.
Where did he go?
Hey!
Yeah, I do!
Haw-haw!  Why don't you run off and find a cop and I'll wait right here.
What?  Oh, I'm sorry, Nigel.  I was just thinking...
There's a guard outside my door! I'm a prisoner, Nigel!  Do you understand that?
Sir, please try to hold still.
I remember you said, nanotechnology was going to change the world.
I've read they're using it to repair cancer cells.
Yeah.
And what I love about molecular science is the way it revolutionizes how we have to think.  It unifies the entire world on a single level. Everything is completely connected. Sometimes I can really feel it, everything around us, just a small part of a whole.  It's really wonderful.
Please, Susan!  I need help! Something is wrong with me!
We don't have time for hysterics.
What are these?
Pills... you know how I feel about pills.
The replicators start off like assemblers, but the replicators never stabilize.
I think while we're waiting, we had better run some basic diagnostics on you.
Oh yeah, real funny.  Yuk-yuk. Let's laugh at everything a man believes in.
You have no one to blame but yourself.
Victim my ass!  You stole my security key and used it to break into my lab to do who knows what kind of damage!  Maybe this is the end of the story and you finally got what you deserved!
You're not protecting the world, you're obstructing progress!
I want you to know that I really appreciate you helping me.
That's pretty good.
Did you go?
Run, Daniel!  Get out of here!
What in the...?
All the different ways that I could kill you.
That's impossible.
Vermin...
Under the circumstances, I can't fathom what makes Dr. Argon think we are ready for anything bigger.  If C.N.N., or hell, if the E.P.A. knew what was in my basement --
You know something, lady, if you sold life insurance, I'd go for a policy in sixty seconds.
What do you want?
That's considerate of you.
Will you step into the library?
Will - uh - five thousand be enough?
You're a peculiar person. Why the other day I pleaded with you not to send in that story and 
You're a bit eccentric, aren't you?
I'm just beginning to believe that something could be done with you.
Don't you think it's silly of us to think of living there when we have this whole big house
We could have the whole left wing? Wouldn't that be nice! Would that be room enough for us?
What do you think my friends would say if they found me in a little cheap flat?
Anne, prepare yourself for the treat of your life. This is Gallagher.
You know, Stewart, you failed to mention that Miss Gallagher was a very beautiful young girl.
Yes. As a matter of fact, you failed to mention that Gallagher was a girl.
Fine!  I don't blame her. I know I'm out of my own crowd. I should have had better sense in the beginning. But I'll stay in my own backyard from now on.
It's a good thing your father passed away before he saw insanity ravage the family. I can't imagine what made you do such a thing. A reporter! Of all things, a reporter! A barbarian who lets his socks come down!
Good morning, Mother. Didn't I tell you that he'd be marvelous. Everybody thought he was so charming last night.
You don't have anything to complain about, Mother. He was all right last night, wasn't he? I told you not to worry about him.
a beautiful pair of shoulders! But listen now, as a favor, will you please make it snappy, Laughing Waters,[14] and tell Stew Smith I gotta see him because if you don't my whole family's going to die.
This way.
I got him his job on the paper. I'm a stock-holder, you know.
Yeah!
Impossible. Put it on again.
Big Chief Bingy come to white man's tepee to make friends. Big Chief very sorry. To show how sorry - will bend over and let white man kick Big Chief where sun never shines.
Well, Stew, that's all thrashed out. By golly, I'm surely glad to see that you're not really sore. You know our racket - after all, news is news.
Aagh! No wonder you're batty. Would it be imposing too much upon you if I asked you to do a little work today? Just to sort of break the monotony?
Yeah, little Gloria.
Come on, get going, get going!
Now listen boss, if you're going to kick about that expense account
Gallagher and myself just came over here to do a little work on a story -
What play?
Well, I'm sorry to see a good reporter go blooey  Let me know when you're quitting.
All right, outside!
Yes.
You're sure going to be poison to that Junior Leaguer[4] from now on!
For heaven's sake, Stew, are you completely bats? What for? I thought the story was cold. You can't go back there.
Sure, sure. You've got a nose, Gallagher. You've got a nose. But there's different women, Gallagher. You know, like brewery horses and thoroughbreds.
There you go, talking like a woman!
Well, well, well! Gallagher, old pal! There you are. What did you run away for?
Sure, you ran away. Aren't you going to congratulate a guy?
Thanks, thanks.
Oh no, you won't, Mr. Smith. You're a married man now. Mother always warned me never to run around with married men.
Oh, I'll call you up some time. And if your social duties permit - why -
Don't pay attention to him, Stew. He doesn't know what he's talking about.
Gee Gallagher, do you look good! What are you doing to yourself?
Well, Gallagher! Glad to see you.
How far have you gotten?
Did who?
Didn't he go to sea before he wrote about it?
I wouldn't worry too much about it, Stew. She'll see it your way.
Never mind that. If you can't get my breakfast ready - and can't get here on time in the morning - then you can go get yourself another job.
What did he want?
Nice set of Conrads you have out there, Mrs. Schuyler. I was just glancing through this one.  What's Michael tearing the paper about?
Rumors? Rumors? Since when is a breach-of-promise case a rumor?
Pardon me, madam. They phoned through from the Mayor's committee to remind you it's past the hour for the reception.
As a matter of fact, I was just trying to decide the color of Anne's eyes. I can't tell whether they're blue, or whether they're violet. What would you say, Mrs. Schuyler?
Good morning, everybody  Well, maybe it isn't a good morning, huh?  Anne, did you ever get the feeling that there was someone else in the room with you?
And you struck him right here in our house?
Heavens! The man's insane!
There are no gentlemen on the Tribune.
Did you call, sir?
No, that's enough. I just wanted you to get the idea. Now you know. This house is haunted.
Well, isn't that nice? You just go right ahead and putter with your hands. That's all right. How do you do it?
It isn't done, gentlemen! It isn't done, I say! It isn't done!
What goes on up at Lover's Lane?
Yes ...  It's just that ...
Why no. She's still on her date with Biff ... is something the matter?
Does it look okay?
And they won't be able to tell?
Wait.
I'm so proud of you, Bud.
Having kind of a tough time.
Isn't it great how she's resting like that?
What?
I got caught in the storm. You were gone all night too.
Look at me George. That meeting's not for me. Look at my face.
Okay--now you listen to me ...  You're gonna come to this meeting and you're gonna put on this make up, and you're gonna come home at six o'clock every night and have dinner ready on this table.
What's all the commotion? Where's the cat?
So I know I haven't been steady with anybody, but I just don't want to rush it. You don't want to make a mistake with something that important.
... Why?
It's s'posed to happen, Biff.
You want to ask her out tonight, right? And then you want to give her your school pin ...
What'll it be?
Want some bridge mix?
Betty's making some pineapple kabobs ...
Do you know that it's illegal?
You're not allowed to do this! I could arrest you for this.
Bud Parker and William Johnson, you have been charged with desecration of a public building and the intentional use of prohibited paint colors in violation of the Pleasantville Code of Conduct and laws of common decency. Do you admit that on the night of May 1, you did consciously and willfully apply the following FORBIDDEN colors to the Pleasantville Town Hall:  Red, Pink, Vermillion, Puce, Chartreuse, Umber, Blue, Aqua, Ox Blood, Green, Peach, Crimson, Yellow, Olive and Magenta.
It's like the basketball team.
YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER!
What do you mean!?
And where's that?
Oh my God ...  Oh my God ...
Lemme see that.
I don't believe this.
Does he--you know--like "me"?
JENNIFER!
You have no right to do this.
I had nothing to do with that fire.
Sure.
No. She really liked you.
Can I ask you a question?
And you're sure about this?
That was sure swell ...
Hi.
You want some berries?
Salesman. What did Bud and Mary Sue name the cat they found in the gutter?
A thousand dollars ... And it's on all night?
I know how I'd feel if mine went out. Almost like losing a friend.
McIntire's.
Say--why don't you take this remote instead. It's got a little more "Ooomph" in it.
So even though I can't make any promises, well--I figured if you asked me real nice--I might just be willing to talk about it again.
What?
I'll be honest with you Bud. I'm getting sorta concerned about what I'm seeing in some of these re-runs ...
Excuse me?
BUD.
OKAY. NOW YOU'RE REALLY STARTING TO PISS ME OFF!
So ... I guess as long as I'm here, all sorts of things could happen to this place. We could have pink lawns and blue trees ...
What's wrong?
You know, if this ever happens again, you can make the fries even if I haven't put out the napkins yet.
Well, usually I put out the burger and then you finish with the lettuce ...
Oh hi!
Bud ...
Two cheeseburgers, two cherry cokes.
Look. I thought we talked about this, I thought we said ...
You know what I really like?
Aren't you a little early?
What's wrong?
Well how do you know it won't go back to the way it was?
Gosh, I loved that show. Watched it for years.
Oh GOD ...
Saw you at the mall yesterday.
So you watching Pearl Jam on MTV tonight?
Did you think that we'd all be looking at you?
...yes I'm still on hold...
It's extension 215 if you want to try me back.
Hey, how are you? BARRY I'm fine, hi, how are you?
I don't think I'm going to the party.
Yeah, no, it's not, it's just --
Hey, what are you doing? Why are you wearing a suit again?
Why?
Hey, hey, you should ask her out -- what do you think, she's cute, right?
I'll leave then, I'll go to get something from my car, go away so you don't feel pressure. Can I ask you a serious question:
Why's it here?
Hey. What are you doing?
What about her? You didn't ask her out, you're such a pussy --
No she didn't; that's a lie.
What? Tell me why you wanna know --
-- what are you talking about, come on --
Yes.
Sure.
Really?
No.
Does Jack like to Jack Off?
...yeah....well you have me now.
Hi....what....what's up....?
I know but I....how much is it?
Should I call back and talk to your girlfriend?
Hello?
Should I just ask your girlfriend?  Maybe I should call back and talk to your girlfriend?
You lied to me?
Are you telling me no?
Can I ask you, can I trust to leave my keys with you and give them to you so that when they get here you could give them to them? BARRY Ok.
There's a piano in the street.
Business is good, you're busy?
Do you have brothers or sisters?
That's great -- Hawaii. I was thinking about going there.
I didn't ask anyone for a shrink, that was someone else. Also: This pudding is not mine. Also: I'm wearing a suit because I had a very important business meeting this morning and I don't have a crying problem.
How long have you known her?
So that pudding was bought, I bought that pudding because of a pretty interesting promotion that's sponsored by Healthy Choice and American Airlines. It's designed to encourage airline travel and obviously designed to encourage buying Healthy Choice products. They make frozen meals, deli meats, pasta sauce, breads, soups and ice creams, this sort of thing.....
You see?
....No....
No I didn't say that.
Your portable reed organ....the piano.
That was good.
I'll see you later.
Hello?
I just wanted to make sure.
You got me out of my hotel room. You came and got me out of my room.
I just...your face is so adorable and your cheek and your skin, I wanna bite it....I wanna bite your cheek and chew on it....god damn cute....fuck....
I forgot about that.
Yes I'm sorry.
Lena I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry that I left you at the hospital..... I called a phone sex line. I called a phone sex line before I met you and then these four blond brothers came after me and you got hurt and I'm sorry -- and I had to leave because I don't want you to get hurt again and now I'm here and I'm back and I have a lot of pudding that I can redeem in six to eight weeks and if you give me that much time I can get enough miles to fly with you wherever you have to go if you have to travel for your job because I don't want to be anywhere without you.....can you please let me redeem the mileage?
Can I pay you here? Can I pay you for our drinks and salad?
And your Social Security number.
Of course, it's just for us to verify your credit card information. It's completely confidential and it appears on your credit card billing statement as D&D Mattress Man.
That's fine. Can I have a telephone number, area code first on where we can call you back?
It's a call back service -- a girl will call you back.
YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. MY LOVE WAS HURT, SHE GOT HURT. I AM IN LOVE WITH HER AND YOU HURT YOU AND YOU ARE GONNA FUCKING GET HURT. YOU DON'T TOUCH HER, I LOVE HER.
You do guaranteed sale? etc.
How many sisters do you have?
Yeah.
Ok, sir....I'm gonna put you through to my supervisor.
Good morning, Barry....
That's part of a very interesting airline promotion giveaway that's really tremendous. I'm going to start a collection of pudding and coupons that can be redeemed for frequent flyer miles through Healthy Choice and American Airlines --
No.........but airline miles are just like a currency these days.
Which guy in Toledo are you talking about?
What's up?
You know you can get places in the world with pudding. That's funny.
Whoa...whoa...wait, wait -- don't please....
Yes.
I'm sorry.
This is Barry.
Hi, Kathleen, I'm just working.
Nothing.
I know.
I know.
That's cool.
Hello?
He's wearing a suit again, I don't know why he's wearing a suit, he doesn't usually dress like that --
It's ok, it's alright. I'll come right back, I'll just go pay for my car.
So...did my brother call you?
I think he's weird, but that's me.
Of course, everything's not as harmonious as it seems. I hope you've a strong constitution.
If you're going to slander him, then you don't deserve to hear his stories --
"To seal the wound, he took a poker from the fire --"
Madeleine --
Has he hurt you?
It's a sin against God for me to refuse your kindness. But my heart's held fast here...
I must grant him his last rites.
I should've told you it was the blood of Christ; you'd believe that, wouldn't you?
I'm entertaining you now, aren't I?
I write of the great, eternal truths that bind together all mankind! The whole world over, we eat, we shit, we fuck, we kill and we die.
I thought that was your duty, Abbe, not mine.
It's that Doctor fellow, isn't it? He's come to usurp your place here, hasn't he?
They can't be serious.
You mean to take us all down with you?
He can't do that to me.
Perhaps -- in time -- you'll earn them back through good behavior --
I'll die of loneliness! I've no company but the characters I create --
My bed, gone! Am I to freeze to death?
That's a Turkish weave, you numbskull; it costs more than you'll earn in your lifetime --
What on earth would that require?
OFF WITH YOUR CLOTHES!
Oh, I'm to be blamed now, am I?
It's no secret that you loved her.
IT'S NOT YOUR PROVINCE TO ASK.
Who's to say I did not?
NEVER!
Surely you'll grant me a final word.
Of course.
If you don't mind my asking... why has the Emperor taken such sudden interest in my... our... affairs?
I understand he practices the very crimes he preaches in his fiction.
He no longer roars or spits. He no longer taunts the guards or molests his fellow wards --
Oh. That.
I've taken vows to live my life within these walls; not outside them.
In their eyes, the Marquis is the surest barometer of your progress here.
On the contrary. Let me take up this matter with the Marquis myself --
He's more than a patient, Doctor; the Marquis is my friend --
I have.
You ought to be ashamed, Abbe. Exploiting those drooling, pathetic cretins for financial gain --
This child let loose the beast from its cage --
And you? It must've been an ordeal.
Yes?
Charenton? The administrator there is quite well-loved, is he not?
His wife was trying to escape; they caught her on the stair, and set upon her with bayonets.  "There but for the grace of God"... eh, Doctor?
Quickly, my suckling, out of your clothes! My scepter awaits; how solid it grows!
My darling, Eugenie, dainty morsel! Get on your back! Let's try it dorsal!
I'll plunder every lovely pore until you're week and cry "no more!"
Did I frighten you?
It's the only frontier I have left, plumcake.
You've already stolen my heart, as well as another more prominent organ, south of the Equator...
Surely you've seen a man naked.
Yes; that's it! A final volley from us both!
Tomorrow night, whisper a new tale to your neighbor, Cleante. He'll whisper it to his neighbor Dauphin, who'll whisper it to his neighbor Franval --
"...your wife."
"By the time you read this, we'll be long gone; bound for England or points beyond..."
Perhaps if you were to buttress your entreaties with the means to oblige them...
Don't toy with me, Doctor.
How was I to know, my darling?
To flaunt your deviance in public? Upon a stage?
And we would hear them scuttling around at night with their little red eyes and little yellow t-t- teeth and I'm just imagining plague lice jumpin' all over the damn place So we set t-t-traps everywhere. And every morning we would find the t-t-traps sprung but no mice!
God, these parties are the worst
Yeah, Orson's a real piece of work. But deep down, he's a good kid. Real deep down.
Well, I wish you luck. It is a treacherous business.
I wonder. Do you have any idea what you have done?
Intimately. For every sin you have placed on my head I could give you a hundred others. I have been swimming in blood my entire life. But I retain a belief, perhaps you will think it old fashioned, undoubtedly you will, but I believe that private lives should not be public property.
Quite. And this is why I came to visit. Have you heard about this CITIZEN KANE picture?
This is supposed ta be Siam or some such. Some kinda lousy B-B-Balinese temple. This look like a temple to you? I can't see it myself--
He is a Bolshevik. He will have us at war by the end of the year. I think I'm going to run that wheelchair picture.
It's not really--
We're 125 million dollars in debt?
How does one get 125 million dollars in debt?
Well -- he got us, didn't he? She stands and goes quickly to pour a drink. A forced laugh
Marion--
This picture--
Did you need it? Did you need any of it?
There's a different between want and
The jigsaw puzzles and the, urn, career -- the man spending a fortune to make her a star -- only it's opera and not movies. And...
I pay you a good deal of money to be my eyes and ears in Hollywood, do I not? If you cannot provide this simple service you are of no use to me.
"Well, if you got drunk to talk to me about Miss Alexander, don't bother. I'm not interested. I've set back the sacred cause of reform, is that it? All right, if that's the way they want it, the people have made their choice. It's obvious the people prefer Jim Gettys to me."
You're not going to get another chance, boy! Look right at the monster and you tell him--
Tome it's a question of truth and illusion. Don't you get tired of the errant falsity in motion pictures?
But you keep coming up with the same elitist crap - - HEART OF DARKNESS with a million dollar budget?! - - no one wants to see that.
So, we've got to come up with our movie. Our biography.
We find the man and then we dissect him-
But with compassion and insight--
How about Howard Hughes? We could do Hughes
Oh Christ...
Now remember he's a public figure who sought out that publicity so legally he can't stop us from--
Howard Hughes, he would just kill us. Hearst he would kill us and fuck everything we ever loved.
You may think you know what you're talking about, kid, but believe me, you don't. You're talking about going into a battle you can never win on a battlefield so far above things like movies and Hollywood that Hearst won't even have to glance down when he crushes you. When he flicks you away with one finger. I'm talking about money and influence and evil beyond your capacity to imagine Hell.
He'll destroy us.
Why her?
The people. When they pay him homage, he adores them. But when they have the ... audacity to question him. To doubt him. To embarrass him. Then he despises them.
Cain -- like the Bible guy?
Jesus Christ --
I want you back
No, but I can imagine. What am I today? A "puny upstart" or a "spoiled dilettante" -- no, she wouldn't know how to spell that
Hedy Lamarr?
Who owns this town? Who runs every goddamn studio? The tribe, baby. These fuckers hear the word "Jew" and they start sweating. Like Ester Williams' pool they start sweating.
Believe you me, they're gonna do anything -- and I mean absolutely anything -- to stop that word from gettin' out.
What have I done?
Well, this is a great pleasure. Miss Davies! I just saw that ENCHANTMENT is playing at a the Tivoli, the revival house in Santa Monica. That was a fine picture!
It came.
Very generous
Yes
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
The magazines are one thing -- but Hedda! Why did we have to let her come?!
What do you want me to do, Orson? Radio City won't premiere the picture. Louella threatened them with some bullshit about
For Christ's sake, shut up--
Do you every think for one second that you might have some responsibility for what you're doing?! For cutting and slashing everything in your way so you can have your goddamn movie?!
You're not still mad at me, I hope
It's my birthday this week. I'll be 26.
I need my shoes in total focus right here and also Joe back there--!
Take apart the fucking camera rig -- we could get a few more inches down and then tilt up--
I don't run the joint. They just told me to bring you in.
You just take it easy, now. You'll do all right. Feelin' Ok?
Look Joey, I wanna tell you something. Your brother ain't gonna get nowhere without us -- nowhere. And I'm tellin' you between the two of us, it's gettin' to the point where it's gettin' to be a real embarrassment to me, a real embarrassment.
I don't follow no gamblin' Commissioner. I'm just a fighter.
It looks done. I'll take it the way it is.
You want me to do what?
Hey, I don't care about Tommy Como. I don't care about Jesus Christ on the fuckin' cross. I gotta give them a percentage of what I make! I'm in here breaking my ass, not them. Don't ever bring them up here again.
Whadda ya mean, whadda I care? Who is she? What's a matter? You afraid I'm gonna take her on you?
Go 'head.
Do you see her yet?
They robbed us! Those fuckin' judges -- What the fuck fight were they watching? If I see them on the street, I'll break their heads. Decision Robinson, my fuckin' ass! Those judges give him the decision 'cause he's goin in the army next week! How else could this have happened?... What do you think they gave him the decision for, that's why.
Say what you're gonna say.
Whatcha doin'?
Jack, if there was anything funny, I would tell you.
Except fall down like a normal person.
Didn't it have nothin' to do with me?
You givin' me that look. I gotta accept your word, but if I find out anythin', I'm gonna kill somebody...
What do you mean, "you"?
Yeah. At night.
Are you sure we should be doing this?
Take off my pants.
Don't tell me "No." I saw you lookin' at him. Why, you like him?
Tell me, you think of anybody else when I'm making love to you?
What's the matter with you?
Jake, why don't you just try lying down and get some rest.
Sure, what else is new?
What are you doing?
Jake, be careful! What're you doing to the belt?!
Hi, Tommy. How are you?
Fuckin' kid! You're the best fuckin' fighter around. Loved what you did to Satterfield. Them "moulan yans" -- forget about it. They're all afraid to fight you.
Hey Joey, whadda ya lookin' to die young?
Try to understand, Vickie. Jake's got a lotta aggravation. He's been a top contender too long.
This is Doyle's house.
I'm hired 'til one. They went to dinner and maybe night-clubbing.
Indo-China -- Jeff predicted it would go sky-high.
Like disposing of their wives?
Mrs. -- Thorwald's -- clothes. -- Clean -- carefully packed -- not too stylish -- but presentable.
I'll admit it all has a mysterious sound -- but is could mean a number of different things. Murder is the least likely.
It's too stupid and obvious a way to murder -- in full view of fifty windows -- and then sit over there --  -- smoking a cigar -- waiting for the police to pick him up.
I think you saw something -- that probably has a very simple explanation.
Who said they left then?
At the risk of sounding stuffy, Jeff -- I'll remind you of the Constitution, and the phrase "search warrant" issued by a judge who knows the Bill of Rights verbatim. He must ask for evidence.
I can hear myself starting out. "Your Honor -- I have a friend who's an amateur sleuth, an one night, after a heavy supper --"  He'd throw the New York State Penal Code right in my face. -- And it's six volumes.
Did you ever own a saw?
Like Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring. If that woman were still alive, she'd be wearing it.
A fact! Last night he killed a dog for pawing in his garden. Why? Because he had something buried in there. Something a dog could scent.
For what?
Swell. I get myself half-killed for you -- and you reward me by stealing my assignments.
Read some good books.
It's about time you got married -- before you turn into a lonesome and bitter old man.
Yeah? Maybe in the high rent districts they discuss -- but in my neighborhood, they still nag.
Yeah. Is that you, Jeff?
Well -- did you get it, Thorwald?
How can you tell that from a thermometer!
Gives your circulation something to fight.  What kind of trouble?
Behind every ridiculous statement is always hidden the true cause.  What is it? You have a fight?
She's only perfect.
The insurance Company would be a lot happier if you slept in your bed, not the wheelchair.
Eyes bloodshot. Must have been staring out the window for hours.
Keep your mind off her.
Isn't there anyone in the neighborhood who might cast an eye in her direction?
He and his wife splitting up?
Mrs. Thorwald?
What are you two talking about?
Smart? She'll be arrested!
It is something really important, Jeff?
I'll have him call the moment I hear from him.
And your stomach?
And you love life?
That dress should be listed on the stock exchange.
What a day I've had!
Make the one you want.
Don't laugh. -- I could do it!
Lisa, simmer down -- will you?
Oh, I do that all the time. Whenever I have a few minutes after lunch.
Not quite -- it seems.  Goodbye, Jeff.
I'm not exactly on the other side of the room.
So do I.
What do you think?
Sitting around, looking out a window to kill time, is one thing -- but doing it the way you are --  -- with, with binoculars, and with wild opinions about every little movement you see -- is, is diseased!
Maybe she died.
Lisa, please!
He had it hidden in the dresser! Well, at least it was in there. He took it out, went to the phone and called somebody long distance. -- His wife's jewelry was in the handbag. And something about it worried him. He was asking somebody advice over the phone.
I have the whole weekend off.
You are. You have a talent for creating difficult situations.
I hate funny exit lines.
Of course, they have the same chance. They can look at me like a bug under glass, if they want to.
Whatever happened to that old saying "Love Thy Neighbor."
I'll rephrase the question.
Do you like it?
Something's in there. Those flowers have been taken up, and put back again.
Wasn't that close?
What for?
I'll try to give you at least fifteen minutes.
Nobody chickened.
Hey, he's real abstract and different.
Meaning me?
Machismo?
You satisfied or you want more?
Where can we meet?
Buzz Gundersen.
We heard firing.  He get anybody? You alone?
No.  We're going to bring him down.
You can't protect me.
You buy me many things.  Thank you.
Mother--
You thought I was Mom?
You awake?
Blood.
Go ahead.
Well, just get it off your chest, son.
Except yourself!
Excuse us a minute?
I'm just explaining what you mean! You can't be an idealist all your life!  Nobody thanks you for sticking your neck out!
Frank?  I'm frightened.
They not together, sir.  We don't see him in a long time now.
He's not here.  He's not at Juvenile Hall.  I don't know where he is.  He's out on a call and he'll be out all night.  How old are you?
Come back tomorrow.
Hi.
What's your name!
Listen, I told you not to fool with them.  Now they're waiting for you.
You scared?
He has a knife.
Jim--Do you think when the end of the world comes it'll be at night?
We're safe here.  I hope.  What do you think?
How do you know so much about this junk, Plato?
I came here before.
I don't want you for my father!
Boy, I'm blind as a bat!  You got a match?  I'm going to break my neck in here.  Where are you?
I'm not going to hurt you. PLATO Why did you run out on me?
In your pocket.  Give it to me.
Why?
I shot at one of them.
What happened, darling.  We were so worried.  I was going to take a sleeping pill, but I wouldn't till I knew you were home.
Someone should put poison in her epsom salts.
A zoo.  He always wants to be my pal, you know?  But how can I give him anything when he's--I mean I love him and I don't want to hurt him--but I don't know what to do anymore except maybe die.
If he could--
I mean if he had the guts to knock Mom cold once I bet she'd be happy and I bet she'd stop picking.  They make mush out of him.  Just mush. One thing I know is I never want to be like him.
"Life can be beautiful." Hey, I know where it was.
See, I'm new.
The kids take me.
You still pretty upset?
Where can we go?  I can't go back into that zoo.
Well--we're newlyweds.
Of course.  Drown them like puppies.
Ever been in a place like this before?
Want to read any books?  Take your pick!  Isn't this the craziest?
Is this what it's like to love somebody?
You smell like baby powder.
What's he like?
Don't give it a thought.  Only three million dollars a month!
Is that why you were wandering around at one o'clock in the morning?
You weren't looking for company, were you?
Your mother will be down in a few minutes.
She's being called for.
But the same song.  I think it's fantastic!
You're too old for that kind of stuff, kiddo.  I thought you stopped doing that long ago.
Why?
Must have a way with stationery.
Read you're a man of some knowledge.
Is this him!?
Gabriel, you promised!
I can't take watching you touch him. I can't take his hands on you.
You can't find... what?
Negative five?
I don't think it's negative five.
Saw me --
Guy I was in with... he helped sometimes... some of the romantic stuff, actually... you'd like him --
He read the letters, Nick. Some day I wasn't there. He went through my room. He found your letters.
Nick died for me....
He working for them on this one?
We'll get there, baby... we'll get there...
How are we gonna do this, Nick?
No.
What?
You said Merry Christmas, Rudy.
Who are you now.
You're not Nick Mason...
But you were saying you were...
So you could get with my sister.
Hey. She says she loves you, Nick.
What'd they call her in high school?
What's her greatest fear?
How much money's in that casino? Day-to-day.
You wrote Ash that letter, you told her that story 'bout working Christmas Eve, bout how they'd send half the security guys home, nobody comin, in that night. And the rest of you got shit-faced drinking hot buttered rum. That a true story now?
You do.
A for effort, Nick, honestly, A for effort and an honorary degree. I'm surprised you never escaped from the Mountain.
You were talking to him! What'd you tell him!?
He thought I was some gambler... he didn't know me... he didn't recognize me!
NO.
No gun.
Can't be attracting attention, right?
Mister. I'm begging, 'kay? I'm begging. This is not some card club, 'kay? This is the Tomahawk. We're an international gaming destination. We're in guidebooks. You can't do this... you can't do this to me...
THE POWWOW SAFE! WHERE IS THE POWWOW SAFE!
The Powwow Safe where you steal your money! Where you cheat your Indians!
...so where is he?
I got a bacon too; there another bacon in there?
You gotta get someone upstairs.
We walk outta here, we hit that road, what's the first thing you're gonna do.
She's gonna be out there, man. Right there. Right there waiting.
Why you gotta. We were gonna give you a ride someplace, man. Now I just don't know.
For twenty-five, she sounds pretty mature.
She's using a new perfume.
All I want... is to make it to Sidnaw, and sit down for Christmas dinner. Watch some ball with my old man, sleep in my old bed, and have leftovers for bout six months.
Don't look like he missed the sunlight.
GUARD! GUARD!
Jesus, Rudy --
Tell her... I'll be there ...
NO!!!
Millie here used to serve drinks to these gunrunning truckers, real big talkers, talking bout a real score one day. I was in the Mountain, man, what the hell, why not let her get friendly with 'em? Let her tell 'em an idea she had, 'bout writing guys in prison. Getting one who could show 'em a sure thing.
Paid the Alamo ten bucks to put the shiv in me. He's a lifer, what does he care. Paid a hospital guard fifty to put out the story I was dead. Once the wound healed up...  Got out of the Mountain this morning. And tonight I'm a rich man.
Do what?
They had the weapons and the willpower. We just gave them their inside man.
Your boss even said there wasn't a set up.
I'm sorry man, I shoulda picked you up personally at the pen. This whole week's just been crazy. I've had my head up my ass the entire time.
I might break you, Nice Guy, but I'd make you my dog's bitch. You'd be suckin' the dick and going down on a mangy T-bone hound.
I don't wanna lift crates.
Jesus Christ, give me a fuckin' chance to breathe. I got a few questions of my own, ya know.
Now Vic was tellin' me, he's got a parole problem.
We can work this out, can't we?
Daddy, I'm sorry, I don't know what's happening.
I don't know, but somebody did.
The black Beverly Hills. I knew this lady from Ladora Heights once.  "Hi, I'm from Ladora Heights, it's the black Beverly Hills."
He's right about the ear, it's hacked off.
Who, Mr. White?
The way they talk to each other. You can tell they're buddies.
The Brewers.
Didja use the commode story?
What?
...Her brother usually goes with her, but he's in county unexpectedly.
Mr. Brown?
Who's your parole officer?
I just wanted you to know, they meant a lot.
That's great, guy, thanks a bunch.  When do you think you'll need me for real work?
Hey, fuck all that, I'm making a point here. You're gonna make me lose my train of thought.
But he's OK. If he wasn't OK, he wouldn't be here. Okay, let me introduce everybody to everybody. But once again, at the risk of being redundant, if I even think I hear somebody telling or referring to somebody by their Christian name...  ...you won't want to be you. Okay, quickly.  Mr. Brown, Mr. White, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Blue, Mr. Orange, and Mr. Pink.
Nobody's trading with anybody! Look, this ain't a goddamn fuckin' city counsel meeting! Listen up Mr. Pink. We got two ways here, my way or the highway. And you can go down either of 'em. So what's it gonna be, Mr. Pink?
For the past fifteen minutes now, you've just been droning on with names. "Toby... Toby... Toby... Toby Wong... Toby Wong... Toby Chung... fuckin' Charlie Chan." I got Madonna's big dick outta my right ear, and Toby Jap I-don't-know-what, outta my left.
You gonna put it away?
Not a problem, got guys waitin' for it. But what happened to Marsellus Spivey? Didn't he always move your ice?
What for?
Two minutes, tops. It's a tough two minutes. It's daylight, during business hours, dealing with a crowd. But you'll have the guys to deal with the crowd.
Joe, I don't know what you think you know, but you're wrong.
What the fuck are they waiting for? That motherfucker cut off my ear! He slashed my face! I'm deformed!
You talked to Nice Guy Eddie? Why the fuck didn't you say that in the first place?
I ain't going anywhere. I'm right here. I'm not gonna leave ya.
I wasn't born yesterday. I'm hurt, and I'm hurt bad.
Uhuh, uhuh, what's I tell ya? That sick piece of shit was a stone cold psycho.
Can you believe the songs they been playin'?
I'd go over twelve percent for that.
You really think we were set up?
I'm cool.
Could you believe Mr. Blonde?
I don't wanna kill anybody. But if I gotta get out that door, and you're standing in my way, one way of the other, you're gettin' outta my way.
What?
Oh, you and Joe go back a long time. I known Joe since I was a kid. But me saying Joe definitely couldn't have done it is ridiculous. I can say I definitely didn't do it, cause I know what I did or didn't do. But I can't definitely say that about anybody else, 'cause I don't definitely know. For all I know, you're the rat.
I gotta take a squirt, where's the commode in this dungeon?
So what is it?
Without medical attention, this man won't live through the night. That bullet in his belly is my fault. Now while that might not mean jack shit to you, it means a helluva lot to me. And I'm not gonna just sit around and watch him die.
Of course.
And I'm very sad about that. But some fellas are lucky, and some ain't.
Is that supposed to be funny?
I told ya he'd be pissed.
Who cares what your name is? Who cares if you're Mr. Pink, Mr. Purple, Mr. Pussy, Mr. Piss...
Who shot who?
It doesn't matter who they are.
What good is it going to do us to go to some ranch?
Thanks. And isn't there something we can do about supper -- or making the beds?
Where do you keep the can opener?
Steve maybe you better get some wood for the fire.
I don't know. I thought I did. Now I'm not sure. I thought it had something to do with me.
You know so much about me -- figure it out.
So grab yourself some sleep while you have the chance.
Thanks for taking over.
Because... well, you said you wanted a man to think enough of you to walk in the place you were working and take you out of there... tonight I was sort of tied up with Steve... but tomorrow I figured on doing just that.
Drop yours. I'm gunshy.
I -- lost something.
How does she draw?
But it's leaded up and anyway a 22's no good for real huntin'. You shoot a man with a 22 and where are you?
Sure a lot of guys lookin' for Lednov.
There was only three of them at first. I guess I lost my head.
They were quite a ways off and the wind was blowin'. I didn't have them to aim.
Yeah, it does.
Don't go arguing with your teacher.
All right, I hurt your feelings. But you know better than to go lightin' fires.
Half of them are mine.
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know who she was.
I can't take her with me.
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know you had a daughter.
Helen -- why don't you and Mary go on with Clay?
Of course I do -- but it'd be better for you -- and the house is kind of small --
I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying here where I belong.
Stop it -- stop it.
You're sure there's more where this came from?
Until you came along we were going to Sonora.
With a milk pail in one hand and a marriage license in the other.
How long do you think we'll have to stay here?
We might as well start a fire.
Give it back to him. We're leavin'.
-- Gaslights and a dance floor and a big bar. Cash registers with bells and a couple of boys with armbands just to keep 'em ringing. What do you think of that?
Because there's a man I want to see.
Aren't we stayin'?
And that's tough, isn't it?
U-n-i-c-o-r-n-... What in heck's that?
Nobody's gonna catch him sleeping. Don't worry about him.
She was only teasin'.
Goodnight.
Brenda was right. There's more to the story than the Professor told us. I found a secret room. It had all these news clippings about Hugh Kane. He was a very evil man.
Oh, remember that time I got my training bra and you --
Thanks.
Hello Brenda.
Shhh... It's okay.
Are you okay? I thought I heard screaming.
He's right. I should go first.
Hey, you left your book back there.
You know, Buddy, about this friendship thing...
Gentle stuff like talking, sharing thoughts and ideas, secrets and past experiences. Stuff like that, you know.
Yeah, it will be fine. I wanna check something out. Will you come with me?
What about you, Buddy?
What are we gonna do? I'm cold. I can't move, I'm so cold.
I know, but I've been thinking --
Look, what I'm trying to say --
Stop it! I'm just trying to say I think we should take our friendship to the next level.
What should we get?
Good-night, Cin. I'll be next door if you need me.
I'm sorry, I should have been watching where I...
How about these buns?
The ghost is close. He almost got us. Buddy is hurt.
Oh my God! I'm here with the...
I'm Cindy.
Ummm!! They smell delicious.
Tell me, Cindy. Would you ever tell me "Stop. If you loved me you'd stop."
Father!
I'm sorry.
Okay, I guess. It's so intimidating. You know being away from home, not knowing anyone. I feel like such a geek sometimes. Everyone's so cool and I'm so not.
Huh?
She'd have to be really pretty and I'd have to be very drunk.
Are you?
Got a problem with that?
I finished all the interviews.
Let me help you.
I have taken care of everything, including medical supplies and blood storage. We want to be safe.
What the hell?!
What are you working on?
Ooh, you hair is so soft and silky. What do you use on it?
You're not wearing a belt.
She's gotten worse, Father. She won't eat, she won't talk. The child won't even let me touch her.
Remember, don't ask her too many questions.
Yo son, check this out.
Sorry, y'all. My bad.
Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too.
BLOOD FEAST!
Bye, Mrs, Sutphin.
What a bitch!
0h, shit!
Hi!
DAD! YOU DON'T THINK SHE DID IT??!
Sure do. Did you bring back "Ghost Dad"?
Oh God, really!  This is the limit!
Ladies and gentlemen, the perfect meatloaf!
In here, Mom...
Get in, Mom! I have to open.
That's cool... hey look, you're Carl's brother, right?
Carl makes me happy and that threatens this family, doesn't it?
Home Sweet Home! Everything's fine, kids!
Yeah! Oohhhh! Get it!
Let's say grace and pray that we have the strength to understand the terrible tragedies of the last few days.
Det. Bradford, I'm sorry but we don't allow gum chewing in this house.
You bitch!
Who is this?
I know it's hard but we need the exact words.
Listen to your dirty mouth, you fucking whore!
Mrs. Hinkle... do you drink?
So you weren't drunk when you received those alleged obscene phonecalls?
Were you in the men's room at the Edmonson Drive In Flea Market on Saturday, September 19th?
You know how I hate gum, Misty. All that chomping and cheesing...
I'm stoodup! I'll kill that bastard!
You want me to keep that under the table for you?
Beverly, honey, you've got some...  ...do-do on your shoe.
And those were your scissors found sticking out of Mrs. Sterner's stomach, weren't they?
Mrs... Sutphin?
Mrs. Sutphin, I'm Paul Stubbins, Chip's math teacher.
Oooohh! A fruit cake. Thank you, Mrs. Sutphin. Have a seat.
Chip is off to a fine start this year.  Focused... conscientious... participates actively in classroom discussion.
What is it, Mr. Stubbins?
He is assistant manager of a video shop...
I'll take this instead.
Then you know that if I give you a little advice, it'll be good advice.
That girl was looking for Jacqueline Gibson. I'd forget it if I were you.
I've been waitin' for you Miss Gibson. I want you to know I've decided to take your case.
You scared?
Let's get out of here.
We can't stand here all night.
Then, you also understand that you must die.
I didn't. She came to me a few days ago. To put it delicately her care imposes a financial burden upon me. She thought you might lighten that burden.
I'll give you a check.
Why, Mary --
How's Miss Jacqueline?
Nothing's happened to her. It's just that I can't understand her not getting in touch with you.
She's a pretty good sort.
And that was all?
A man would look anywhere for her, Mary. There is something exciting and unforgettable about her - something you never get hold of - something that keeps a man following after her.
This is about another murder  a woman at Fifty Second Street
Yes, of course  but the police would say you'd probably had a bad dream.
I'm sorry. I didn't intend to treat you like a child.
You could have told me any time you were Jacqueline's husband.
Good night, Jacqueline -- good night, Mary.
I've never loved any one before, Gregory, and I do love you - you must know it -- but Jacqueline's my sister  whom I had lost and have found again....
I'm going to find your sister.
But I'm better than a detective. I have an understanding of people - and a love of them -- an understanding of the city - -
Well?
Do you think he knows about this?
He's clever and he's cautious in his way. If he knew I think he'd advise her to do what I want - surrender herself to the police  stand trial  I don't think he knows.
Let her know what?
Who are you?
No!
You'll be all right?
At least you knew about Dr. Judd.
It's not a searchlight  it's a sword blade cutting the blue cloak of a prince - not stars --
Why can't everyone be happy like we are -- laugh and have good times. Look at that poor little one  so sad because she can't find her sister. And that man with her - he doesn't make her laugh  he just sits and talks.
Oh, Mr. Jason. I really shouldn't be doing this, you know. It's against the rules.  When did you say you wanted them?
Why, Mr. Jason. Most of these books are on the closed shelf. You have to get permission.
What was she to you?
Following me to find Jacqueline?
Well, it won't work. Love and understanding won't make a good detective out of a recalcitrant poet.
And this poetry  like the poetry you wrote before extols the passion and beauty of life?
Wait - there is that other favor.
I suppose, Jason, that you'll speak for your friend --  -- and your poetry will speak for you.
A book of successful verse might have changed that, eh?
Dr. Judd?
Don't be so amazed. It's a very ordinary matter. I'm Jacqueline's physician... Mr. Ward told me you were in town and Jacqueline has sent me to bring you to her.
I was a great dancer...
But you must know someone who has seen or heard of my sister.
There's nothing you can think of -- old letters, anything, that might give me some hint as to where I might find Jacqueline?
I'm stopping at the Chatsworth.
Yes  yes, if she made that much impression on you, I'm sure it was Jacqueline.
But she was here?
We don't know, Mary. We've been unable to get in touch with your sister.
But, Mrs. Lowood, I can't just stay here not knowing what's happened to my sister. Maybe if I went to New York -- if I saw Mrs. Redi myself --
But he also wrote --
Jacqueline, you have spoken so often of ending it all, I can't understand why this should be so difficult for you. You have only to drink a little.
We... don't usually let people smoke in the house. We have a patio if you --
Well...
Oh, definitely. I mean, just this past year has gone by like phew! I hardly even knew it passed.
How long has it been since you've seen John?
Why? Didn't you know him well?
Why'd you drop out?
That's hard to believe. The two of you seem so different.
This food is excellent.
Do I pay taxes? Of course I pay taxes, only a liar doesn't pay taxes, I'm not a liar. A liar is the second lowest form of human being.
Maybe you'll understand this, because you know John, but he confuses me sometimes.
Does it bother you?
What?
My therapist said that --
So you don't believe in therapy?
Well, my therapist knows me intimately.
Hi!
I just wanted to see how the place looked furnished.
It's a personal project I'm working on.
Oh, just a personal project like anyone else's personal project. Mine's just a little more personal.
Because I enjoy interviewing women more than men.
No.
Like what?
I'm not sure why I came here. I had kind of decided not to talk to you after... you know.
John and Cynthia have been... "fucking".
How did you know?
Why didn't you tell me?
That's a good question.
Load a new tape, turn the camera on.
Yes. Whenever... all right, look. Whenever I see a man that I think is attractive, I wonder what it would be like with him, I mean, I'm just curious, I don't act on it, but I hate that I think that!! I wish I could just forget about that stuff!!
About who?
On tape?
That's correct.
No, it was wonderful. That wasn't the problem.
Yes. I did. Willfully and repeatedly.
You're really never going to make love again?
Like maybe a big part?
Whoa!! I'm so glad we got that on tape!! You won't answer a question about Elizabeth, but I have to answer all these intimate questions about my sex life!! Graham, what do you think she's going to make of all these videotapes? Are you going to tell her about them? I can't imagine her being too understanding about that. But since you don't lie anymore, you'll have to say something.
I don't find this "turning the tables" thing very interesting --
Yes. I just got busy.
Something wrong?
Ann, you are completely paranoid. Not ten minutes ago I wanted to make love for the first time in weeks, and you act like I'm dipped in shit. You know, I think there are a lot of women that would be glad to have a young, straight male making a pretty good living beside them in bed with a hard on.
Look, this conversation is utterly ridiculous. Maybe when you have some evidence, we should talk, but don't give me conjecture and intuition.
Goddam right. I mean, can you imagine: "Your honor, I'm positive this man is guilty. I can't place him at the scene or establish a motive, but I have this really strong feeling."
I'm sorry, too. I... I get these ideas in my head, you know, and I have nothing to do all day but sit around and concoct these intricate scenarios. And then I want to believe it so I don't think I've wasted the whole day. Last week I was convinced you were having an affair with Cynthia, I don't know why.
I don't know. Sometimes I feel stupid babbling about my little problems while children are starving in the world.
Where did you go when you left here?
Goddam right.
You son of a bitch!!
I have thought about it, yes.
But he asked you to quit your job, and you do have housework.
God, no.
What visitor?
Oh, Graham. No, I didn't talk to him about that. Actually, that turned out to be pretty interesting. I expected Graham to be this... well, like John, you know? I mean, he said they had gone to school together, so I was expecting lots of stories about getting drunk and secret handshakes and stuff. But he turned out to be this... this kind of character, I mean, he's kind of arty but okay, you know?
What brought this on?
I hate my sister.
I say it because it's descriptive.
What are you talking about?
Oh, please. Okay, so give me the Zen master's address, I'll think of a reason to stop by.
I don't... he doesn't want you to come over.
No, I didn't.
No!
No, he's not dangerous. Not physically.
He just asked me questions.
Apparently.
Because I wanted to.
He wouldn't do that.
No, but I did.
In front of him, Ann, yes.
You couldn't do it, period.
It's a sun dress.
So what's my share of the dress?
Did he ask me to take my clothes off? No, he didn't.
Do I know you?
The extrovert.
She didn't give you my address?
Nope. I think the man is a liar.
Oh, okay. I think I get it.
You just want to ask me questions?
How long will it take?
Do I sit or stand?
I never do more than one. I'm sorry.
I've got to get back to the office.
I wish you'd quit that bartending job.
Who said I was jealous?
I wish I could tell everybody that Ann's a lousy lay. Beautiful, popular, Ann Bishop Millaney.
Hello.
Not today. I've got other plans.
That you... you don't even know the guy.
Shit, after what you've told me, I don't know. I should've known, when he showed up dressed like some arty brat.
I felt like it, so what? Goddam, you and Ann make such a big deal out of it.
She's a grown-up, she can handle it.
No.
Oh, please. Come on, John. You're fucking your wife's sister and you hardly been married a year. You're a liar. But at least I know you're a liar. It's the people that don't know, like Ann, that have to watch out.
That's right. But I never took a vow in front of God and everybody to be "faithful" to my sister.
I know. Will you please leave now?
Student?
Not for three-fifty.
Everybody has a past.
I wish I didn't have to live someplace.
Answer him, goddammit!!
Mr. Millaney?
Mr. Millaney?
He said immediately.
No thanks. Just wanted to tell you that Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see Nick at ten or so.
Dr. St. Luc? Detective-Sergeant Heller. I'd like to ask you a few questions.
You knew these people?
It was very strange. He called me at six this morning. Hobbes called me. I thought I was dreaming. I haven't heard that voice for so long. He told me who it was, then he said something like, 'Meet me at apartment 1208 at noon. I want you to go out for lunch with me. It's time you furthered your education.' Then he laughed and hung up. I went back to sleep. He called me again at eight to remind me to come.
And that was her. Annabelle Horse... field.
Is that the man who called you up here?
Where is he now? Do you know?
Can I call you at the office?
Do you want to make love? You're absolutely beautiful, those eyes, that expression. You're absolutely the most sexy thing alive. Do you want to make love?
What happened?
Want me to breathe deeply?
She had a couple just like them. Right here near her belly button. You could push 'em around. I thought they were kinda sexy, myself.
Didn't seem worried about them.
I'm going to send you to the hospital to have a few X-rays taken. I want to find out exactly what you're hiding in there, OK? Give them this. The address is right there under Radiology.
But you'll think about what I said about working together, huh?
Yes?
He didn't make it.
Yeah? What do I do then?
NIGHT NIGHT
About Brad's family?
You got it!
Introduce yourselves.
Do you watch 'Dentonvale,' Janet?
SIN-I-FUL
Why Janet?
In my time they used to call me the Merlin of Berlin.
SPONSOR!!!
With Fast Food Farley at the helm it'll be TV dinners from now on.
Out of self comes selflessness.
Oh, Oliver, you're so tolerant. Time for a coffee before you rush off?
Oh.  Ah, I'm not calling at an inconvenient moment am I?
I'M LOOKING FOR LOVE
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR COMPASSION
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR IMPROVEMENT
Mental instability?
Could you tell us a little about it?
Oh my poor baby.
Poor Brad.
Hey!  What are you trying to do?  Get yourself committed?
I NEED SOME
No!  He's never done that before.
. . .For his own good.
Brad!
I FEEL THE HEAT FROM YOUR SKIN AND THE STUBBLE ON YOUR CHIN YOU'RE NO GOOD
So all in all it's going to be an exciting new series for us...
Nice technique there...  ...Cammi.
Really? Because I don't know, I was thinking that --
The problem with that is that then there's one extra --
Why are you being so defensive?
Miles.
I'm sorry, Miles. We did all we could. You've been a real trooper.  Tell him I'll call back.
When's that novel of yours coming out?  We  all want to read it.
You got it.
You look fabulous, Mrs. Raymond.
And what was that other one you did, the one where you're the jogger?
Hey, guys. How's it going?
Tastes good to me. You live around here, Stephanie?
I'm thinking about the duck breast.
What happened to you guys?
Are you a writer too?
I don't think so. We're celebrating Miles's book deal.
Why did you tell them my book was being published?
...and that one of the editors was passing it up to a senior editor. She was supposed to hear something this week, but now it's next week, and... It's always like this. It's always a fucking waiting game. I've been through it too many times already.
Just tell me.
And?
How about the new ending? Did you like that?
Fuck, man. Too early in the morning for that, you know what I mean?
That's your problem, Miles.
It'd be the best thing for you. You know what? I'm going to get you laid this week. That's going to be my best man gift to you. I'm not going to give you a pen knife or a gift certificate or any of that other horseshit.
Well, I say fuck that. You need to get your joint worked on, that's what you need.
Doesn't have to be now. Let's go taste.
Hey Jack, hurry up!
Christine's dad -- he's been talking about bringing me into his property business. Showing me the ropes. And that's something, considering how long it took him to get over I'm not Armenian. So I'm thinking about it. But I don't know, might get a little incestuous. But Mike does pretty well. A lot of high-end commercial stuff.
It does. Feels right.
Yeah. Tight.
Oh, yeah. That's Maya.
Doesn't mean shit. When Christine was a hostess at Sushi Roku, she wore a big engagement ring to keep guys from hitting on her. Think it worked? Fuck no. How do you think I met her?
Jesus, she's jammin'. And she likes you. What else do you know about her?
Ooooooohh. Now we're getting somewhere.
Somebody had to do the talking. And by the way, I was right. She's not married.
So what're we going to have? Pigs in a blanket? The "rancher's special breakfast"? Or maybe just some grease and fat with a side of lard?
Nice, huh?
She what?  When?
Get the trunk.
She called Maya, who's not working tonight, so we're all going out.
Stephanie, holy shit. Chick had it all going on.
And don't drink too much. I don't want you going to the dark side or passing out. Do you hear me? No going to the dark side.
Right now.
Where is Stephanie?
What the fuck are you doing?
Besides what?
Look who's talking. You've been there.
Here's what I'm thinking. We move up here, you and me, buy a vineyard. You design your own wine; I'll handle the business side. Then you get inspired and write a new novel. As for me, if an audition comes along, hell, LA'S two hours away. Not even.
Nice shot.
Is an abattoir like a... like a... what is that?
You ever actually read any of this guy's books?
So tell me everything. Details. I like details.
Did you have trouble performing? Yeah, that's...
No, I did not. Must have been Gary at the Hitching Post. I think we mentioned it to him the first night.
You sure you didn't say anything to Maya?
Ran. Twisted my ankle too.
No. She ordered them special. Took her forever to find them. They've got this design on them with dolphins and our names engraved in Sanskrit. We've got to go back. Christine'll fucking crucify me.
Cutting it a little close, don't you think?  So how was she? Compared to Stephanie, say.
Come on, let me drive.
What the fuck!
Hey, Miles. Good to see you.
I'm doing good, good. You look great. Did you lose some weight?
What are you drinking?
On a Sauvignon Blanc?
Hi.
The day you open a '61 Cheval Blanc, that's the special occasion.
Wow. We gotta give it a moment, but this is tasty. Really good. How about you?
You got kids?
I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.
Oh yeah. Who cares? I'm the queen of typos.  Wow, this is really starting to open up. What do you think?
You guys should stop by the restaurant for lunch today.
Hi. It's Maya. Please leave a message.
That was big of him.
Since the last time we spoke? I don't know. Could be better. Could be worse.
You quit drinking?
French or American?
Sir, what are you doing?
That was fun last night.
Yeah, well. You know, Jack's pretty eager to get up to... you know, but, uh, yeah. We'll see how it goes.
A hair.
Daddy.
I don't want you to die.
I'm scared.
Does it hurt?
Five. The five longest.
Chicken Teriyaki.
Should we turn off the lights?
He was only a year and half old.
How many died?
So the aliens can't read our minds.
Dr. Bimboo, one of the authors of the book --
They'll read our minds!
What's that?
It's not broken.
Second thing this week I can't explain.
Okay.  So he was tall?
I don't think so.
But I'll tell you something, what I said in their, still goes. You and your family have been through a lot in the last two days... Not to mention what happened to you all seven months ago.
I wouldn't do that. You're going to need every gun when that posse gets here.
I'd get down if I were you. They may be up there now.
If we charge them, they won't have a chance. But we gotta get to the horses.
All I did was kiss a girl.
So I did, I got out of there, I don't want no trouble. You know me.  So I walked out on the street and the fella tried to shoot me in the back.
Forget the money. You've got to get these people out of here. This is no place to be sitting with women and kids.
Where are we?
I almost didn't.
More than enough.
The Parkers seem like nice folks.
Paden sends his best.
I'm surprised to see you out here tonight.
You must have known that before you came.
I guess tomorrow at dawn he'll be proved right.
I've never been in there. They just jumped you out of the blue?
South of here, past Chimayo.
Doesn't look quite fair.
You'll have to deal me out on that. I've had some experience with that sort of thing, and I don't want any more.
C'mon, I'll buy you a drink.
You own this land.
Never will again.
A lot of men have told me that. Maybe it's true. I guess some women are slow to believe it.
Because they don't like what I want.
It was not -- it was Murdo's. Those McKendricks don't know how to act like human beings.
Where's your brother?
This a friend of yours?
Who is he?
Get out of here, Jake.
You wanted to see me?
Came to the wrong town. I don't tolerate this kind of thing. It's hard on the peace, and it's hard on the furniture. Now, knowing a bit about Carter here, I'm going to let you go without paying for the damages. But go you will, and I mean now.
The jury saw it differently.
I'm not sure, but I got an idea. And when I am sure, they're going to pay.
What about his brother?
Things are getting messy around here.  I hear Ezra Johnson got himself killed.
This is mighty sweet, Paden. I think I finally found my place in the world.
You got a place to stay?
Nothing like that will happen between us.
I'm going to have to look into this.
I never could count on you to be reasonable.  Don't force me to make an adjustment around here.
Nifty.
What is it that I can't figure?
It's an advance. We want him to know he's going to be happy here.
-- Forgive me, Mr. Taransky.  I'm just trying to understand.  All these films, TV appearances, magazine covers, internet interviews, publicity photos, snapshots from her childhood -- all fake.  This is fake, this is fake -- fake, fake, fake, all fake.
But not everyone's imaginary, are they, Mr. Taransky?  I refer, of course, to Edith.
Christ --  Elaine, I know how it looks but...  ... it would mean a lot to Viktor if you'd go with him to the Oscars. If you won't do it for him, please do it for me.
Thanks.  This is my exit so, I --
God, Viktor.  Why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself?
You realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
-- It's called a projector.
Listen, Viktor, I have good memories of those days too -- but this isn't about that or you or me or some high-minded ideal.  This is business.
I don't have it on me.  Anyway, it means a lot.  Have you read the reviews?  They're love letters.  Listen to this one.  "Simone has the voice of a young Jane Fonda, the body of Sophia Loren, the grace of, well, Grace Kelley, and the face of Audrey Hepburn combined with an angel".
I can't wait to meet her.
Really?  Oh, so she's really going to do all this nudity?
Al least a contingency for wardrobe.  Any woman can go up a dress size.
As I've tried to explain to you, Elaine.  Simone isn't like any other actress you've ever known. She's about the work and only the work -- lives for the work.  She wants all the money up there...  ... on the screen where it belongs. She'd work for scale except I know you only respect people you pay a fortune.
Not today.  She's learning her lines.  You can also take cue cards and teleprompter out of the budget.
Listen, Viktor... I want to talk to you now, not as Elaine, studio head, but Elaine, ex-wife.  Second ex-wife.  You got lucky this last time but you need to be careful.  We both know you wouldn't be making this overblown art film of you hadn't convinced Simone to be in it.
The premiere was the first time I've convinced her to venture out and it just confirmed her worst nightmares.
She was there.  She didn't by any chance happen to mention me?
-- Viktor, are you with her?  Is she there?
Yes, you do...  Anyway, tonight was a good start.
My two favorite girls.
Elaine, it's Wednesday.
About now.  Would you like a drink?
Is Simone back to earth yet?
Of course she will.  Her public will demand it.
Don't look so glum, Viktor.  It's not a death sentence.
Hello?
Let's go, Lainey.  There's nothing here.
Nudity has just never been an issue for me, Frank.  For me, clothes are just an option.
How will you do our love scenes?
Is she here?
You have to see her.
-- Flesh is weak.
Harry!  Harry!  Can we have a minute?  What brings you here tonight?
Me too.
Okay.  But you have to find a way to escape that thing.
How?
You do?  Still?  I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that.
Okay, Dad.
You know me -- married to my work.
-- Plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court.  It's the best deal you're going to get.
So they're probably here.  You might be able to sell this 'disappearing act' to the rest of the world, but I'm not buying it. What's really behind this Simone woman?  The public has a right to know.  Why is she staying out of sight?  And why the hell is she with you?  I don't want you to take this the wrong way, Viktor, but you're not exactly Cecil B. DeMille -- more run-of-the-mill.
Nice try.  If we can't get to her through you, maybe your family will be more co-operative.  I can guarantee you, Taransky, one way or another, Miss Simone and I are going to get acquainted.
Nice boat, Taransky.
I know what you're up to.
I know that's what you'd like us to believe.  But I got to tell you -- embezzlement is a serious matter. Not to mention abduction.
That doesn't prove a thing -- wait until I get a court order for a blood test.
Whatever it is, it's dark.
Of course -- no one's that perfect, that pure.  You know I had something on Mother Teresa.  But then she died and it wasn't worth it anymore.  I know how to flush out this Simone -- a tell-all story from her childhood.
Thank you.  It's not important.
Would you like me to read?
Yes, of course it is.  You know you have a line here.  Not a wrinkle.  Actually, more of a dimple.  I've been thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
You mean they buy it?
I am the death of real.
Your eye frames. They don't seem to have any lenses in them.
What was that you were saying before with your soldiers? Day pro fun.
No.
Everybody got upset. They had a meeting. Momma started crying.  I don't draw like that anymore.
Why?
Know what?
Your father ever tell you bedtime stories?
Once upon a time there was a prince, who was being driven around... He drove around for a long, long time... Driving and driving... It was a long trip... He fell asleep...  When he woke up, they were still driving... The long drive went on--
Dead people, like in graves and coffins?
...No.
Cats?
Can I ask you then?
You weren't a paper champion.
I believe both of you now.  And I think I might know how to make them go away.
She came a long way to visit me, didn't she?
You didn't take it before. You didn't take it the time after that. And now, you didn't take it again?
There's only two of us.  Maybe someone came in our house -- took the bumble bee pendant out of my closet, and then laid it nicely in your drawer?  Is that what happened?
I'd give anything to have been there.
Someone got hurt.
A lady. She died.
You can see her?
Where is she?
Cole, you're scaring me.
They?
Yes, Cole?
Cole, this was a legal courthouse. Laws were passed here. Some of the first laws of this country. This building was full of lawyers. Lawmakers.
I don't like people looking at me like that.
What--
The last time was a Chuck E. Cheese party a year ago. He hid in one of those purple plastic tunnels and didn't come out.
I work at an insurance place and at Penny's, so Cole can go to that good school.
You ever hear of... the harvest of blood?
Your grandfather sure believed in it. Worked pretty good... too.
Yo. "Billy Bob". Was I two beats behind, or what?
Fuck you! If you're such an expert on music, why don't you go get your dueling banjo and sit in on the next song?
Okay, Farm Boy. Joke's over. You've been playin' me from jump street. Where's my Nikes?
Witch.
Hey! Don't use all the hot water!
There's something weird going on here, Suzie.
I'm serious. Get this. I had a careful look at that alternator. It's clearly been messed with... it's not wear and tear that caused that breakdown...
Come on --
Gene.
That's not patricide. Patricide is when you gun down your old man.
I'll be gone again tomorrow.
How... was she "called?"
Think boy. That night. The night of the fire. At the barn. You were only six years old.
It's a farm, Keith. You're not supposed to shoot the rooster.
You seen Mac? His bed hasn't been slept in.
Shit!
What about Jeremiah?
No --
Get out of here.
I almost thought for a second...
Yeah. Great work, Rod. But next time, it would be nice... if you could JOIN US FOR THE ENTIRE SET!
Where's Mac?
Bill, you're Chief of police now.
Shit.
Bill, this Brenda's Randy Flagg's niece. We need to find Grant yesterday! The town council has lit a Roman candle and stuck it up my ass!
What?
There's a place over there on the bluffs. When the fog is just right, like tonight, the lights of Main look like a kaleidoscope.
Please, Bill. What happened, it's my fault, I know it.
No reception out here.
Grant used to get filled up every day. I knew it was just to see me. He was too old -- But he was handsome. And he had that big ol' Lincoln then. I flirted with him.
What?
And then we get here, the Castavets', where last night's shit--storm took place.
When I buy my zoo, I'm leaving them things the hell out!
Looks like a chipmunk.
Slugs? No. 'Less you talkin' about that new waitress down at Sloan's! Ha ha!
Megan Halesy' little sister.
Who's the lucky fella?
You're lookin' awful pretty.
Meat.
Thinkin' 'bout getting me a couple of these big ol' rib eyes.
Hell, what am I holding back for? Why don't you just give me everything you got here?
I loved you. I loved --
He took him over. His body. His -- his brain, everything what he knew. He's only been dumb stuff before amoeba--things, and rhino--things. He liked being human. Didn't want to change.
So he drags the cow backwards here. Only he prolly didn't know 'bout the Castavets had them dogs.
Maybe you better sit back down. You don't look so good.
Just the man who's gonna see you driven to your knees! Sheriff Buell Clayton from Texas.
Get your hands off my daughter!
You're crazy, man. Smart dresser, but crazy.
I got a boy running in the Peach Tree Classic tomorrow and when he wins, I wanna celebrate in style.
You got my barley pop?
Why're you driving so fast?
An existentialist.
So tell me about yourself.
Driving, talking to me...
Where you from?
That's a Texas cop. What the hell's he doing in Arkansas?
You know, my mother was a dancer, too. Her big shot was the touring company of 'Brigadoon.' She's been married three times. To a redneck, a poet and her tennis instructor.  See, I motor-mouth when I get nervous. I was nervous when I first got into the car. Now I'm scared shitless.
Your honeymoon would've never been this exciting.
Christ, what channel are we on?...
You know this guy, don't you?
Look, the truth is, I didn't want to be dumped at the truck stop. I wanted to go on with you. I needed an excuse.
What kind of a guy is he?
What do you want me to do, Hot Pants? Beg?
Order up!
Cledus.
Why are we doing this?
I hate to say I told you so.
This is Bandit II. Now, where the hell are you?
My vocal cords are fine, but Fred's ain't. He's been barking, eating the seats and driving me crackers.  Hear that? Where's his chow?
I thought you were dumping the chick at the truck stop.
-- Looks like a clear shot to the 'Bama State Line.
Bandit II?
You're coming up to the scale house.
Bandit I, let me offer my heartiest congratulations and a piece of advice.
Bandit, I just thought I'd lay a Smokey report on you.
My handle's Silver Tongued Devil and I'm here to tell you, your fellow CB'ers are mighty proud of y'all.
Breaker, Breaker. This is Bandit I, coming up on a portable gas station. Do you copy?
Pop, a K-Whopper's worth seventy thou.
Uh-uh. What Cobra?
Yeah, Bandit II, Que pasa?
Bandit two, you read me?
Why don't we just rent a Lear jet and haul it back ourselves?
It's gotta be tough keeping an eye on everything.
But with these down, doesn't that pose a major security concern if, as you say, you have to keep an eye on everything at all times?
Maybe he's that good. Never been caught, no criminal record.
He's giving them up?
No.
Who?
You're sure?
And when you saw him later, he was wearing one of your security jackets --
You investigating those murders out at the lake?
I did. We -- yeah, I know.
...I forgive you Darwin.
-- Jack, what am I doing? I'm standing here, aren't I?  Shouldn't that be enough? That I made the trip?
Jesus Hugo! How is it that you can turn a simple conversation into a fucking hedge maze!? This is zero degree of difficulty man!
I could have it sent out...
Do you want me to say I did it?
Do you want me to say I'm sorry?
...I'm sorry...
Answer your fucking pages! I've been calling for fifteen minutes, we need you up here to clean NOW!
Sparazza is rumored to have performed in excess of one-hundred and thirty contract murders, including one of the bureau's most celebrated agents. Freeman Heller. You heard of "The Turnpike Murders" that was Sparazza.
So the wiretaps we conducted on Serna and Padiche, the mention of Israel's heart?
On an extradition flight back to El Salvador, he murdered a security detachment and vanished.
Here. Sit.   Please.
...Does he know?
Y'gotta, y'gotta. But d'ya think they'll kick ransom for that little prick, assuming we get to'm.
... Jesus... what for?
Wow.
No shit.
Well, I'm hearin' the Swede's been dispatched, he's flying so --
I feel like I know you girl. I feel like I've known you forever.  You gonna lemme see your scars?
You got the fifty up? Bitch y'tryin' t'take down a jumbo jet? Blown the moon out the sky? T'fuck you wanna get that grimy?
-- It's your IFB, somebody else has got an earpiece, you're picking up their signal --
...Shhhhhhit... girl, there's these two dudes, just sittin' here in this elevator, all shot up...
Girl one of these fools has an FBI badge on him! Is this the one that was doing the inspection?
Bulllllshit...
And so I get this straight, we gotta go in, bust on this punk and remove the heart? Is that for real?
You think you're dreaming me, like you dream her.  Understand something: I am the real Gibarian.  Just a new incarnation.
Why would you let her to do that?
It's changing characteristics.  It's solidifying taking on weight.
Where's Snow?  Did you call him?
What's wrong?  What happened to Gibarian?
In his lab.  He won't let you in.
Gibarian warned me.  He left me a message.
Tell me.  I won't think you're insane.
It started about three months ago. Right after the government sold the expedition.  We were ready to go home.
Probably.
If God is beyond our comprehension, and she --  -- is here for reasons that can't be understood, isn't God here?
Why do you think she hasn't suggested that?  It's the most obvious solution: Escape.  She knows she can't leave here --
I don't know.  I can't be alone.
"And Death Shall Have No Dominion".
I wasn't.
You want to fuck her?
You go home.
What do you remember?
Then it's God, right?
What happened to us, exactly?
Sartorius wants to destroy it.
You feel sorry for Solaris, or for me?
You don't want me.
What's wrong?
Please don't lie.  I told you before, I don't know how I came to be here. Whatever you think you can't say to me, I need to hear you say it.
I'm not Rheya.  You've always known that.
No.
Chris, I had to.  I had to.  I didn't think you'd react like this.
That's impossible.  I'm not Rheya.
What does it want?
Last night.  You were talking to someone in the corridor.
You want it coming back with us?
And so what's with Steinhart?  Is it serious?
Occasionally.
I've never seen anyone killed before.
I'm supposed to call in.
You can touch me, I won't bite.
Let's get a drink.
I'll have a spritzer, order something soft for yourself... I must go for a pee.
You wouldn't happen to know what language they speak in India, do you?
Didn't do very well, did you?
Yeah.
You asked.
Where?
What a memory.
They guys treatin' you all right?
I've been doing a lot of thinking.
How long you going away for?
"For"...?
You still going away?
Okay?
I'd identify him.
What did she say the down payment was?
What's wrong with your paisley tie?
I know you're her bodyguard.  Did she buy it or did you?
Did you hear what I said?
What was that?
You gotta get another tour.  We're gettin' too old for this.
Hey, we qualify for the Senior Citizens Early-Bird Special... Did you see Tommy today?  He misses you...
What about when she identifies him?!
What do you think?  Any chance?  There's nothin' else I'm any good at, but this.
Let's go.  We're takin' her home!  Move it!  Get the cars!
Who's Joey Venza?
How do I know that's her?
What're we having?
Nice threads Dad.
How are things going, pal?
What "plans?"  You and Mom got "plans?"
You coming in?
Tommy!  The guy's a sleaze-bag.  She can't sing.
And Flash isn't?
What, want a glass?
Ya still follow the Mets, Pete?
Now tell me you love me.
Yeah--
Relax, Jameson.  This is business. I know you want photos of me, so I'll give your boy Parker an exclusive.  On one condition--
Oh, that?  It'll come unstuck in a half-hour or so. Your mouth needs the rest.  Bye.
No refund on the mask, y'know. Health laws.
You're making my life difficult.
Is that bug juice, or are you just glad to see me?
No.  I was lying about the coffee.
He'll weasel out of trouble. Again.
You should write that one down.
Eat alone, gotta read. Social defense tactic 17  Peter, that jacket is foul.  Lose your glasses?
They keep saying there's nothing I could've done.  That's a lie.  I could've done something.  If only I'd paid attention to my feelings.
You'd feel what?
Hello, Liz.
Roz? Rosomoff?  What is it?
When I moved out, you swore up and down you wouldn't meddle--
What the hell is that?
Oh, not that.  You promised you'd burn it.
Poison emergency.
Do ya? Lemme give you the number for Bellevue.  That's 561-5151--
That Nobel Prize will just have to wait.
A bit melodramatic but if you could prove it that would tie in your unified field theory, the Big Bang, Kaluza-Klein--
Life and death matter. Yours-- everyone's.  By comparison, our search for truth is only a product of curiosity, a game--
Mr. Parker.
Your dog ate it.
Really.  I'd like to speak with him.
You never know.  Go get some sleep.
Mr. Reiss-- I need a quarter--
Loonytunes.  And yet...
Do you... live around here?
I see.  Well, Octavius won't get much further. They'll catch him and... put him away.  Sad.  He might very well have the truth.
Spider-Man, be careful!  He's quite mad.
What's wrong with him?
Jawohl.
We made a deal with Barrack One.
Do Cagney. Like you did yesterday.
I had to be the ham! I had to shoot off my mouth!
Ready?
Three's a crowd, especially if you've got to cut your way through barbed wire.  Here's the wire cutters.  Are the civilian clothes ready?
There's only one pair left.
That's not the point, Cookie. The point is what do you do with him? You tip your mitt and the Jerries pull him out of here and plant him someplace else, like Stalag Sixteen or Fifteen. Or you kill him off and the Krauts turn around and kill off the whole barracks. Every one of us. So what do you do?
So long, Cookie. The department store is all yours. What's left of it.
You make my mouth water.
Come again?
That's the general idea.  Only it's not so general as far as I'm concerned.
Maybe he would. We applied for Officers' Training together, remember? They turned me down, but I'm glad to see you made it. Of course, it couldn't be that all that dough behind you had something to do with it!  His mother's got twenty million dollars.
What did you expect, glamor boy? The Officers' Club with a steam room and a massage maybe?
Shut off the moaning, or we'll have the dogs on us. Shut it off, Lieutenant. This is orders!
What did you expect, a St. Bernard dog?
What some brandy?
Whatever it is, it's out of your jurisdiction. This man is not a prisoner of war. Not any more. He is a saboteur.
Aufstehen, gentlemen! Please! You do not want to stay in bed on such a beautiful morning we are having today!
Why don't we accept, Animal? The worst that can happen is we wind up a couple of lamp shades.
When you get going on those broads, think of me!
Coffee? Milk? Or how about a little cocoa?
Hey -- Russki -- Russki! Look at those bublichkis! Over here!
Look at me! I'm your baby!  Get a load of that blonde one! Built like a brick Kremlin!
It's chow, Animal! Chow!
No you don't! You don't want any broads with boots on!
If she don't want you, she don't get anything.
Schnickelfritz! I told you Schnickelfritz! Why'd you make me bet on Equipoise!
Look at her! Isn't she beautiful! Married an orchestra leader!
How? Pinky Miller from Barrack 8 tried to get over there and they shot him in the leg!
You did?
What do those broads say?
Do Grable.
May I have this dance, Miss?
Cut the horseplay, Harry. What's the matter with you guys?
What are you going to do?
What do you say, Hoffy. We'll hit the air raid trenches and cut out in back of Barracks nine.
Sometimes I think he is fooling us with that crazy business.
What's the matter, boys? Is my slip showing?
You heard that, Sefton?
Who did?
What are we going to do with him?
Now you've done it. You've given me nervous indigestion.  Anything else bothering you, boys?
And what's that crack supposed to mean?
When the Krauts find that gadget they'll throw us all in the boob.
So was the radio private property. So was Manfredi and Johnson.
Or how about a game of pinochle? No, you're not a pinochle man. You're a chess player.  I haven't played since I was a kid. Let's see --  -- a pawn moves this way, doesn't it? And a bishop this way? And the queen -- every which way, doesn't it?
I thought that's what you said. You're from Cleveland. And you were with the Thirty-sixth Bomb Group?
I'll kill you for that!
December seventh, forty-one.
Wie hat er's gemacht?
Du lieber Gott! How do you look? You had a fight?
Three hundred cigarettes! What is it you want from me?
All right, gentlemen! We will now all go outside for a little gymnastic and take some shovels and undig the tunnel which you digged.
Gentlemen, tomorrow morning the Geneva Man is coming to inspect the camp whether we are living up to the International Convention. I am sure he will find we are treating you very well. You must not run around in your underwear. And take off the wash. The Kommandant wants all the barracks to be spic and also span.
From a chicken, bug-wit.
Is it all right if we smell it?
You must have been some tail gunner!  Go ahead, Cookie.
Have a nice time over there?
I thought he was the Chief Engineer.
What do you mean?
No. And what you must try to avoid is becoming consumed by another emotion which I believe you're beginning to experience: guilt.
This is its current position.
Courage is an emotion too, Data.  Now, can you project the course of the ribbon?
Population?
Data, you're not thinking about using that thing are you?
I get it. I get it.
That's it, Bridge- we're all out!
Sensors show five life signs aboard the station, Captain.
I have rerouted auxiliary power to the lateral thrusters- attempting to level our descent.
Do you remember him?
That ribbon isn't just some random energy phenomenon travelling through space. It's a doorway. It leads to another place- the Nexus. It doesn't exist in our universe and it doesn't play by the same rules either.
It took a long time, but eventually I learned to live with it. And I began to realize that my experience in the Nexus had changed me.  I knew things about people, about events, about time.
Soran may still be obsessed with getting back. And if he is, he'll do anything to find that doorway again.
Soran?
Where is he now?
I'm Captain John Harriman. I'd like to welcome you all aboard.
Prepare to leave spacedock. Aft thrusters ahead one quarter, port and starboard at station keeping.  Captain Kirk, I'd be honored if you would give the order to get underway.
Beautiful day, isn't it?
Antonia?
Close to retirement?
You know, Scotty, it amazes me.
But I do have a theory...
Let's try to move beyond the usual prisoner-interrogator banter, shall we? You have information and I need it.  Did the Captain explain his orders to you? Did he say why you were searching for trilithium?
Sir?
There's still no indication of why they attacked the station?
Is there a problem?
I'm afraid I can't just leave it at that. The commanding officer of this ship is clearly distraught about something. As ship's counselor, it's my duty to-
Well, with all due respect to your Betazoid senses, I prefer to be alone right now.
Doctor, we're still conducting an investigation into the attack. Once we've completed our work, we'll be happy to allow you and your fellow scientists back aboard the observatory. Until then-
Worf, prepare a spread of photon torpedoes. We'll have to hit them the instant they begin to cloak.
Tractor beam, aye!
Transwarp at your command, Sir!
Will we get another ship?
Unit two, this is One. The Kobayashi Maru has set sail for the promised land. Acknowledge.
Calm yourself, Bones.
Admiral, there is no response from the Grissom on any channel.
Still no response, sir.
I'd swear something was there sir, but I might have imagined it.
Aye sir, coding now.
I don't believe it...
All right -- get your gear. I'll put you down next time around.
Sector two... Indicating desert terrain. Minimal vegetation, temperature thirty-nine point four.
Same sector. Metallic mass.
.          .. Spock's tube...
Later. Let's go...
Saavik... My god, what happened to them?
You mean, we're stranded down here?!
This planet is aging in surges.
Grissom to landing party. We have you approaching radioactive indications. Do you concur?
Very well. Exercise caution, Lieutenant. This landing is Captain's discretion and I'm the one who's out on a limb.
Ah, Saavik, that's, ah, extroadinary. What would you, ah, like to do next?
As promised, she's all yours, sir. All systems automated and ready. A chimpanzee and two trainees could run her.
What's wrong?
The Genesis planet is gone.
... Admiral, what's going to happen to Enterprise?
The word, sir?
If I read this right, sir, we have full power.
Standby automatic approach system ... Advise approach control.
Will you be able to handle that...?
You're right.  Thanks for the drink.
Do not lecture me about treaty violations. The Federation, in creating an ultimate weapon, has become a gang of Intergalactic criminals. It is not I who will surrender, it is you.  On the planet below, I have three prisoners from the team who developed your doomsday weapon. If you do not surrender immediately, I will execute them, one at a time, as enemies of galactic peace.
Wait! Give me a chance --
Commander, Klingon vessel. Stand by to board this ship on my next signal.
Maltz. Prisoners are at beam coordinates. Standby...
Genesis, I want it.
Yes. Exhilarating, isn't it!
Then you know how bravely your son met his death.
I -- saw no future --
... Or the one.
Please wait!... Surely he would have found a way! If there was so much at stake -- Spock would have found a way!
Bones!...
Sir, may I suggest --
I ordered no interruptions.
Why haven't they finished us?... They outgun me ten to one; they have four hundred in crew to my handful, yet they sit there.
My Lord... what are your orders?
Not anymore! Now you can do both at the same time! According to myth, the earth was created in six days. Watch out: here comes Genesis; we'll do it for you in six minutes --
Are you out of your Vulcan mind? No human can tolerate the radiation loose in there!
Physician, heal thyself.
I'm almost afraid to. What did you bring me, contraband Klingon --
Cheers. Bones, these are... charming.
Say thank you.
Damn it, Jim, what the hell's the matter? Other people have birthdays. Why're we treating yours like a funeral?
What DO you want? Damn it, why isn't there a girl here? You know this has nothing to do with age. This is about you flying a goddamn computer console when you wanna be out hopping Galaxies.
Doctors lose patients sometimes. Damn. I'm <u>still</u> in the dark: How'd he know about Genesis?
They even killed the galley chief.
You okay, Jim? How do you feel?
This is completely improper, Commander Chekov. I have no intention of allowing Reliant or any other unauthorized personnel access to our work or materials.
David was right, wasn't he? It's just to keep them busy.
You did this -- in a day?!
Does that about do it?
David. Please.
Are you sure these are the coordinates?
<u>Botany Bay</u> -- oh no!
But the child --
He left us.  We were no longer of use. SAAVIK Where is  the Reliant crew? Dead?
You lie! On Ceti Alpha V there was life, a fair chance to --
To Doctor Marcus, the civilian director of the experiments on Space Laboratory Regula I.
Why didn't you tell me?
He's on a build up to detonation!
We encoded four minutes --
I suppose I was.  I poured a drink. Would you like it?
I didn't expect anything.
I'm trying, David.
I was wrong about you. And <u>I'm</u> sorry.
Let go -- he can't -- !
Don't you believe it.
-- But I wanted you to know first who it was who had beaten you: I, Khan Noonian Singh, the eagle you attempted to cage forever.
Give me some time to recall the data on our computers --
Khan, how do I know you'll keep your word?
Captain... We're waiting. What's the delay?
Midshipman, you're a tiger.
Every young boy's fancy. I seem to remember it myself.  Very well. Mr. Scott, are your engines capable of handling a minor training cruise?
Mr. Scott, the word is given.
No, sir! You'll flood the whole compartment...!
If he hadn't, we'd be space by now.
And who is this?
Is the word given?
I assume you are loitering here to learn what efficiency rating I plan to give your cadets.
So you said at the time. Speaking of which, your protg's first rare -- a trifle emotional --
I know of your fondness for antiques.
You are going to remind me that logic alone dictates your actions.
Carol Marcus --
It literally is Genesis...
Their coil emissions are normal... Wait: their shields are going up. They're locking phasers -- !
That's it?
Admiral, they're reducing speed.
May I speak, sir?
I failed to resolve the situation.
Reliant's command...
Are you asking me if we are playing out that scenario now, Lieutenant?
After you dismiss the company, you will take the watch. Set course for Ceti Alpha V and we'll pick up survivors.
Yes, well, why don't you show him around and...
Approaching Regula and Space Lab Regula I.
Admiral on the bridge --
Phaser lock inoperative, sir.
May I remind the Captain that if a Starship enters the zone --
Prepare for warp speed.
He's not what I expected, Sir.
Certainly...
As you wish, since you deem them of value. But I cannot wait here to find them.
Humans make illogical decisions...
How're you doing?
Sorry if I spoke out of turn.
You sure this is such a bright idea?
Bones --
It doesn't look all that different.
Hi... Busy?
Spock, it's me, Bones! I mean our experience was unique. You really have gone where no man has gone before. Can't you tell me what it felt like?
You're joking...!
Most unusual. An unknown form of energy of great intelligence and power. I find it illogical that its intentions are hostile...
Specifically, Humpback Whales.
Guess, Spock. Your best guess.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
A simple evacuation of the expanding epidural hematoma will relieve the pressure.
... It gives me a great sense of history.
All right, Commander, you wanna tell us anything?
Yes, sir.
Ah, well done, team 2.
To hunt a species to extinction is not logical.
They like you very much. But they are not the hell your whales.
You mean man...
There's really very little point in my trying to explain.
Can I ask <u>you</u> something?
They're gonna hafta take their chances.
He's just going to hang around the bushes while we eat?
How will that be done, exactly?
... Who are you?
I'm all ears.
Jesus, you are persistent.  Okay, your friend was right. Gracie is not only pregnant, she is very pregnant... At noon tomorrow -- in what is sure to be a media circus -- the whales get shipped out.
It's all real. Look.  The storage tanks for the whales.
... Gone?!
All I need is the radio frequency to track them.
I belong here.  Suppose by some miracle you do get them through.  Who in the 23rd Century knows anything about Humpback whales?
Hey! -- Where you going?!
You mean this is -- goodbye?
Thank you, Admiral.
Spock -- you're suggesting the transmission is meant for life form other than man?
Spock, could the Humpback's answer to this call be simulated?
That leaves us no choice. We must destroy the probe before it destroys Earth.
Home in on the strongest signal. Descend from orbit.
Weren't those a birthday present from Dr. McCoy?
Oh, the complete works of Jacqueline Susan, the novels of Harold Robbins....
That's cutting it closer than you know. What about team two?
Damn.... Damnit! We've been so lucky. We have the two perfect whales in our hands, but if we don't move quickly, we'll lose them!
Mr. Sulu...? ... Mr. Sulu?!
Any luck...?
Bearing!
Mr. Scott, how soon can we get underway?
We're ready, sir. I've converted the Dilithium Sequencer to something less primitive. And Admiral -- I've replaced the Klingon Food Packs. They was givin' me sour stomach.
That should be enough. Can you enclose it to hold water?
You'll work it out, Scotty. And remember: two of them.
I'm ready Spock. Let's go find George and Gracie...
Ironic. When man was killing these creatures, he was destroying his own future...
Go on ahead... Close the hatch!
Admiral, I'd like to continue my work on the ship until you leave.
Even as the Federation negotiated a peace treaty with us, Kirk was secretly developing the Genesis torpedo! Conceived by Kirk's son and test detonated by the Admiral himself!  The result of this awesome energy was euphemistically called "The Genesis Planet..." A secret base from which to launch the. annihilation of the Klingon people!  We demand the extradition of Kirk! We demand justice!
Doctor Nichols, I might have something to offer <u>you</u>.
Father...?
Yes, of course... Do you have any message for your mother?
Ah, sorenara mazu mazu nagaiki wo sareru to mira.  Ah... Then I am sure that you will have a long and happy life.
I understand how you feel. We just want to retrace Data's movements that day...
Most of my people who live that faster pace would sell their souls to slow it down.
There are days.
An apprentice for thirty years.  We've noticed your people's mental discipline. Did that develop here?
There's one thing I don't understand.  In three hundred years...you never learned to swim?
When we're forced away by the terrain, we'll use transport inhibitors to compensate. The mountains have the highest concentrations. Once we're there, transport will be virtually impossible...
There's a cavern at the base of the next hill...
There is no need for concern. I am operating within normal parameters now.
My father told me I shouldn't talk to you.
Do machines ever play?
To many offlanders, what you have here would be more valuable than gold-pressed latinum.  And I'm afraid it's the reason that someone is trying to take this world away from you.
She's stabilizing.
Incomplete, I might add.
Your Federation procedures have made this mission ten times as difficult as it needed to be...
Take us into a high orbit.  Lie down, Admiral. The girls will take twenty years off your face...
Your android has turned dangerously violent, Captain... Considerable damage was done to my ship. He must be destroyed.
It isn't safe for you to remain in this area.
Take me down. Let me talk to Picard.
You're not going to launch anything until...
I wish I had better news. Commander Data attacked us in the mission scout ship yesterday. Ru'afo and I have decided to send in an assault team...
... and because they have warp capabilities, the consequences to their society are minimal...
In stasis. La Forge is completing the diagnostic.
The concentration in the rings is what makes the whole damned thing work. Don't ask me to explain it. I only know they inject something into the rings that starts a thermolytic reaction. After it's over, the planet will be unlivable for generations.
I wonder... which one of us will be facing that court-martial...
What you're asking me to do... is impossible... the crew is loyal to Ru'afo...
But I would need at least three minutes on the bridge.
Separate the Starfleet personnel and secure them in the aft cargo hold... see that Picard joins them...
I don't believe it happened that way.
Funniest thing, Captain. There wasn't anything wrong with my implants. There was something right with my eyes. When Doctor Crusher removed the ocular connections, she found the cells around my optic nerves...
A photon torpedo.  Isn't that the universal greeting when communications are down?
The tear is closing on us... impact in fifteen seconds...
Commander, I'm showing two Son'a ships on an intercept course.
The Diplomatic Corps is busy with Dominion negotiations.
... and gorgonzolla cheese.
Deck five.
Captain...
I've already modified a tricorder with one of his spare actuation servos. Its operational range is only seven meters but it should shut him down...
Sir, if we fire a tachyon burst, it may force him to reset his shield harmonics. When he does, we could beam him out...
Debrief them again.  Have you been in a fight, Commander?
Doctor Crusher asked to talk to you when you returned...
Should I distribute phasers to the Ba'ku, sir...?
Isolinear tags. Their transporters can lock onto them.
Wine, women and song.
Nomadic, collectors of precious metals, jewels...
What you're doing to my neck...
Go where? Hello? Is anyone going to tell me what we're doing here?
It's not the radiation... and there's nothing wrong with the combadges... the Enterprise just isn't responding.
Are you saying they won't help us?
He's stable... for now.  But it would be better if we could contact... our friends.
But I had a little help. Surgical transporter. I used it to beam out most of the bone fragments from his brain.
There is a perimeter alert. A ship has entered sensor range.
Mister Data, I want to know the exact date and time.  Give me a damage report on that missile silo.
But now... they are all one with the Borg.
Captain, I'm starting to worry about the hull integrity. We've been running the support field at full power for three hours straight. I don't know how much longer it's going to hold up.
I'm having trouble scanning underground. There's a lot of radiation leaking from something.
I'm picking up faint life signs twenty meters below.
Alphanumeric lock. We need a password to get in...
Blast door. It's designed to protect the control room when the missile is launched.
Yeah... if I knew what it looked like. There's probably five hundred ways to design a valve like this...
What's still there?
Ready to deploy the warp nacelles.
Captain, the Enterprise!
Their com system must still be down.
They're getting awfully close... what the hell are they doing?
Are we on schedule? The Vulcan ship will be here in less than two hours.
ATR setting...
Jean-Luc Picard.
Yes.
Beautiful city. Used to be, anyway. I didn't think anyone still lived there.
That was a pretty clever trick you did with the hospital's batteries. How'd you do it?
Take care of him. He's a very special man.
Did you need something?
"Money." So you can get dome money...
No... but sometimes I feel that way.  What I meant was, I'd be willing to trade for the photographs.
Ruby... I need to talk to you about those photographs. It's very important.
Where? And don't tell me San Francisco...
Signal the Endeavor to fall back. We'll cover them.
Captain...?
Captain, I've found the Borg Sphere. It's on the far side of the planet...firing at the surface.
Casualties are light, Captain. Minor buckling on the port nacelle. Nothing serious.
What are they doing?
They're connecting the conduits to subspace communications...
Worf! I'm going to need at least five minutes!
Report!
All right... we've lost control of eight decks... three Cargo Bays... one Shuttlebay.
To do what? If they wanted a weapon, they could've taken over a phaser bank or torpedo bay...
Worf to Bridge. We're about to enter the Environmental Control Room.
No response.  I'm not reading any Starfleet com traffic in this entire sector.
Are we in any danger of being detected by Earth defense systems?
Mr. President we cannot allow Federation citizens to be abducted.
I'd prefer not to be the President to push the button if I can avoid it.
Good luck, Captain.
I'm going to perform surgery on a torpedo - you never know...
Or not to be -
Specifically of...?
Well, don't be too hard on yourself - we all felt exactly the same -
What kind of creature is this? Last night you two were spooning -
Captain, when we get to Camp Khitomer, how will we defend ourselves? I mean, if this new Bird of Prey can fire while she is invisible...?
Too bad we can't SMELL her.
It takes a lot of effort.
He's a DOCTOR!
And now we come to the architect of this tragic affair, Captain James Tiberius Kirk. I put it to you, Captain, that you were seeking revenge for the death of your son.
You deny that your men beamed aboard KRONOS One and shot the Chancellor?
As Captain I am responsible for the conduct of the crew under my command.
Just the size of my head -
Captain, if they fire at us with our shields down --
They're preparing to fire.
Your friends are late...
What took you so long?
How did you know...?
That's not his knee.  Not everybody keeps their genitals in the same place, Captain.
Getting outside the shield is easy. After that it's up to you to get us off the surface before we freeze. Can you?
This is incredible -
As you were. Lieutenant...?
Aft thrusters -
Sorry -
Saavik, you know anything about a neutron energy surge?
The Conference is at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border. I'm sending the exact coordinates on a coded frequency.
DON'T TRUST THEM. DON'T BELIEVE THEM -
What the -
We HAVEN'T fired -
Can we two have grown so old and inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness?  Would that constitute a joke?
But I am not human. I am only -
What's she waiting for?
Captain, we can't see her, but she gives off heat...
Any reply from Starfleet to our dispatch, Lieutenant.
Curious. You haven't been assisting Commander Uhura with her radio transmissions, have you, Lt?
If you are logical.
But it was when you tried to persuade me the Captain was guilty that I should have understood.
Perhaps neither of us was hearing very well that night, Lieutenant. There were things I tried to tell you too - about having faith.
Direct hit -
Don't tell me that was any meteor shower.
I have confirmed the location, sir, but...
NO WAY!
A computer canna lie, sir.
A Bird of Prey canna fire when she's cloaked!
They you're talking about a dreadful new engine of destruction, Mr. Spock.
They're outside the beaming shield. Mr. Scott, start your engines.
I don't think Starfleet could have envisioned our current predicament.
They might as well arrest me, too; I felt like Lieutenant Saavik.
Fuzzy face is gone.
Do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship?
I notice Dr. Crusher laughing along with the rest of you. As most of you know, the doctor will also soon be leaving the Enterprise, to assume command of Starfleet Medical. Again, I'm forced to ask, Beverly, have you considered what you're doing to little ole me?! I'll probably get some old battle-axe of a doctor who'll tell me to eat my vegetables and put me on report if I dont show up for my physical on time!
When was he... created?
I so wanted to believe Shinzon. But the Thalaron radiation can't be explained away. Whatever he's after, it's not peace.
As a result the temporal sequencing was never activated. Remember, he was supposed to replace you at nearly your current age. He was engineered to skip thirty years of life. But since the RNA sequencing was never activated, his cellular structure has started to break down. He's dying.
To seek out new life and new civilizations. Zephyr. Cochrans own words. When Charles Darwin set out on the H.M.S. Beagle, on his journey into the unknown... he sailed without a single musket.
That is because you have a familiarity with them. You can predict specific reactions and behavior and are comfortable in that knowledge.
The final signature is approx- imately 300 meters up that incline.
Data!
Ready, Captain.
"For now we see but through a glass darkly..." He said he's a mirror.
But so much is the same. On a biological level he is... and I will not accept the idea that there is nothing I can do. I have a responsibility to try to make a human connection with him.
He may have already rejected my humanity, but you also have a twin
How can you be sure?
Yes, sir. The Rift effects all long-range communications.
At present he serves no useful function. Dr. Soong created us to become active and useful members of society. I do not believe he would have wanted the B-9 to live out his life in his present state.
What purpose does this serve?
Dr. Soong must have found it unnecessary in later versions.
But I believe he will prove incapable of performing higher functions.
If you wouldn't mind.
Counselor.
It's about Data  I've watched him with the B-9 and I'm troubled. Data's desire for a "family" is very strong. I'm afraid he may be investing too much in the B-9.
I'm going to miss you.
How can you be certain?
The one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle: me.
But how can he? He'll kill you.
The Empire considers this a matter of internal security. We regret you've become involved.
Open a channel.
It's very faint but I've isolated it to the third planet in the Kolarin system.
Cannon fodder.
That's what I don't get -- it's mostly basic stellar cartography: star charts; communications protocols; some uplinks from colony tracking stations. It's not even restricted material.
I thought Thalaron radiation was theoretical.
What's he doing?
How long until he can fire?
Prepare for a site-to-site transport.
Geordi... prepare the shuttle- bay for arrivals. They don't know our procedures so just... open the doors.
New Praetor?

Worf, prepare a full phaser spread, zero elevation. All banks on my mark. Scan for shield impacts and stand by photon torpedoes.
What's this?
Captain, I hope I don't have to remind you --
She's not out for a pleasure cruise.
He wasn't designed to live a complete, human life span.
Counselor Troi, report to the bridge.
But she's not the Enterprise.
And you're not as we imagined you.
Were we always explorers?
If there's one ideal the Federation holds most dear it's that all men, all races, can be united. From the first time the Vulcans came to Earth we've sought a future of peace. Nothing would make me more proud than to take your hand in friend- ship. In time. When trust has been earned.
Oh, but it does.  We will no longer bow like slaves before anyone. Not the Romulans and not your mighty Federation. We're a race bred for war. For conquest.
It amazes me how little you know yourself.
You can't trace my holographic emitters, Captainn. So don't bother. And you can't contact Starfleet. We're quite alone.
To accept your surrender. I can clearly destroy you at any time. Lower your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship.
Not so long.
Report!
My God...
Intruder alert!
Are we prepared?
It's accelerating. You have no more time for games.
And?
Then perhaps you will enlight- en us?
I thought we discussed patience, Commander.
Hey, that sounds interesting. You like it?
Where did you stop last?
Houston found it in the extraterrestrial's suit.
It's real, George.
None. And there's another one in the area that's alive. I don't know if it's the only one. I don't know if it was left here by accident or it's part of an inva...
We'll need a lot of help, George. You could hide an army up here.
Contain it and get back to me.
It's messy... the thing's got a gun... We're just asking for somebody to get killed...
I don't care where you're from you just can't disappear into thin air.
I'm not being unpatriotic, and I'm doing my damndest to catch them. Bell's up on 80 and I'm down here on 70 past Grand Junction. They're heading west. If they're not flying we have a damn good chance of getting them. All I'm asking is that you people think about it.
George... Do you hear me, George?
You've been through quite an ordeal, Mrs. Haydn. Why don't you stay where you are and let us pick you up? We'll fly you home.
Please...
I am husband?
Money.
What is...  ...Coke?
I will see it next time.
Sun...
That's not much time. I'll just slow you down. I have to sleep. I'm very tired. And I have to wash and eat. You don't...
You'll keep the car. I'll take a bus...  Am I going up there with you... in your ship... up there?
Then let me go. You don't need me.
Yes.
Eh... yes...
I'd love to have a baby. But I can't...
Your thumb tells the driver that you want a ride.
Well... I'm going to go now.
Yes. I have a long ride ahead of me...  Goodbye.
Jennyhaydn.
Yes.
It's bad.
Yes.
Nobody knows.
I like this music.
If I don't meet the ship, my people will go home without me.
I don't want you to be hurt.
Why can't we wait here for a ride?
Why don't you send one of your radio balloons and tell your captain that you might be late?
They are beautiful.
The cowboys were right. You can make money fast gambling.
May I have twenty-five cents, please?
Here are two quarters. When you lose these, you're not going to get anymore.
You won ten dollars. Big deal. If we don't get a good ride before dark we could miss your ship.
It'll tell you pretty much everything about us...
How long will it take you to get home?
Help me!!
Jesus Christ!! You crazy people...
I don't know where he is.
They after you?
Aghh... I'm supposed to umpire a little league game tomorrow.
That's because the ones that were hurt, died. They couldn't talk to you.
Good... It looks like we might be the welcoming committee, so I think we should try and figure out what we're gonna do if we have to come face to face with this creature.
There's a good chance you could be wrong about this thing then...
Listen to this.  A woman was kidnapped in Eau Claire this morning. When a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange 'clicking gibberish'...
Where are you going?
That's what I thought. So remember it was me because sometimes rewards come late, you know.
Hello...
We can't let you do that.
Superconducting QUantum Interference Device.  SQUID.  Got it?  There's gonna be a test.
I made my choice, Lenny.
This piece of puke hired me to kill you, baby.  Do you believe that? Isn't that right, Tran?  You pinhead.
You were supposed to go downstairs, baby.
And then she said, 'Since we're going to be spending so much time together--'
I feel like you're turning me into a VCR.
Cut it out, Tran.
Faith, call me, okay?
Well I haven't seen her in months. Who knows what's going on in her head.  You're really running out of excuses to come around, aren't you?
I understand.  No, I'm not.
No.
What kind of things exactly?
You see the look on that preppy puke's face?  Fuckin' pissed in his Topsiders.
Come on, amigo, the world's full of marks.  And nobody knows how to work 'em like you do, pal.  You could sell a goddamn rat's asshole for a wedding ring!  Let me buy you a drink.
Bobbyyyy!  Tequila por favor! Double shots.  Make it Tres Generaciones, huh.  Nothin' but the best for my good friend Lenny, the finest cop that ever got thrown off the vice squad.  Hey, nice tie.
I'm telling ya, it's over.  We used it all up--
Fairly twisted logic, Max, even for you.  Hey, at least you got a job!  Watch her for me.  Stay on her.
You alright?  Y'okay?
Come on, Lenny.  You used to be good at this stuff.  Play it down. What's the perp doing?
Top ten.
Looks like she was holding out.
Only he doesn't know about me and Faith.  So I say to myself, if I turn the job down, he just gets somebody else.  And I lose Faith... to coin a phrase.  So to buy time, I do the skank.  I still gotta do something about Tran... I figure it's him or me... but I can't cap him without a chump to take the fall.  And who better than his girlfriend's loser ex-boyfriend... a known criminal... who has been seen hassling them in public numerous times.
Yeah, but how'd it get to you?
I said that?  Look, I'll take it for five, and you'll make out okay, because in this case it's pure cream, you don't have to cut anything back to the wearer.
Whoa.  That is one unbelievable piece of eyefuck.
Yeah, she came by last night. Shaking like a junkie, wanting me to make a copy of some clip.
I always do.
Commissioner Strickland.
So, what's up with you?  Another busy night selling porno to wireheads?
Price he pays for being a scumsucking pig.
Lenny, this shit's illegal.
What's his name?
I need my case.  It's still in the back.
That would be no.
I know you wouldn't be saying all this if you didn't care about me. Thanks, Mace.  Really.
She thinks you're a bucket of dog vomit.  Trust me on this.
Bullet resistant?  Whatever happened to bullet proof?
Are you out of your fucking mind?!
The only card we have to play is the tape.  You know, we get it to the media somehow...
Who's Strickland?
Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's gonna do her right there unless--
Take it to him.
Are we under arrest?
Right.  That explains it.
No.  I haven't noticed because I make my payments.  So, Max Pelcher, how's the P.I. business?
Hey, isn't that Tran Vo?
Problem is, Lenny knows everybody.
Was this him?
Besides that.
...well, there was some friction: I wanted to write up my work, educate the public, but Koessler wouldn't allow it. Low felt Koessler was more interested in career advancement than catching killers. Koessler had Low reassigned to the Pacific Northwest, Seattle. You know when they say, stick it where the sun don't shine? That's where they stuck Dick Low.
Agents Duncan, Mackelway.  Anything new?
Excuse me, a salesman gets done in his car and you call the FBI?
Where's the Nuevo American Diner?
Nine bodies in Roswell, now this -- it's getting a little hairy, huh?
I want the autopsy report, where is it, Minnesota?
The family has gone through a lot. Their daughter missing, the search, her body found, the funeral -- then this order to exhume the corpse.
Ligature strangulation, just like his victims. A cord, nylon, you can tell by the indentation signature -- again, like his victims.  Look at that little thing and look at all the trouble it got him in. Should have cut it off.
Oh yes, I see. You must get asked this a lot.
You... surprised me.
Yeah.
What are you...?
My God.
You're going to miss it. Pay attention.
There was a car in the lot when we closed. Gone today.
Speck's the killer all right. We got box loads of evidence. Did 'em all the same way: torture, strangulation. Prostitutes. I don't think we'll be able to write off any outstandings on him -- this is probably the full body count.
Don't say that. Don't even think that. The next thing we'll be hearing about "Zorro Killer" in the media -- this hasn't gotten out, has it?
Deputy Director, get out, sir.
I might point out, Agent Mackelway, the reason we haven't been able to crack those rooms is that you refused to share that information with us -- which is also why you were reassigned.
The cut on your arm -- mind if we remove the bandage?
You feeling okay, Agent Mackelway?
Nothing concrete. Nothing I'd... well, nothing.
We're waiting for trace evidence results on the Rice killing.
You didn't tell anyone where you were?
Dick Low's a killer too.
Miss me, Dave?
Why did he come out here? What's going on?
Doesn't fit.
No, no, no, most of them -- I used to think all of them -- are just fantasists, guys who get off telling degrading stories. When I came across this fugitive chat room, listened in, I started to think some might actually be real, that they'd gone live. The challenge was to figure out which was which. Then I had my disagreement with Koessler.
Taking a Stryker saw, cutting off the top of someone's cranium, pulling the brain out -- what's that, a day in Spring?
What's that?
Every cop has a story and every story has a girl. The girl in my story was fifteen years-old. She wore a pink angora sweater -- I can still see it -- one day, she disappeared. I told the police she wouldn't run away, I told them who to look for, but I was just a kid. I sat in the police station crying and crying. My parents took me home. The girl was my cousin and the man who abducted her was a teacher I'd had. He kept her alive a week before he killed her. The police could have saved her. Every time I see a photo of a victim I see her. That's what I want to do. I want to save her.
None. Can't find a thing. Nothing on file, nothing online. It's not a part of any known killer's signature.
I ever get like that, just take me out in back and shoot me.
There are Agency regulations about this.
It's a no-no.
Find the feet?
You mean --
I came over because I couldn't sleep and was lonely. I wanted to see you. I thought I'd surprise you.
Where are you? Everybody's looking for you.
Start killing people for real?
I'd be real careful if I were you.
You okay?
All the same killer?
What happened?
Mack must think Zero has a police band.
Dave Koessler must have you jumping through hoops.
He couldn't break an egg with a hammer. He still writing those crime porn books?
This guy, Zero, he drifts around, that's how they all start, drifting around, their minds filling up with fantasies. He thinks he's real smart, laughs at us, laughs at his victims. But he has left a trail, and the trail is somewhere in those names. You know how to reach me.  Take my advice, when dealing with these FBI tight-asses, go by the book. That's what I did.
[Fantasy time, girls, give it up, give it up.]
[You want to talk, Lionheart, or you want to take this a little more personal?]
I've been to Chicago.
If I owe, I will go.
Haven't had any, but I'm willing to try.
Let's talk about Zero.
Leave this room, I'll go back with you, blow your cover.
Good morning, sir. Agent Salinas, sir.
I believe it's in my file, sir.
I see that. Washington to Philadelphia to here. Philly's a nice station. How many agents?
Agent Mackelway, you want to get off your ass and do something for a change?
Koessler?
"MyDick?"
How far is Amarillo?
I don't think you understand.
Deputy Director Koessler doesn't want Zero. All he cares about is Low.
He's a brilliant man. Brilliant enough to catch you.
You want to "profile" me? Find out what makes me "tick"? Write about me, go on a talk show, give me a nickname?
Oh, yeah... Boy, that must've been a while ago.
Probably a little longer than that, but, whatever.
Hi.
I'm Mike.
Like the quiche?
I like quiche.
My reputation seems to have preceded me.
...so I thought, what the hell, they make movies in L.A., not in Michigan, so I moved here.
Well, it wasn't the simple, but yeah.
Like what?
You don't think the guy would find me attractive enough to dance with?
Charles! What's up, man?
Oh, I'm sorry. How'd your folks take it?
Oh my God.
A couple of high rollers like you?
What do you guys do?
Yeah, but how long was the relationship she was rebounding from?
Well... This is it.
...Which one...?
How's it going? It's been a while...
How are you doing?
I couldn't. Do you know how hard it's been not to call you? I pick up the phone every night. Whenever that commercial comes on...
Hi.
Right... Wait, what do you mean?
Unless she comes back first.
...It's just that you've been there. Your advice really helps.
It's definitely a step back for me.
Haven't you noticed I didn't mention Michelle once today?
You want to hit the town tonight?
That doesn't sound too good for business.
Darwinism at its best.
No, I just promised myself I'd give it a try. I gotta get out there sooner or later.
I'm going in. Will you be my wing- man?
You haven't been drinking, have you?
I'm such an asshole.
I think I'm gonna move Back East.
What's dumb about it?
You miss the pain?
What's he do?
Big butt... you know, can't fly coach.
I'm so sorry, man. You were so right. I got rid of the gun
Good for you, man. He's being smart.
Hi. This is Nikki. Leaves a message.
Don't call me ever again.
I don't know, I don't know -- listen to you. We're gonna have fun tonight. We gotta get you out of that stuffy apartment.
We're going to Vegas.
Tonight, baby.
What are you wearing? I mean, we should wear suits.
Wake up, baby.
Pirates of the fucking Caribbean.
They're all skanks.
That's not cool.
It doesn't matter...
Don't make fun, I think we can get some free shit if we don't fuck around.
I don't know, what? Thirty, Forty maybe.
You think so?
That was so fuckin' money. It was like that "Jedi mind" shit.
I'm just trying to be a gentleman, show some respect...
No!
Wait...  She's crying. I finish. I hold up my finger like "Wait a second". They sit in silence for, like, at least five minutes. I look up and they all start clapping, and now they're all crying. Even the camera guy.
No, man. I need to use the phone.
That was different.
I was younger... It was college. You didn't go to college, you don't know what it's like. You screw chicks you have no business being with. They're young, they don't know any better.
...a day...
Selling scrap metal.
He drives a carriage.
I hear he drives a carriage around Central Park or something.
I hear she's getting real fat.
...Maybe. I mean you gotta hide all the lights...
What are you doing?
She didn't see.
Tomorrow?
I don't know. I guess kids were hitting each other or something.
Oh, it's on, baby...
...we're not...
...and big fuckin' teeth...
...You're just poking at it...
You're money.
...Oh, who would jack your fuckin K- car? He's right, Sue. You don't need no gat.
It's on...
Beautiful. What time are you off...  ...Christy?
Yes, I understand.  I'm listening.
Be my friend.
What do you wish me to do?
Jesus, Connie...Sure, Mike...
Don't be frightened.  Do you think I'd make my sister a widow?  Do you think I'd make your children fatherless?  After all, I'm Godfather to your son.  No, your punishment is that you're out of the family business.  I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas--and I want you to stay there.  I'll send Connie an allowance, that's all. But don't keep saying you're innocent; it insults my intelligence and makes me angry.  Who approached you, Tattaglia or Barzini?
What was that?
You're staying home.  You're not going out.
You filthy guinea spoiled brat. Clean it up or I'll kick your head in.
Sollozzo knows Mike's a civilian.
I want somebody very good, very safe to plant that gun.  I don't want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hand.
We gotta fight sometime.  Let us at least recruit our regimes to full strength.
He's going to be our lawyer in Vegas.  Nobody goes to him with any other business as of now, this minute.  No reflection on Tom; that's the way I want it.  Besides, if I ever need any advice, who's a better Consigliere than my father.
Outside.
I'll think about it.
Good for ten men...
My business is heroin, I have poppy fields, laboratories in Narseilles and Sicily, ready to go into production.  My importing methods are as safe as these things can be, about five per cent loss.  The risk is nothing, the profits enormous.
I need two million dollars in cash...more important, I need a friend who has people in high places; a friend who can guarantee that if one of my employees be arrested, they would get only light sentences.  Be my friend.
My compliments.  I'll take care of them from my share.
He's his own boss, and very competent.
He was the one behind Sollozzo?
Tom, I never thought you were a bad Consigliere, I thought Santino a bad Don, rest in peace.  He had a good heart but he wasn't the right man to head the family when I had my misfortune.  Michael has all my confidence, as you do.  For reasons which you can't know, you must have no part in what will happen.
And this?
Have you thought about a wife?  A family?
I understand, Michael.  But you must make a family, you know.
Accept what's happened, Michael.
Barzini will move against you first.
Don Tommassino.
That is your birthright...but Michael, use this car.
Hey, beautiful girls!
Why didn't Moe Green meet us at the airport?
Give them some money and send them home.
What about Luca?  Sollozzo didn't seem worried about Luca.  That worries me.
Tom, you're the Consigliere, what do we do if the old man dies?
Maybe Mike shouldn't get mixed up in this so directly.  You know the old man doesn't want that.
I found out about this Captain McCluskey who broke Mike's jaw. He's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll, and for big money. McCluskey's agreed to be the Turk's bodyguard.  What you have to understand is that while Sollozzo is guarded like this, he's invulnerable.  Nobody has ever gunned down a New York Police Captain.  Never.  It would be disastrous.  All the five families would come after you Sonny; the Corleone family would be outcasts; even the old man's political protection would run for cover.  So just...take that into consideration.
Sonny was hot for my deal, right? You know it's the smart thing to do, too.  I want you to talk Sonny into it.
The Don was slipping; in the old days I could never have gotten to him.  Now he's dead, nothing can bring him back.  Talk to Sonny, talk to the Caporegimes, Clemenza and Tessio...it's good business.
Christ, Tom; I needed more time with him.  I really needed him.
I've never seen anything like it.
Once upon a time, about fifteen years ago some people wanted to take over my father's olive oil business.  They had Al Capone send some men in from Chicago to kill my father, and they almost did.
What will your father say?
What time do they expect us?
Michael?
Can you say it?
I can't...
Look.  I'll see you tonight, OK?
We'll go to the show tomorrow night--we can change the tickets.
Will you?
I was worried when we couldn't get in touch with you in that hick town.
Then wait, Sonny.  Talk to Pop.
We can't wait.  No matter what Sollozzo say about a deal, he's figuring out how to kill Pop.  You have to get Sollozzo now.
I'm glad you came, Mike.  I hope we can straighten everything out.  All this is terrible, it's not the way I wanted things to happen at all. It should never have happened.
Do you pledge to guide and protect this child if he is left fatherless? Do you promise to shield him against the wickedness of the world?
The Corleone family wants to buy me out.  I buy you out.  You don't buy me out.
You think I scam?
You goddamn dagos.  I do you a favor and take Freddie in when you're having a bad time, and then you try to push me out.
You straightened my brother out?
Yeah.
I think so.  Detective squad?
Is he alive?
Fausto and I -- we took the boat out, we were fishing, and then it was dawn and we'd caught absolutely nothing.
We?
Tom was telling me about his trip over. Made me laugh so much I got a nosebleed.
Uncanny!
I'll come down.
You'd say if you mind?
Now you know why Miss Sherwood always shows up for breakfast. It's not love it's the coffee machine.
Dubious but special honor, Tom -- crewing Dickie's boat. Alright, bar's open.
If you're not at my place by 7.00, Tom and I are running off together.
He's drowning me!
Who's this?
I like to sail, believe me, I love to sail! Instead I make boats and other people sail them.
You're a dark horse, Ripley. Engaged?
Could we sail to Venice?
I have to go to Venice.
The mysterious Mr Ripley. Marge and I spend hours speculating.  Cold beer. Thank you Dad.
I know. I write like a child.
Means we never shared a bath. I'm cold. Can I get in?
You've got to get a new jacket. Really. You must be sick of the same clothes. I'm sick of seeing you in them.
Shoes too?
Freddie drove me back in his car.
He's downstairs.
What's the fight about? That's her fiancee, isn't it? Are they blaming him?
She came to me for help, she needed money, and I didn't help her. I didn't help her. Now she's dead and it's my fault.
Ha.
Of course. Let's say, for argument's sake, you were here -- perhaps we could split the rent on a house -- I'll get a job -- or, better still, I could get a place in Rome and when we're there we could be there and if we're here we could be here --
You love me and you're not marrying me.
What?
The funny thing -- I'm not pretending to be somebody else and you are. I'm absolutely honest with you. I've told you my feelings. But you, first of all I know there's something -- that evening when we played chess, for instance, it was obvious --
Frederico!
This is Tom Ripley. Freddie Miles.
Come on, Frederico, do you really have to go back? At least stick around for the Festival of the Madonna.
Just point her at Capri and avoid the rocks.
Yes, I'm good, thank you. Dickies at dinner. He's at Otello's. Do you know it?
Hardly.
I'm well, thank you.
Tom.
You were right about the telephones. There are no lines, there's some problem.
I never said that!
Which is ridiculous. Boats are female, everyone knows you can't call a boat after a man.
The thing with Dickie -- it's like the sun shines on you and it's glorious, then he forgets you and it's very very cold.
Hello Marge.
I don't know. I don't understand Dickie, Marge, so your guess is as good as mine.
Well, one day I'm invited skiing, the next day I'm not, one day we're all one family, the next day he wants to be alone. You tell me.
Thanks. He knows I love this, although why it couldn't have waited...
How long's he staying for?
Is he here? Are you with Dickie?
I tried again, waiting here, watching for him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look for Dickie I find you.  What happened to your face?
Hello Peter, so good to see you.
Dickie promised me he would never take off this ring.
I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf.
He promised me. I swear I'll never take off this ring until the day --
I don't know. Peter has a concert in Athens next month -- and he's asked if I want to go along, help out. He says goodbye by the way -- he's in rehearsal, otherwise --
We think he's had a change of heart.  So we should be celebrating.
What's funny?
What's your secret?
As in the Textile Logues. Trying to shrug off the dress. I travel under my mother's name, too.
At Christmas. To Cortina with Freddie Miles and --
What?
Dove e stato il signor Ripley da allora?
Questa lettera e stata trovata nell'abitazione del signor Richard Greenleaf a Roma.
I know the Piazza di Spagna. What time?
Sorry, sorry. Had to renew my papers. Italian bureaucracy -- never one stamp when they can make you line up for three. Have you been waiting long?
In Rome, about three weeks ago.  I knew that one.
No.
What did he say?
But you're still tormented, you must be, you've killed somebody...
I'm sorry. I was asleep. I must have fallen asleep.
Tom, are you okay?
Ask me what I want to change about this moment.
Or Tom and Peter even.
Really, why?  Sorry, I'm completely lost.
What do you mean lied about who you are?
Good things about Tom Ripley? Could take some time!... Tom is talented. Tom is tender... Tom is beautiful...
Senta. We have to ask you to stay in Rome.
Thank you.
No, I have and so has Miss Sherwood, ask her! And if I could remember which hotel he was staying at -- the Goldoni! -- Tom was staying at the Goldoni.
Some of these guns are like toys, but a Smith and Wesson, man, you can hit somebody over the head with it and it will still come back dead on. Nothing beats quality.  You interested in an automatic?
Is there a firing range around?
You like ball games?
Where do you live?
What kind of people?
What did you do?
Huh?
You know what you remind me of?
That song by Kris Kristofferson, where it's said "Like a pusher, party truth, partly fiction, a walking contradiction".
I didn't mean that, Travis. Just the part about the contradiction.
Your stereo broke? God, I could hardly stand that. I live on music.
So you haven't heard this record yet?
But this is a porno movie.
What about the record?
No, no, please. This fare's on me. Please.
Tom, come here a moment.  I think this canvas report is about ready to go out. Check it out with Andy, and if he okays if, have a copy made for the campaign headquarters in every county.  And don't forget to add the new photo releases.
Have you ever wondered why CBS News has the highest ratings?
Just what?
How long has he been there?
No. I just wanted to see if you could light it that way. The guy at the newsstand can.
No, stupid. With the stubs. That's the whole point.
What is your name? My name is Travis.
Yeah, that's Blush-On. My wife uses it,
Threw on the emergency, jumped the seat and fucked her brains out -- What do you think!  What do I have to do? Draw you a picture?
Well, I said, "Lady, please, we're on a bridge..."
Yeah. We went to Harvard together.
You run all over town, don't you, Travis?
...he called up the Dispatcher last night. Charlie McCall, our dispatcher...
20 bucks?
We better make it, or Sport'll get mad. How do you want to make it?
But you're the one that wanted to get away. You're the one that came into my cab.
Do they drug you?
Listen...
Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it!
But that one night?
Well, I tried.
Can I see you again?
But you can't live like this. It's hell. Girls should live at home.
Why not?
You a scorpion? That's it. You're a scorpion. I can tell.
Why?
You a narc?
What should I do? Call the cops?
Then it's a good guess it's grounded.
I'm sure you'll win, sir. Everybody I know is going to vote for you.  I was going to put one of your stickers on my taxi but the company said it was against their policy.
No trouble with the Hack Bureau?
You kiddin? Who else would hack through South Bronx or Harlem at night?
I'll work anywhere, anytime. I know I can't be choosy.
Sorry, sir. I didn't mean that.
No.
Is it hard to get to be a Secret Service Man?
I kinda thought I might make a good one. I'm very observant.
I saw. $20 fifteen minutes. $30 half hour.
Travis.
So howsit?
Real down.
Had a close one.
Could we change the subject?
Hey!  Now there's some good news.
Don't stop...  do no stop.
Maybe.  Not really.
He's got a gun, sir.
What do you do for the F.B.I., Goodspeed.
John Mason.  ' Don't be shocked.  I don't have much time.  Please listen carefully  ....
Mason, uhm, John, I have something to tell you.  You know that pardon= contract you signed?
Well... let me tell you, I'm not Luke.  I know who I am now, and you don't.  And... I don't like me very much.
Not exactly light reading, I know. Believe it or not, I've read this since high school, and it got me all the way through law school. Besides, there's something in there that'll help you.  You won't have to get very far, it's near the beginning.
Tell them Pete.  Tell them...
Yeah, well it's not everyday you get  news like this.  You're sure he's  okay?  Other than the  bump on the head?
What.
I do?
You first.
So, you're really gonna be a lawyer?
Have you always wanted to be a lawyer?
You don't have a boyfriend or anyone... you know... like that?
Now, did you remember that, or...
Yes, sir.
Now, I see that you've been running a movie theater in Lawson called "The Bijou," is that also true?
Yes... yes, I do.
Well, I'd direct the attention of counsel and committee to line thirty-six of the document, and the name printed and signed there.
Mr. Appleton?  Mr. Appleton?
"It's a Wonderful Life?"
Excuse me... what's your, um, your name?
And... what's my name again?
Wait'll you see the inside!
We've been closed for a while.
Exactly how long has the Bijou been closed?
I promised him a new uniform when we re-opened.  And you'll get one, too.
Carl.  Friend of yours from high school.  Everybody calls him "Cueball."
You bet.
And you have sixty-eight dollars and thirty-seven cents in the bank. Your only source of income are my veteran's death benefit of forty dollars a month, to which you're no longer entitled since I'm alive, and these ten dollar a month cash deposits you make.  What are those?
I'm not happy about this, mind you, but if I have to go, at least I'm going in my own bed, the same bed my Lily died in, and... knowing that my son is alive.  That's not too shabby, is it?
You tight with J. Edgar Hoover?
Zackly.
Nope.  Can't.  We're through.
Well, you've been wet to the skin. You must've fallen in.
Do you remember if you were driving a car?  Maybe you went over the bridge.  No guard rail there, it's easy to do.  It's happened before.
You think he's drunk somewhere?
Are you saying it's a mistake, that you didn't go to any meetings? They say you did.
So, you're saying that it's true. You went to a meeting of a known communist organization.
They know you were at that meeting, Peter.  They've been told, and they know.
Peter, I believe in you.  More to the point, I read your new script... um...
Don't say that.  There is no such thing as a blacklist.  Now, are you gonna play ball?
However... you're gonna be subpoenaed to testify before the Un-American Activities Committee when they open hearings in Los Angeles.  Now, if you play ball and tell them what they want to hear, they'll clear you.
Exactly.
Not at all.
Peter, I'm an agent.  I buy lunches and get deals made for guys like you.  That's what I do.  You're a writer.  You write pictures. That's what you do.  And trust me, you'll be back doing it again tomorrow morning.
Her name was right there in front of them.  They gave it to me, I didn't give it to them.
Thank me publicly?  For what?  For ruining this woman's life?
I haven't danced with another man since Mr. Terwilliger passed.
I can play the piano?
That's my r-r-rent.
Tim, I have to tell you something.
It's about me.
I'm... I'm not Luke.  Luke is dead. He died in the war.  He's not coming back, and I'm not him.  I don't even belong here.  This whole thing started out as an accident, and that's all it is.  An accident.
They all know you?
Ernie Cole here just got himself elected mayor.  Lost both his boys in the war.  Kenny at Anzio and Willie at Normandy.
Said as much myself, Doc.  Can't place him, though.  To look at him, you'd think the cheese slid off his cracker.  Well, morning's half-over.  I'm off.
Now that you remember who you are, were you planning on telling anyone your true identity?
Cathy?
That's the one. Cathy Brenner.
I've been wanting a cigarette for the past twenty minutes, but I couldn't convince myself to stop. This 'tilling of the soil' can get a little compulsive, you know.
Do I?  No, I'm an open book, I'm afraid.  Or maybe a closed one.  Pretty. What are they?
Miss Daniels? Is that you?
Well, I don't suppose it offers much to the casual visitor. Unless you're thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside. It takes a while to get used to.
I don't understand.
Someone ought to tell her she'd be gaining a daughter.
I'm sorry. Forgive me.
Yes.
Mom, they're in a cage!
Is smoking fun?
Oh. Where d'you want the coffee?
I'm looking for a man named Mitchell Brenner.
Yes, but where?
See them two big trees across there?
The two kids?
The front door.  Isn't there a back road I can take?
You see, I wanted to surprise them.
I didn't want to come right down the road, where they could see me.
Yes?
Gulls!
Are you finished here, Sebastian?
Here's your pie, Sebastian. You want it at the table?
You did say birds?
Seven o'clock, same as usual.
Forgive me. I suppose I'm just naturally curious about a girl like that.  She's very rich, isn't she?
She is the one who jumped into that fountain in Rome last summer, isn't she?
If there are... larger birds, Mitch... they'll get into the house.
Mitch...
They're gone. The same pattern.
We won't be here.
No, it's me, Mrs. Brenner. I thought you might like some tea.
I couldn't ask you to.
That's the last of it.
No, I gotta admit this is peculiar.  Did you have a light burning or something.
My wife found a bird in the back seat of her car once.
Does this room look silly?
Oh.
I wonder if you could help me.
Lovebirds, sir?
Well... yes, sir, there are.
I think so, sir.  Now then, let me see.
Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know.
Yes, I see.  About those lovebirds, Miss...
We never met in court or anyplace else.
When?
What do you call your lovebird story if not a practical...
You knew I didn't work here. You deliberately...
Is that why you'd like to see everyone behind bars?
To bring your sister those birds. You said it was her birthday. Besides, I was coming up anyway.
To see a friend of mine.  Will you please be careful?
Why...
Annie. Annie Hayworth.
But you were coming up anyway, remember?
After all, you did go to the trouble of bringing up those birds.
Certainly, but...
Why did he shoot her?
Without any clothes on?
So you didn't go to school together.
What did it say?
They're probably hungry, that's all. This was a bad summer. They eat berries and... and nuts, you know, and the hills are all burned out, so they're probably searching for food wherever they can get it.
It's so damn quiet out there.
What do you mean?
I hadn't thought of that.  And then the swifts came.
Melanie...
I think it's safe to get out now.
How long have they been gathering there?
Even the birds sitting out there. It does look very much the same, Mitch. This could be last week.
Santa Rosa?
I know. Oh, I know.  I've been calling all morning. Oh, you have no idea. Miss Daniels, they're so difficult to get, really they are. We get them from India, you know, when they're just little chicks, and then we have to...
Well, yes, he'll talk. Well, no, no. You'll have to teach him to talk.
That... that... who was that?
No, the birds didn't attack until the children were outside the school. Crows, I think. I don't know, Daddy. Is there a difference between crows and blackbirds?
They're both perching birds, of course, but of quite different species. The crow is brachyrhynchos. The blackbird is cyanocephalus.
Yes, all right, I'll wait for you. Good-by.
Doesn't it seem odd that they'd wait all that time to start a... a war against humanity?
Look, Mitch, even if this is true, even if all the birds...
I like Bodega Bay as well as any man. If I thought...
Help how? What do you want to do?
That's right, sir, I recall it. A large flock of seagulls got lost in a fog and headed in for the town, where all the lights were.
I'm going out that way, lady. You can follow me.
I haven't finished my drink.
There, Master Fettes.  Sooner than we had expected.  A stoke of luck one might say.
I don't know that I can do that, Mrs. Marsh.
Good morning, Mrs. Marsh.
You must leave this house.
He's not home.
You don't went to find him. Your news will keep until I tell him.
There's no standing between a fool and his folly. If you must babble your news to him he's at the Fisherman's Tryst. It's the inn at Pennycuik. You can use MacFarlane's horse and gig to get there. He'll welcome the ride back.
Excuse me, Dr. MacFarlane --
I'm afraid I'll have to give up medicine, Dr. MacFarlane.
I'm afraid I have to, sir.  You see, my father is vicar at Thrums -- it's a small parish -- not much of a living --
But this woman -- and her son --
It was about last night I wanted to talk to you -- about the operation on the little Marsh girl.
But you did promise.
What do you mean, Fettes?
I thought this was a school day.
I'm by way of being a medical myself.
I will not have you use that name to me.
It might be an interesting case.
Now that wasn't a friendly thing I heard, Toddy.  Not at all friendly.
But what makes a thought start?
I brought you something tonight, MacFarlane -- an interesting specimen -- in very good condition.
What I was going to say is this -- wouldn't you be more comfortable at Leith in a neat little house?
You say you've come here on your own account?  No one knows you are here?
No digging Joseph. The churchyards are too well guarded. We will "Burke" them,
Was the paralysis immediate?
I regret it, Ma'am, but I have the responsibility of training thirty other doctors to attend a thousand children like your own.
It was one thing her dad rejected you. But when she did you lost it.
Leonard, Dutton, Erlich. They don't matter. I want the King.
Wrong. Answer.
What did they give you?
I was a friend of your sister's.
I've been shot, and stabbed and thrown from a car and none of it hurt. But what you're doing now, does. I don't know why.
Are you ok?
No. You don't.
... took everything I ever cared about. Left me with nothing.
I wish I could hate him but I can't. He said he'd never hurt either of us, and I know it's true and... I'm going back.
Erin. Who?
... it connects you to me...
In the woods you said you had nothing. But you wouldn't, and I wouldn't if there's some way you don't have to go. Please. At least not right away.
They botched the execution.
If you had a license, I bet I'd have seen it by now. How old are you? Fifteen?
Look, can I just call a cab?
Stay in the car. I'll only take a second.
Erin!
What is it?
Honey. It's doesn't mean anything. It's not a message.
It still doesn't mean...
What about the people who are coming to the meeting tonight? Have they all arrived?
You have faith, Professor Barnhardt
I would like to explain something of my mission here.
In the hands of a mature civilization, these would not be considered weapons of aggression. But in the hands of your people--  We've observed your aggressive tendencies, and we don't trust you with such power.
I'm afraid I can't offer you any real protection. I have no influence in cases of inter-planetary conspiracy.
One thing, Mr. Klaatu. Suppose this group should reject your proposals. What is the alternative?
We sure had fun today. We saw the space ship and we went to see Professor Barnhardt -- and--
Did you and Mr. Carpenter really go to see Professor Barnhardt?
Mom -- is there something wrong with Mr. Carpenter?
Bobby--! What are you doing up at this hour?
Now think back hard. You didn't follow Mr. Carpenter at all, did you? You haven't even been out of the house.
Bobby -- who's the greatest man in America today?
Well -- Professor Barnhardt, I guess. He's the greatest scientist in the world.
Boy, I'll bet he's strong. I bet he could knock down a whole building.
Wouldn't you like to meet him?
Bet he's the only one in the world knows the answer.
I'll tell you, Bobby -- I've been away for a long time. Very far away.
I've got some money. My mother gave me two dollars.
What do you want it for, Mr. Carpenter?
The skeletal structure is completely normal.  Same for the major organs - heart, liver, spleen, kidneys.
I don't believe it.
The President asked me to convey his deepest apologies for what has happened. We all feel--
Naturally we're very curious to know where it is you come from.
It's rather difficult for us to think of another planet as a neighbor.
Perhaps you'd rather discuss it personally with the President--
I'm afraid that would be a little awkward. It's -- it's completely without precedent. And there are practical considerations -- the time involved -- the enormous distances.
You must have a rather strange impression of us.
I will make that recommendation to the President.  I must tell you in all honesty that I'm extremely dubious about the results.
Our problems are very complex, Mr. Klaatu. You mustn't judge us too harshly.
You're a good salesman -- but I've got to think about it.
He's not there.  But look what I found in his room
Helen, he's the man from the space ship!  I had that diamond checked at three different places. Nobody on earth's ever seen a stone like that! After what Bobby told us, that's enough for me. Why is it nobody knows anything about him? Why hasn't he got any money?
Important? Of course it's important. The point is we can do something about it.
You wait and see. You're going to marry a big hero!
Everyone seems so--
Bobby's the only person I know who isn't -- Jittery.
Mr. Carpenter -- this is none of my business, but -- why did that detective come here last night?
Mr. Carpenter, I--  Goodnight.
I -- I was Just going to lunch.
Why not?
You hold great hope for this meeting.
Where are you going now?
I'm sure Barnhardt can arrange to hide me until the meeting.
Hello.
I was.
How did you get in here? And what do you want?
That's what I wanted you to tell me.
No -- no, thanks.
The Professor's secretary says she found you in Barnhardt's room, making marks on his blackboard.
Your name's Carpenter -- that right?  Any identification, Mr. Carpenter? Driver's license -- social security number?
Okay -- book him and get him fixed up.  Looks like everybody's goin' nuts.
May I suggest that you call the Professor?
I don't like horror comics.
We're fighters for Truth, Justice, and the American Way.
Salt sticks to the bottom of his feet.
They're gaining on us!
Should I run him through?
Good.
Whattaya mean?
Death to all vampires!
I can't beat a Triumph.
We were gonna grab some food.
Where is she?!
Where you going?
He's telling the truth!  Aren't you, Michael?
No, Nanook!  Quiet!
Lucy, you're the only woman I ever knew didn't improve her situation by getting divorced.
Good!
You didn't tell David?
Michael, are you still in bed?
Okay?
There's only three weeks left of summer, Michael.  Things are going to change around here when school starts.
What's wrong?  Tell me.
These are my dinner guests. Edgar and Alan.  The Frog Brothers.
What did you say?
Ohmygod...
So what can I help you find tonight, Lucy?  We've got it all.  Best selection in Santa Carla.
Is it okay for the guest to see the food before the dinner?
This looks terrific, Lucy.
I'm really sorry, Max.
I don't understand Sam.  He's just not like this.
Let me tell you something about boys.  They're like weeds.  They grow best when they're ignored.
Ouch.
I have to talk to you.  Please wake up.
That night in the cave -- that wasn't wine they gave me to drink... it was blood!  David's blood.  I'm one of them, Star!  I'm just like them!
Huh?
You don't suppose Grandpa's an alien, do you?
Did you spill something?
I told you it was pretty weird Chinese food.
Lose the earring, Michael.  It's not happening.  It's just not happening.
No!  We can't tell Mom!  Please, Sam.  Don't tell her.
Who are you calling?
Maybe dinner.
What do you mean "got" to the dog?
What was he doing in the rec room?
Well, where was he?  Where did he go?
What the hell you looking at me like that for?
Sure.  You think there's a connection?
Whatever that Norwegian dog was... It... It was capable of changing its form...  ... when it attacked our dog... it somehow was able to digest... or... absorb it... and in the process shaped its own cells to imitate our dog's cells exactly...  ... This for instance isn't dog at all -- it's imitation... We got to it before it had time to finish or...
Too damn dangerous.
... Can't you see...?  If one cell of this Thing got out it could imitate every living thing on Earth. Nothing could stop it!  Nothing!
How you doin', old boy?
Don't get near 'em.  The plants! They're alive.  Those things can imitate anything...
What's happening?
MacReady!
Yeah, they dig him up and cart him back.  He gets thawed out, wakes up and scares the shit out of them. And they get into one hell of a brawl...
I can get maybe another five or six feet out of it.
MacReady!
... Nothing human could have made it back here in this weather without a guideline...
You ain't tying me up.
We should have jumped his ass.
Would that test have worked?
And if anyone tries to wake me...
Yes, there is.  I'd like to go up.
Right.  Why not?
Couple seconds of an Argentine disco station.
Look, if you're going to keep bitching, MacReady -- Palmer's offered to take him up...
No it ain't there.  Would I be asking if it were there?
Sanchez...?  Hey, who...
We've got to find Fuchs.  When we find him -- we kill him.
We're going to draw a little bit of everybody's blood.
You and Nauls got to block off the west side bunks, the mess hall and the kitchen.
Got Sanchez... World War Three wouldn't mess with this fucker... Can go through walls... And it's like all over the place...
Somebody else sure as hell thought so.
We should sleep in shifts.
How can they just go back to work as if nothing happened?
No one ever comes here.  My mother told me stories about it late at night.  They tell all the children.
... Well, you wanted to see it.
You know of them?
Yes...
It's what they want you to see.
Vox --
Takes a licking but keeps on ticking...  ... For a while anyway.
Go back to the light.  You weren't made for this.  I was... I was made for this moment.
Why would you let me go back?
So you take their best...
She won't remember you.  None of them will.  You will be forgotten. That is how history works.
And why not?
Well, much obliged -- I'm always forgetting the confounded brake -- say, if you wait until I get her up and running I'll give you a perambulation.  Tell you all about her.
Dance with me...
Oh dammit, I love you!  I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't think, all I do is moon over you and -- hum, apparently.
Darling.
Alex...?!
My God...
Damned if I can keep her out of my equations.
I don't.  I want them to run along this street and knock off every bowler they see.
In the future, we'll be better.
The most able inventor I know and you can't tie a simple four-in- hand.
She made the best Shepherd's pie I ever tasted.
All these clocks -- how can you constantly be running late?!
You know that's what it is.  Mrs. Watchit tells me you're here at all hours -- day and night --
I know that --
I'll tell you what... come by for dinner in a week and I'll show you.
That's absurd --
All right.  I'll come for dinner. And in the meantime... you'll think about what we discussed?
Couldn't help but overhearing.  Two fine young people starting out on the road of life.  I wish you the very best.
Did you hear me, lad?
Yes.
His curiosity is amazing.
Oh, that explains everything.
I'll take you to your machine tomorrow.
You seem fascinated by the stars.
Don't then have stars where you come from?
Yes!
This is magnificent...
It's not supposed to be easy, it's supposed to be beautiful.
It has no purpose.  It's just beautiful... Does everything have a purpose where you come from?
And there's no shame to that.  It's all the same here.  Everyone has an important job to do.  We all work together and couldn't survive without each other.
Those rocks, over there... they're the same... this is... Central Park.
Yes... a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship- shape.
Kalen...
Now that's more like it.  You look a proper gentlemen for once.
As I recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is "Applied Mathematics and Engineering", am I correct?
"Eloi"?
We had another visitor from beyond the valley about four years ago. His name was Moren.  Do you know him?
I am the oldest.
This is out life, Alexander.  It's a hard life but it is how we have always lived.
Sir, if I may --
If I might explain, sir --
Yes, sir.
[Beat] Listen, I hate to bother you...
I don't give a shit about your patient!
I know. [Beat] I knew that when you came out.
The three of you weren't regular patients. You were criminals that ended up at Alpine Grove.
How did you come to know their names?
Look here, I don't like you getting in my face and saying this bullshit to me...
You done with your small talk?
This is really happening, isn't it?
Well, Dr. Lorenson is still here at the hospital. If she was here at the time your father was, then I'm sure she'd be of more help to you.
I'm sorry? Your face looks awfully familiar, I just can't quite place it...
You're just gonna walk?
No, I don't have anything to show you. I'm here from a mental hospital.
Stop it! Stop it! JACKIE covers her ears and looks at him, pleading with her eyes. STARKS' eyes plead right back.
You can't be William Starks. He's dead.
I'm telling you I don't care what time you think you're in. You're not William Starks. [Beat] I don't believe in many things, but I believe in death. And it doesn't give back what it takes. So whoever you are...I did a nice thing, you've made me regret it enough already, so please, just leave.
[Softly] I want to trust you. Should I trust you?
I might not be able to.
They're not here.
What? What are you thinking?
Then why isn't there anyone around?
They've got lives to be grateful for.
I think so.
It's ok. It's ok. Relax. It's just a cut. We can get it fixed. But we need to get you to the hospital now. How'd you get that?
How?
I don't understand.
Because I don't think I'm crazy.
You were convicted of the crime.
Why, what would you do?
No. I don't want it to.
How'd he get it?
I don't know. [Frustrated] Remember?
[Beat] I've seen a time that's not this time. And I'm only able to see it when I'm in the Jacket.
What about the world?
[Beat] Like who? Like MacKenzie maybe?
I know. I know it all. Save your strength. I already know everything you're going to say. [Beat] You're in the Jacket right now, aren't you?
Who...who kills me?
Can I get some paper and something to write with.
I do believe you...
He's having absence [pronounced "absance"] seizures when he stares off into space like he does. He has them so often that that's why he hasn't learned to speak properly.
I tried to kill my wife.
You ever been to jail?
In case you hadn't figured, it's Christmas Eve. You're never gonna get a cab here.
Well, where are you from?
Well, how'd you get here?
Great. That was our last option. What am I going to do with you?
So you're a waitress, right? I mean...from the uniform you were wearing.
[Beat] Why'd you stop?
Well, good for you.
Yeah. [Beat] How about you?
How?
Damnit, Thelma, don't holler like that!  Haven't I told you I can't stand it when you holler in the morning.
Have a good day at work today.
Funny how so many people wanna buy carpet on a Friday night.  You'd almost think they's want to forget about it for the weekend.
... only for one day and we'll be back tomorrow night.
Darryl.
Honey?
On what?
Yeah, I could too.  But... I don't know why I'm even asking you this. It's just... we can't place anybody at the scene but these two gals that everybody swears is sweet as pie. I don't know.  I keep hearing words -- impossible -- inconceivable.  If just one person would say...
Who's the nut?
He said he took it to a motel in Oklahoma City.  He also says that at that time he met a man.  He identified you through a series of mug shots.  He also told us that you and Mrs. Dickinson seemed "close." Is that true?
Could you identify 'em, if ya saw 'em again?
Alright.
That's certainly possible.
I swear to God, she wouldn't tell me one thing!  Christ!  You oughta try to find that kid that was with 'em.
This is serious, son.  A man is dead.
We're going to leave someone here at the house in the event that she calls in.  Someone will be here until we find them.
Oh shit.
Stop.
Tell me.
Good answer.  Same goes double for me.
Well, come on, gal, I got you a room.  You can go on in and take a nice cold shower.
Louise!  Where are you?  Are you alright?  Honey...
Okay.  I'll call you back.  In an hour.  Don't tell Darryl.
And what's the mysterious code word?
What?
Don't worry darlin'.  I'll say I never found you.  I'll say anything you want.  We'll find a way to get you out of this, whatever it is.
Well, wait now.  I still have to ask Darryl if I can go.
I don't know.  Warm stuff, I guess. It's the mountains.  I guess it gets cold at night.  I'm just gonna bring everything.
In case of what?
Oh yeah, sure, Thelma, that lantern will come in real handy.  Maybe we could tow your car behind, in case he steals the spark plugs.
I haven't seen a place like this since I left Texas.
Thelma!
Shouldn't we go to the cops?  I mean, I think we should tell the police.
If you weren't so concerned with having a good time, we wouldn't be here right now.
I'm cash poor.
Oh, I don't know.  I'm just nervous. I gotta figure out what to do.
You talked to him?!  Is he mad?  Did you tell him?
Wait.  What?  You want to go to Mexico from Oklahoma and you don't want to go through Texas?
I'm sorry.  I am happy.  I'm very happy for you.  I'm glad you had a good time.  It's about time.  Where is he now?
Eighty-eight dollars ain't gonna make a dent, baby girl.
You think you've found your calling?
You're disturbed.
So what's the plan, Thelma?  You just gonna stay drunk?
That J.D. kid is a little shit.
Just stop talkin' to people, Thelma! Stop bein' so open!  We're fugitives now.  Let's behave that way!
Idaho?
Whaddo we do?
Before.
This is so beautiful.
Look!  Look who it is, Thelma.  I'll be darned.  What's he doin' way out here.
I'm warning you, Thelma.  You better drop it right now!  I don't want to talk about it!
What?
I said all that?
You're not gonna make some deal with that guy, are you?  I mean, I just wanna know.
He said they're charging us with murder.
How far are we from Mexico?
There's one thing you oughta understand by now, Thelma, it's not your fault.
You're a good friend.
I guess everything we've got to lose is already gone anyway.
Louise!
Go.
Isn't that just my luck -- I get caught for everything.
This wasn't your first time, was it, Ted? How many we talking?
Look at me, Mary. On my mother's soul, on God above, on everything that is holy to me, I did not steal your shoes.
I'm asking you to leave.
You're leaving it out. Finish your swing.  You're going to like this one -- she's half Asian, half American.
Well why don't you look her up?
So that was it? One bump in the road and you gave up?
Maybe you're right. I should look on the bright side. I mean, I've still got my health...  I'm out of here. I've got to get up at six a.m. to move my boss's brother into his apartment.
Shoot.
And this adversely affects me how...?
Fuck me.  Let's go home.
Got cash.
Check.
Okay, sounds like you're all set. Just clean the pipes and it's a go.
You know, clean the pipes.
Why's that?
Wrong. It's because you ain't got the baby batter in your brain any more. That'll fuck with your head, that stuff will.
Dom? What are you?
Dom Wooganowski. Duh.
Bob, do you remember Mary?
I got twenty bucks says you're full of shit.
He can tell you're an animal nut. You are, aren't ya?
Here's the info you asked for.
Very nice.
Fuckin' animals. Hey, what do you say we go grab a couple drinks.
Yeah, well when you quit blow, you gotta quit the booze, too.
Here, just have one of these then.
Uh, I'm fine. Just wanted to let you know I'll have your car back in a couple hours, I'm still staking out this girl's apartment.
How'd you know that?
What are you doing with all these blueprints?
The hell with that. No one's gonna tell me who I can and can't work with.
That's what I said, so I went out and got him a leash you know, one of those clothesline runners for the backyard. He's got plenty of room out there to dig. The kid's really blossomed. Now I can take him to ball games, movies -- you know, happy stuff.
Fine. Fine.
Would you call that a portico or a vestibule?
And it doesn't cramp your style?
You know, sometimes I wish I could be like Magda and not go home. I'd like to just bounce around for awhile, do a little traveling...
No. But the Boston Globe critic Jay Carr hated it.
No, forget it, it was stupid.
Urrggghh...
Are you okay?
Hi, I'm out drinking champagne and roses... and I'm really happy. Leave a message. BEEP.
All you want is a phone number?
Thanks, Healy. Good work.
Miami?
But you said she was a sparkplug...?
Look, you asked me to follow your girl around, and I did and I started to like her, and then I realized I just couldn't in good conscience do it.
Pleasure to meet you, Patrick.
Yes yes, I did get my degree up there.
Well, I'll tell her I ran into you.
Really? But he's been married for twenty years -- they've got six kids.
Do you know the... soccer stadium?
No... just down the street, the Amigo Tower.
I'm a phony -- just like you, man.
I mean I'm a fucking fraud. I'm no architect. Don't be a putz -- who's been to Santiago twice in a year?  Estadio Olimpico -- please!
How many is that?
Sucks. So what's up? You some kind of salesman or something?
I see where you're going.
No, it should be 'a hockey player with great pecs.'
Yeah, Steve. Steve was all right for awhile.
I don't know, it was complicated. He's in San Francisco, I'm in Miami.  Besides, Magda's psychic dog hated him.
Have you been up all night again?
Neighborhood Watch? Is that what you call listening in on stranger's phone conversations?
Magda, Puffy barks at everybody.
I'm buying bananas tonight.
Magda!
Pat does projects all over the world.
Can I pour you one?
What's up?
What...?
Oh, are you on the team?
Ted, are you okay?
Oh my God... Ted.  What are you...? I can't believe this. I haven't seen you since --
I can't believe he remembered you. He never remembers anybody.  You know I tried to call you for weeks after that.
Jeez, Mary... I'm...
Why not?
Um, Ted, I need a moment with Magda -- would you let the dog out of the bathroom.
Get out.
But but what about Steve?
Get over here.
Just relax, dear. Now, um... what exactly are we looking at here?
No, no, please!
No! I was pissing!
We've been hailing the Groznyy for the last hour, Mr. Secretary. The Groznyy refuses to stop.
Yes, Captain, you may proceed. Clear your guns.
I believe the President made it clear that there would be no firing on ships without his express permission.
And it can be relayed beyond Comrade Khruschev's ears to the top circles of my government
With the caveat that it is not made public in any way, shape or form.  And we must have an answer tomorrow at the latest. I cannot stress this point enough.
He gets it, but he's pissed.
The other thing is...
Jesus...
Adlai can handle Zorin. He knows the inning and the score.
We're getting everyone together as fast as we can.
All right, so maybe we overestimated how reasonable this trade would look. Okay? You happy? So now what?
Christ, Ken, you know it's not that easy.
The sun came up today.
Every day the sun comes up... says something about us.
I am instructed to tell you that the American Government would respond favorably to an offer along the lines you have discussed. If this solution were raised at the U.N. by Ambassador Zorin, he would find a favorable reply from Ambassador Stevenson.
Yes. From the Highest Authority. There are two conditions. The U.N. must be allowed to inspect the removal of the missiles.
Is this the Chiefs' recommendation?
When are you going to be home?
What's happened?
What happens to you? I'm not leaving without you.
I want an hour with him.
There are major rail disruptions in the South, two airborne divisions are on alert. That exercise is an invasion.
Still think Cuba isn't important?
Should be here any minute.
We can horsetrade with Khruschev on ships. But it doesn't get us any closer to removing those missiles.
Don't take it to court, but we've got good circumstantial evidence...  Walter agrees. My gut's telling me Khruschev's turning to a trusted old friend to carry his message.
Moving the line. Stroke of genius.
You must think I'm blind and stupid. I've already gotten the birds and bees from Bobby. The President doesn't have to double-barrel me.
That may be why Khruschev's introducing this guy. We've been burned by his usual players in the formal channels, so he brings in an honest broker.
Yeah.
Jesus Christ, Larry, what the fu-- Larry. That's not even your name, is it? What's your real name, you fucking scumbag?
Mr. Clear Moon.
Now keep that between us, Dennis, cuz I don't know what kinda Johnny Law they got here.
What are you doing?
What's this about?
You think I killed him? Cuz he was an apple? Well, let me tell you something about Leo, Man --
Taking ol' Leo somewhere?
Nice piece. You come back here to cover your tracks, Geronimo? What's your name?
We got the wire ya was comin'. You're the Indian official, yeah?
-- an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Intimidation. I know that.
Somebody must be doing something somewhere in your jurisdiction, Officer Crow Foot.
Respect the dead, Hoss. Because when --
What the hell you doing?!
Hey, hey, hey. J. Edgar would've loved you. He'd love anybody who joined the bureau to, what was it? "To enforce the laws of my country and protect her interests"?
Meet me at base. Over.
Who is he?
She took something from the house. What she called a medicine bundle. Most likely Jimmy's.
Her oil pan is shot.
Your first homicide, that's gonna happen, Ray...
Bastards...
Eagle's claws and a bear's balls that's what her profile says.
Tread matches. It's the car.
And it was full of water when I drove by here three days ago. Full. I mean... a river.
Listen: when we get back tomorrow, you're gonna find Tully laying a promotion on you. S.A.C. He wants to prove that his yuppie agents are making good. He's offering you New York. Tell him you want Atlanta.
You ever put your hands on me again and you'll be doing the books for a baitshop in the fucking Everglades, Mister.
Ray...
Hey.  Hey, you, listen up --
To us Indians, our spiritual relatives are as close as family. I've got seven mothers on this reservation. Sisters. Brothers. You ain't one of them.
He sent me to find ya. He says he's got information.
What was he saying?
So what?
Was-te. 'Cept for one thing. Jimmy Looks Twice was nowhere near there. Ya see, when Jimmy was twelve years old, his mother and father was killed in a car wreck right down there near Elk Mountain.
Walter. When I fill out my 302, do I say that evil spirits are killing everybody on the reservation?
Take care of yourself, Walter.
Not no more.
Five-hundred year old turtleshell rattle...
Where's Maggie? Where'd ya take her.
What's that?
I thought it was a rare case of a brother getting a break in the courts. We did an honorin' song for him and everything.
This Jimmy's?
Who did?
Look. You and I can stand here in a culture clash til the sun comes up, talking about what's right and what's wrong. You're from the reservation. It's a different world.
I have a pick-up truck. No plates. Subject -- Indian -- entering suspect's house. Over.
No plates. No registration. Serial numbers removed. And all prints washed off by the river. That's great. This is turning out to be a walk in the park, do you know that?
I'm not that sure. Yeah, I think --
They said I'd never see FBI again, and I'm livin' with you fuckers. I don't feed ya information on the Warriors, it's back to the pen. I don't do this, back to the pen. Your word against my word. Against a con Indian's word. I really got a chance, man, right?
Keep talking, Yellow Bird...
Can I walk you out?She turns back to him, a smile.
It would have been really embarrassing!
Why not?
You seemed determined to do that anyway.. Why didn't you tell me you were a famous MiG insulter? MAVERICK Would it have made a difference?
That stuff about the MiG. I was out of line.
Harmless!
Why'd you do that?
That's it, of course. When I'm up there and doing it, I'm cheating it every second. I'm subverting all laws...gravity...whatever. I'm skating the edge of it.
What he said..."There's nothing so exhilarating as being shot at without result."
You're totally insane.
You want to go ballistic?
I always wanted to fly... ever since I first saw a jet. I wanted to fly jets, then I wanted F-14's, then I wanted to fly off carriers, then I wanted Top Gun.
Danger?
Doesn't it ever bother you?
Just good luck.
...they say you're alright.
The dark side. The price you pay for all the fun you're having. You knew about it, of course. Didn't you?
No.
I want it back.
What kind of games?
Strip reality! How do you play that?
You weren't gonna say goodbye?
Long distance? I wouldn't do that to you. I'd at least talk to you.
Hey, I never said I was a fighter pilot...I never claimed to think it was fun to be shot off the end of a ship in a storm. I can find contentment in a good book. I don't have to roar by someone at Mach two with my hair on fire. Sometimes...I just get happy being with the right man.
Well... What   is   it?
Yes, Sergeant?
We're locked on MiG ONE. Why doesn't he disengage?
Wait! Hell!..Something's wrong!
I'm pulling up.
WHAT? WHERE'RE YOU--HEY, WHERE IN THE HELL ARE YOU GOING?
If I could fly like you I'd have everything I want. If I could fly at all. I can't fly. I can't fly like that. Nobody can. Whatever it is, you've got it!
Don't WORRY!!!?   You've GOT it!!? Are you CRAZY?
Now have you got it?  Have you still got it?
Is there something I should know?
Slider -- they let you into Top Gun? If you're among the best in the Navy, I tremble for the security of this country.
You think you can stay up with us.
How was it?
Keller, Black Lion Squadron. I knew him at Pensacola. He's damn good.
You ever done this before?
Hey Mav, this is Sally. She doesn't believe a word I say. Tell her I'm married, will you?
We did it!
Come on, come on! It's double or nothing.. We're talking twelve bucks American, here.
What the hell is this?
Just cover Wood, Maverick. Mutual support, man!
Don't be greedy. Stay with Wood.
Man, you guys gooned it. Your laser butts are scattered across KANSAS.
I was a victim of circumstance.
She's kinky for flight suits--said that she'd never seen so many zippers--played with them all night. The noise alone kept me up.
He's the best you have. He's going Top Gun!
Well, he's going  and he needs someone to fly the plane.
But, Skipper, Cougar's been picked for Top Gun...He's the best of the best!
No, we...got our butts kicked.
I'VE GOT TWO MORE BOGEYS COMING IN AT FOUR O'CLOCK HIGH.
ENGAGING BANDIT 12 O'CLOCK.
GET OUT OF THERE, YOU'RE UNSAFE. GET OUT OF THERE.
IF YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN.
You're a hell of a flyer.  You can be my wingman any time.
Need a hint?
You won?!!!
Considering the company you're in, that's a pretty arrogant attitude.
Maverick... Where'd you get that call sign?
It's my own way. It works for me. I don't care about the rest of that stuff.
Skipper, sorry to bother you.
Or you can quit.
It's no disgrace, kid. That spin was hell. It would wreck anyone's confidence. You could be a good pilot again someday...
Sometimes it's luck, but in this case, he earned it... I served with your old man.
VF 51, the Oriskany. You remind me of him. You're just like he was, only better...and worse.
They waved him off. He thought he knew better. He hit the ramp.
What's wrong with this one?
First time on Mars?
Shut up and drive!
And if you wanna breathe, you gotta but his air.
Don't bother looking.  It's in your skull.
There you go, Mr. Brubaker.  Suite 610 in the East Wing.
Well, my boy, you're a hero.
You see, Quaid, none of my people could get close to Kuato.  The fucking mutants could always sniff us out.  So Hauser and I sat down and invented you: the perfect mole.
That's what we wanted you to think. The fact is, Hauser volunteered to become Doug Quaid. It was the only way to fool the psychics.
Come on, Cohaagen!  You got what you want.  Give these people air!
Perfect!...Get out of Sector G.  Now. Don't think.  Do it.
Bob?
What the fuck is going on here?!  You can't install a simple goddamn double implant?!
Okay, this is what we're gonna do. Renata, cover up any memory he has of us or Rekall.
What is it?
Richter!  Call from Cohaagen.
If we don't hand you over, everybody in the sector'll be dead by morning.
Yeah.
What, aliens?
I don't know.
I did?
Look at this shit.
I'm sorry.  Would you please rephrase the question.
Who?
It's not funny, Doug.  You dream about her every night.
Let's do it.
Honey, do you have to spoil a perfectly wonderful morning.
Sweetheart, we've been through this a million times.  You'd hate it on Mars. It's dry; it's ugly; it's boring!  --I mean, really, a revolution could break out there any minute.
Well...What do you say?
You are somebody.  You're the man I love.
What are you doing?
--I got a trip to Mars.
The hell you're not.
Clever girl.
I love you.
I don't remember you.
Hauser, you're lost your mind.
This is too weird.
So you dropped by to apologize?
Now what?
The first settlers are buried here. They worked themselves to death, but Cohaagen ended up with all the money. He built cheap domes and watched their kids turn into freaks.
Like what?
Cohaagen knows it makes air.  But the bastard won't turn it on.
What's wrong?
Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck.  She's getting some kind of strange readings on her things.
You guys all set?
What?  Well, for chrissake, we could have made a stand at our place!  We had food, water...
What the hell is that, anyway?
Knock it off, Burt!
What do you think?  Max firepower or...?
That's fine.  We've got some new things to teach them.
BACK OFF, BURT...!
I'll bet you're sorry the college ever sent you up here.
He'll never make it!  They're gonna get him!
You're really leaving, huh?
How many cows does it take to make a stampede?  Is it like three or more?  Is there a minimum speed?
You know, if you wanted, we could take a look at those seismographs for her.
So what if we just did it...today. Pack up.  Drive straight down to Bixby.  Get serious.
So?  That car wash pays good, and they're always looking.
So long, cactus!
Slick as snot and I'm not lying.
That means we're gonna be out here, like, in the dark.
Pham Van don't get his mitts on <u>this</u> for no measly fifteen bucks!
God, the live ones smell worse tan the dead ones.
You know, I hate to be crude, but I'm gonna have to take care of some business here.
Well, folks, what's the plan?
Don't he have a home to go to?
You're right, don't matter where they come from.
I'm gonna kick his ass!
Light it, man!  LIGHT IT!!
How's she doing?
Burt!  Heather!
Val, we're going to have to forget about the truck...
Come on.  Get away from it!
I don't believe this.  The phone is out!  Pham, your phone is out!
Ready?
What's it doing?
Listen, they only respond to vibration, right?  Couldn't we... distract them somehow?
...we had to lick his boots clean.
And the one on the right is the bullet you test-fired from Shu's gun?
You would have the court believe that these two bullets were fired from the same gun?
Or this -- is this a significant difference?
I will allow the witness to testify. With the understanding that your questions are confined to the area of Mr. Kim's modus operandi.
Look, I'm a lawyer and --
Not the whole time, of course. I --
Exactly what information led you to arrest my client just two-and-a-half hours after the shooting took place?
I don't venerate drug dealers, Roger. To the contrary.
Kim denied it. But he admitted the gun was his, and he got life. Seems to have been an okay prisoner for eight years, til the... incident with Duane Lindeman.
So an upstanding member of the Aryan Warriors wouldn't paint them on. They take those teardrops seriously -- they're badges of courage, of honor. Only their most vicious killer elite get to wear them...!
Goddam it... the little punk bests me again, I get thrown down and lectured at and where the hell were you?
I've heard from the last ballistics expert on the list. It's an even ten who say Shu's gun killed Jimmy Chin!
Eddie... it's one thing to compare Clyde Gruner to Jesus Christ. It's even okay to claim that Shu Kai Kim is just slightly holier than the Pope... as long as you don't really believe it!
I am. Eddie -- we've got nothing.
Eddie -- it's Art Esparza!
I think he hired Shu to kill Jimmy Chin... It wasn't a Chinatown gang hit -- Jimmy Chin and Art's wife were lovers! She just about told me...!
"The killer wasn't Chinese"... Cecil Stipe was right. .!
They're Chinamen who speak English. We call them informants.
Lemme guess. Some corporate V.P.'s banging his secretary over lunch and you have to focus your camera and plug in your little tape recorder.
Afraid of what?
Quite a bit you didn't tell me.
'lo, Cecil.
Edward T. Dowd.
I'm sorry if I've ruined your day, Mr. Reynard. But my client's had a rough eight years behind bars and --
Back in the Seventies I spent years putting away gangsters in a Colombian syndicate called "the Ochoa". These guys are very dangerous, Ed. When I hear that a small-time dope lawyer is conniving to spring one of these guys, I see red.
Yes, but that's not the issue. What's on your wish list, Ed? Pleading Kim out to first degree man on both homicides, with an agreed sentence of 15 to life running concurrent? Come on... What're you looking for here?
I see: He'd walk out next month.
You're pissing me off again, Ed.
Yes, Mr. Dowd.
You read Eddie's Chase Manhattan Bombing summation in the Leftist Law anthology?
What were you... Why were you at Shu's trial this afternoon?
Look. Mister --
Five years.
By "takes care of," you mean "kills".
And why was an exception made?
You're a l-lawyer?  I... I haven't had my meds, or m-my vital signs t-taken yet. I...
Yes, it's a great big psychedelic circus ride, isn't it, Cooper?
Let's test it for the record. Will the next victim be a man or a woman?
No... No, go away.
Go away. I am not talking to you.
No.
No. Never. You'll have to kill me.
This isn't Mike.  Is this Mike?
The stuff we got last night.
Don't get funny with me again.
Yeah, and I'm gonna need that ten thousand dollars back.
Your behavior is not funny and is wasting the time of the Federal Government.
Well, where are you going?
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond and Agent Sam Stanley. Sorry to disturb you, but we would like to see Teresa Banks' trailer, please.
You weren't kiddin'. This stuff's got the sting of the forty-eight hour blend.
GOT A MAP OF THE ENVIRONS OF THE YAKIMA INDIAN RESERVATION WITH YOUR NAME ON IT. BETTER BRING A POLE.
And no one found the ring?
He's dead -- good and dead.
He didn't suffer.
No.
You know, I never told anybody, but once for about three days, just before her time, Teresa's arm went completely dead.
That was really something.  That dancing girl.  What did it mean?
Sort of shorthand.
We're heading into a difficult situation.
Lil was wearing a sour face.
So the sheriff had got an Uncle who's committed a serious crime.
Why couldn't he have just told you all these things?
I see. He does talk loud.
No one could find those splinters without a machine like this. And no one had a machine like this.
Yes, it is good.  What do you think is in these other drawers?
Maybe, later we could take a look.
Geez, Agent Desmond, it's three-thirty in the morning. Where are we going to sleep?
No, Sam, I'm speaking plainly and I mean just exactly what I say.
Esthetics are subjective, aren't they, Agent Desmond?  I'm Sam Stanley. If you ever need me.
Noooo...
James called me last night looking for you.
Laura?
Laura, how about one friend for the rest of your whole life?
Do you want to talk?
You want a muffin?
What are you doing?
No.  I don't need to take this to be your friend.
How did I get in the house? How did I get into my bed?
Even this heavy work beats being at home with the old ball and chain.
Bob.
The diary was hidden too well. He's the only one who could know where it was. He's getting to know me, now. He's real. He speaks to me.
You're not Bob are you, Harold? If you are, you can kill me right now. Kill me right now, if you are.
I hate him, I hate it. Sometimes I love it. But now I'm afraid. I am so afraid.
Did you make me a tape?
Laura, you have to deal with all of this.
That's right. She called me. She even asked me what your fathers looked like...
Why? It does.
I've got to see you.
What's going on?
What do you mean?
Say anything you want... I know you love me and I love you.
No.
You'd think so.
Oh, I thought I saw you.
What are you doing?
I'm going to show you how to wash this tile and then you're going to do it.
You're right. There's no one here.
I know that answer. If we went to trial would we win?
...here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy...
...that was a Dr. David Gruber's office...
You are aware of the penalties for perjury...?
You would not...?
And wasn't that an oath...? These are your initials here: K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath. No less important than that which you took today.  Isn't that right?  Isn't that right...?
And why, please tell us, would you think that?
Engaged to render an opinion. For a price. Is that correct? You're being paid to be here today?
Uh-huh. Still practice a lot of medicine?
Answer affirmatively. Simply. Keep those answers to three words. You weren't 'part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist. Isn't that right?
Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse...
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
...the Archdiocese called up, they said who was our attorney, 'cause the case is coming to trial...
What is this going to cost?
You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up. Who do you think you are?  Who do you think you are...?
I swear to you I wouldn't have turned the offer down unless I thought that I could win the case...
If I could accept the offer right now, I would.  They took it back.
Yes. Yes. I think so. I hope you'll be comfortable. I'm putting you up at my...
I... given the limits of your question, that's correct.
Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance... she...
...she went in complaining of stomach cramps. Good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart.
Dr. Gruber...
Yes.
The hospital is owned by the Archdioceses of...
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
Thank you.
Yessir. I'm sorry.
What is it?
Listen to me, fella...
Exception!
D'you find an apartment?
Why?
A brick house says you divorced him. I'll put you on your honor. Bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for dinner. And I'll take your word for it. Now you tell me the truth. Because you cannot lie to me. What's your name?
Maybe I can do something right.
What happened...?
Not if you don't grow up...
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth. He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life. And we can prove that. What we don't know is why. What went on in there? In the O.R. That's what we'd like to know. Something went wrong. And you know what it was. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. What happened? The phone rang... someone got distracted... what?
I can subpoena you, you know. I can get you up there on the stand.
Who are you protecting, then?
You know how beautiful she was?  Her husband left her, and he took her kids... They, they, they'd let you die in there. They don't care. Nobody cares. The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care... in Arlington...? They'd take her in. Perpetual care. They'd take her. Fifty thousand dollars they want. An endowment.
My doctor told me that I got to move out West... that's when we filed in court. We didn't want to sue...
Are we going to win?  We have, you know, other tactics, though...
Come on. Let's get a drink.
Are you out of your mind...?
To do what...? To do what, for chrissake...? To help her to do what? She's dead...
Mick. Mick. Mick...
...he's a good man...
Who have we got?
John: gimme a cuesta-ray.
Yeah? How's our new witness?
How are you holding up?
Are you with me... are you awake...?
She didn't do anything. She took the patient's history and signed the charts. 'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...'
What are you doing in New York...?
We got a mistrial, you know. Joe -- did you hear what I said...?
I spoke to her, and everything is all right.
What?
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
But those notations stop...  ...Four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped.  And they resume seven minutes...
...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.  Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.
Looks almost cold now, don't it?
It's an enemy sneak attack.  Let's get outta here!
Hey, how about that!
That explains why communication is cut the moment their machines begin to move.
Mister Secretary - if they link up with those others near Fresno...
Hurry up!  Jump in!
The troops are certainly moving in here!
I just told them the local situation. Colonel Heffner's in full charge now.
We can't go into town - everybody's getting out of there!  I'll fly you over to Pasadena.
You'll hit something!  Can't you go higher?
I never noticed before - that's a cowboy tie....
We'll get safely out of here, don't worry.
He liked you ... I could bawl my head off!
Very futuristic.  Yours doesn't really go with that butch haircut!
How'd you guess?
That's what knocked the phones out, too.
That's their position?  You've certainly got them surrounded.  I suppose they've neutralized all communications here.
Thank you, sir.  If they start anything, we can blast them right off the earth!
That probably dropped half way to Pomona!...What do you think?
They don't do much of anything...!
Let's go back inside, Uncle Matthew.
I think somebody ought to check on it. Over.
Better'n a lion farm or a snake pit. We won't have to feed it!
Which means he's having nightmares again?
Can I read it?
Sweetie, you've got lots of fans, we've done market studies.  You rate right up there.  We've already got Chase working on a prototype for the glove.
Bob, how long has Wes been working on this script?
Just an earthquake, Dylan.  Every once in a while we get a few.
Anything other than the obvious bothering you?
What if it isn't over?
Just be careful, okay?
Guess so.
He was just acting very strange.  He thinks somebody's after him, Chase. It's scary, it scared me.  He was acting like...
Rex saved me.
Time for sleep.
I can't sleep there, Mommy.  Please!
You saw him, didn't you, Dylan!?
In what, a romantic comedy?
Heather?  You doing okay?
Darker.  More...evil?
I know what he's doing is bizarre, but most of the time he seems so normal, so well adjusted.  I just can't believe it's him.  I mean, and not something outside, influencing him.  Or is that how denial works?
Heather Langenkamp?
Is Chase Porter your husband?
Studio B.
Yeah, Julie, I'm sorry.  I just thought...there was an earthquake, I think.  Little one, but...
Like the Genie in the bottle.
Dylan.  And...  Chase.  My God, Wes, did you know?
Can I get you something to drink?
He would have loved this.
You sound so sure.
What?
Everyone aboard young Bill?
Raise the inner jib!  Raise the forestaysail!
Why wasn't I made aware of this Bill?
When we were growing up I always felt like you would take care of things, that everything would be okay.  But you can't make this okay, can you?
Look, meet us out front when you're through.  If they try to take anything away from you like Johnny Quest up there, just make a list and we'll have 'em send it down to the boat.
What the "Bowsprit Affair"?
She isn't that old.
They were gonna put me into special- ed this year.  I stole a copy of my transcript, changed all the grades. Shit, who am I kidding.  I'll never pass the boards.
Bregitta.  Do you believe it?
You okay?
Ninety-six.
I couldn't have done it without you.
You gonna jump?  Or are you just having a last look?
It's no my fault I was born first. Besides, nobody ever sent me on an eight month vacation, so ease up on the sad sack stuff.
I'm just not like you.  Ya know? I'm never going to go to Yale.  I'm never going to be "William".
He does.
Yeah, but how are you supposed to make the first move?
Can we talk?
You taking the order wouldn't have changed anything.
What the hell is going on?
How ya doing?
My parents don't do it anymore.
It works?
My brother.  He fell out of the old beech tree.  Broke his neck.  I was on a camp out.  They started going at it, throwin' things, a real knock down...  They didn't find him 'till the next morning.  They didn't even know why he was up there.
Well, spit it out.
Why do you think I'm sending him home?
But you invited is aboard.
Is that what you were trained to do?
I'm Francis Boutillier.  This is my son, Philip.
We'll do our best.  You're welcome to say goodbye.
Humor me.  Eat it anyway.
Spying?!
Oh, really?
I think you were too hard on Weathers.
Son-of-a-bitch.
And being sixteen.
They think we're carrying Cuban refugees.  Skipper, they mean to board us.
Hell, they even kicked me outa vo- tech 'cause I couldn't read a slide rule.
Because I felt like it.  What do you care?
How would you know?
Damn, Porkchop, you sound just like a guy who ain't never seen a pair.
I don't.
The rust won't wait for you to read Conrad, Goodall.
Tie it off!!
Terry left his passport in Curacao. We could hide him...
They're waving... handkerchiefs or something.
You're a day late.  We keep a schedule aboard ship.  Lives depend on it.  Hello, Philip.
Suicidal...
I'm not gonna kill it.
What are you blubbering about?
Don't look down.  Look in my eyes! Climb!  We'll do it together.
Sir, were you aware at any time of the use of alcohol among the crew.
Yes, that's true.
Yes, ma'am. What's on your almost- perfect mind this evening?
Meetin' him at the gate. That phone call this afternoon was the signal. My deranged mama's hid the keys to my car. But of course, I know exactly where they are.
Hey, pretty woman... Sailor here?
Hey... You gotta smell in this room of puke... You been pukin' in here, little girl? Huh?... You sick?... Pregnant?
You know, I really do like a woman with tits like yours that talks tough and acts like she can fuck like a bunny... Can you fuck like that?... You like it like a bunny?... Huh?... Cause baby, I'll fuck you like a real good like a big ol' jack-rabbit bunny... Jump all around in that hole... Bobby Peru doesn't come up for air.
Whisper it... Whisper "fuck me"... Whisper... Whisper... Whisper... Whisper...
Need a hand?
Whattaya mean family?
What is it?
Nice of you to drop by.
Ain't never had no girl pull a blade on me.
No shit?!?! You know him?
Club Zanzibar.
What'll it be? The regular? Black Label?
Alright... By all means. Make yourselves at home.
I thought you two were in Austin, Texas. Or Takes-us, as they say in these parts.
I'm sorry to do this to ya here in front of a crowd, but I want ya to stand up and make a nice apology to my girl.
In what capacity?
Why are you in New Orleans? If you don't mind my askin'.
You're just jealous of Santos cause he's sweet on me.
Johnnie, I can't tell you, honey. Is there anyway we can get on the road tonight? We've got to find them kids.
Who?... Uncle Pooch?...
Don't give me no trouble now, Pace, please. This ain't the easiest day in a long time. And what do you mean how are we gonna know what your daddy looks like? You seen his photo.
Heard grandpa Santos and grandmama talkin'.
Grandmama said how Sailor murdered a man.
Hey, my snakeskin jacket... Thanks, baby... Did I ever tell you that this here jacket for me is a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom?
I'd stand by you, Sailor... through anything.
That don't seem fair.
Musta been a lesson tellin' ya it was the wrong time... What did you do, your mama find out?
Actin' funny how?
One thing puzzles my mind, sugar... You're twenty years old - aren't you ever curious why your mama has this fixation on keepin' us apart? Puttin' a detective on us. I'll tell ya Lula... Well... It's more'n me killin' Bob Ray Lemon...
Sailor!
I'd got to the far end of the world for you, baby... You know I would.
...That's an awful long way to go, just to get some pussy.
Sorry, baby... When's the first time you done it with a girl who wasn't hookin'?
I'll drop mama a postcard from somewhere. I mean, I don't want her to worry no more'n necessary.
Okay, manslaughterer who's broke his parole and got in mind nothin' but immoral purposes far's you're concerned.
Life is a bitch and then you marry one.
I H-A-T-E hotel bedspreads. They don't hardly never get washed, and I don't like the idea of lyin' on other people's dirt.
What's that, honey?
Got you a pack of Mores again, huh?
I do.
I know. I kept walkin', I headed for your house, only it wasn't your house, really. You let me in only you weren't real pleased to see me. You kept askin', 'Why'd you come to see me now? Why now?' Like it'd been a long time since we'd seen each other.
Oh my God... It's Johnnie... Duck down!... Get goin'!
I'll be damned if I'm leavin'. That band is too good?
More'n likely.
You want me to drive for a stretch? Give you a chance to rest.
What's that, peanut?
I just figured you was out bein' Mr. Cool...
You knew my daddy?
God, Sailor... That's the night my daddy died.
They have, sugar.
She died right in front of me. Why'd she have to go and do that, Sailor?
Well, it ain't exactly Emerald City...
I'm gonna stay here in this room, Sailor. I don't feel so good? This heat makes me tired.
That you, Sail, honey?
I barfed. Tried to make it to the bathroom... Turned out it was the wrong door anyways... I sorta got it cleaned up.
Really, Sailor, it ain't nothin' against you. I love you.
I know. Just I'm sorta uncomfortable about the way some things is goin', and this don't help soothe me.
Who says I'm smart? You up to somethin' with Bobby Peru, Sailor?
He's a stone fuckin' criminal, honey, and you ain't.
Was a massacre. Soldiers there murdered old folks, women and babies, and dumped 'em in a trench. Bobby Peru prob'ly killed the most.
That man's a black angel, Sailor. You hook up with him, you'll regret it. If you live to.
You must be my son.
You hungry? Pace and I ain't had dinner yet.
I'm fine, mama. I just wanted to tell you not to worry.
No, mama, I'm in Mexico, and we're about to get on an airplane to Argentina!
Lula? I love you, baby. I just want you to be all right.
Call me again soon? I'll be waitin' by the phone.
Six.
Really, mama, I gotta go.
I'm afraid his car is gone, Mrs. Fortune.
I knew you'd want it again...
What do you want me to do about it?
You need to explain it.
Shoot him? Like with a gun?
Shoot Sailor in the head with a gun... Now I'm beginning to get it... You want me to shoot Sailor in the head with a gun.
Wrong! It's much better to blow a hole in the back of the head... right toward the bridge of the nose... Lots and lots of irreparable damage.
Why didn't you send Johnnie Farragut?
I got your message... But you went right to Johnnie, didn't you?... I can't trust you, bitch - not for one minute... Naughty girl... Sailor and Lula are headed west, and guess what? There's no turning back. I'm in a killing mood.
Santos... What's happenin' here?
...Sailor Ripley... Can I talk to Lula?
Oh, don't worry 'bout that...
He's fine. He's narrating.
Oh, well, that's just it. She's been coming down here, every half hour or so, to, sort of, check on me. If I'm not here, she might... call the police or... something.
No offense, Professor Tripp, but you look sorta crappy.
It's the Chancellor.
Well, I'm going to read it anyway.
Groom. Named Claudell. And his mother blames Vernon for his death.
Christ, Crabs, what do you expect me to do? The kid's practically in a coma.
Honestly, Tripp. Do you actually think I would sneak in here and read your book without asking you?
James? My James? What's happened?
Good God. Let's go rescue him.
Ah. Wait a minute. The university must know where he lives.
I've been doing this a long time, Tripp. I feel this kid in my bones.
Oh! Huh. Exactly how do we do that?
Let me get this straight. Jerry Nathan owes you money. So, as collateral, he gives you his car.
Christ, Tripp. How did you know?
Walter Gaskell isn't going to send James Leer to jail, Crabs. I know that.
I'll be... somewhere else.
I passed out.
I've been doing that a lot lately.
The last month maybe.
Spiro T. Agnew was vice president, I believe.
Look, Mr. Tripp. You have a drug problem, all right? On top of that, you have a bite on your ankle that is severely infected. We pumped you with antibiotics so you'll be fine, but another day or two and you might have lost the foot. As for your spells. I'm guessing they're a result of the anxiety you've been experiencing lately.
Better luck next time.
It's just a souvenir. They don't even make the caps anymore.
Boy or girl?
Right. Well, thanks. For the lift.
Goodbye, Grady.
Trust me, I understand. I just want to say something to you, Grady.
Listen, James, about this afternoon. In workshop. I'm sorry. I think I let things get a bit out of control.
Really? That's remarkable.
It's feels unreal, like butterfly wings or... something. It must've cost Dr. Gaskell a lot.
I'm sorry. Professor Tripp. Maybe it's seeing that jacket that belonged to her. It just looks... really lonely. Hanging there. In a closet. Maybe I'm just a little sad.
Professor Tripp? Can I ask you a question?
Trust me, James, when the family pet's been assassinated, the owner doesn't want to hear one of her students was the triggerman.
This is so embarrassing! You guys had to carry me out.
Oh.
The guy on the phone.
Yes.
But... ?
Washed up?
It's a hellhole. Three motels and a mannequin factory. My dad worked there for thirty-five years.
I'm telling you what I was told by my uncle. And he should know. He ran half a dozen men's clubs in Baltimore before he skipped town on a bad debt.
The one that left you?
Because you act like a goddamn spook all the time. Not to mention the fact that every last one of them is jealous of you.
Yes you are. My stuff stinks. I know it. You said so yourself.
But, last night...
You coming?
That's why you're having them. Your spells.
When?
I remember that. Five or six years ago.
Near Carvel?
James. This is my editor, Terry Crabtree.
I've been re-reading Arsonist's Daughter. It's so beautiful, Grady. So natural. It's like all your sentences always existed, just waiting around in Style Heaven, or wherever, for you to fetch them down.
And I love the inscription you wrote to me. Only I'm not quite the downy innocent you think I am.
So what are you going to do?
Look, Hannah. When you get him home... make sure he's all right. Before you leave. Okay?
That strikes me as odd.
All right. Take him to my place. He can crash on the sofa.
Listen, Hannah. You don't remember where that aunt worked, do you? James' aunt.
Actually, He's not the Chancellor's -- What?
Jesus.
Crabtree? He doesn't even know James.
The aunt, Hannah. Where did you take James that day?
Easy there.
New?
You go first.
Emily left me this morning.
My God, I wear the same scent as a transvestite. She IS a transvestite, isn't: she?
Has he asked to see the book yet?
Well, no, I don't see any way.  And I know how hard it is for you to -- to lose this chance.
Your fingerprints were all over the bedroom.
I'm not very happy with you right now, Grady. But more importantly, Walter's not very happy and he's gotten the police involved. They seem to think James Leer is somehow responsible for all of this. You wouldn't happen to know where James is, would you, Grady?
And the jacket?
And what do you think you might have said?
I'm through improvising.
Did you just make that up?
Couldn't he have just thrown a shoe at the poor thing?
Like most editors, he really wants to be a writer, but he's too busy living a novel to bother writing one.
That's nice. All we have is a Japanese beetle trap.
It's three-thirty, Grady.
What is it, Grady?
No. I guess you're here for the backpack.
Say, Professor Tripp, is all that stuff true about Errol Flynn? How he used to put coke on his dick. To make himself, you know, like, last longer?
Oh, right. Yeah, that's true. He used to rub all kinds of things on it. Paprika. Ground lamb.
Holy shit. Are you serious?
Maybe I should read it.
Where's Emily, Hank?
Listen, Hank, I'm sorry about all this. I didn't come here to upset you and Irene. I want you to know that.
One other thing. About this kid, this student of yours -- Leer -- James Leer. You wouldn't know how I could get in touch with him, would you?
Well, Q certainly will. And, given that he will be addressing 500 people in little over an hour...
You look good, damn good, considering you're an old man now!
Foreman now.
Then what? What?!
Fucking Mariners.
I've got some good news.
Aren't you glad?
Anna will be away at camp. The house will be quiet. It's better when it's quiet.
C'mon, Walter.
You're a good man, Walter. Okay, you did some wrong things, but inside you're a good, decent man.
I get horny as hell for other women.  I mean I fantasize about raping some beautiful woman.
I'm just talking, man.
It's crazy out there.  Young girls wearing mini this and mini that. Sometimes when I walk down the street and pass some sexy looking woman, she makes me feel like I'm bothering her. She stares down like she's afraid to look at me. Why she do that? Why can't she look me in the face?
What are you looking at?
What are you writing in that book?
And when you sit by the window, watching the girls in the little cotton skirts parade by, do you wave your wanger at the girls? Is that when you jerk off?
Your ivy. Too much direct sunlight. These plants don't like a lot of sun.
You walked home.
You knew her?
You don't know?
I'll be asking the questions.  Last night, you hear anything unusual? Screams? Shouts?
I wasn't feeling well.
That's a nasty scratch on your neck.
The passionate one?
I'd keep away from him.
Banished... yeah.
How do you know?
And how's your job?
Why not?
Oh. It never crossed my mind.
I thought a journal would encourage you to reflect.
How's the journal?
But you don't like coming here. Be honest, Walter.
Good. That's an honest answer. And why don't you like coming here?
Maybe it's the way I look. Or the sound of my name.
How do you feel about that?
Have you talked to Carlos about your concerns?
Why do you think you're here?
I want to be normal!
When did it all start?
To relax.
No. When I say the word "pretty," when I say the word "pleasure," what is the earliest memory you see?
Who do you see?
Where?
Where are you?
What the hell are you doing there?
I don't like nobody behind my back!
Walter, what did you do while taking a nap with your sister?
What else?
There's something wrong with this picture.
What's weird about that?
You never spoke to me before.
Is that a school?
What about bears?
They could eat you.
So?
Hey, that was... intense.
I thought I'd stay the night.
Hey, there.
I never hurt them. Never.
Get your kicks somewhere else.
What was prison like?
And what do you tell yourself now?
Being here, with me.
Maybe this isn't a good idea.
You're scared.
I say we call it quits.
I don't need a plant.
What's going on?
I heard they were filthy birds.
She went front-office on you.  Tighten that for me, right there.  That's it.
What are you still wearing that for?
Jammer saw something in there, something that scared the hell out him--
All I'm saying is when you're hanging on by your fingernails, you don't go waving you arms around.
He's got the shakes?
You totaled it, huh?
Well, that's that.
Son of a bitch!
Just get around so your lights are on the hatch.
No, I mean it.  Those SEALs aren't telling us diddly.  Something's going on.
That's Perry.
Do we just leave him there?
Go to the infirmary... get the cart .. oxygen... de-fib kit... adrenaline in a... ten cc syringe... and some... heating blankets. You got all that?
He's convulsing!
Cat, you tie onto this manifold.  There's some tanks on the other side; I'm gonna go check them out.
I think they're from 'you know'.  Some place that has similar conditions... cold, intense pressure.  No light.
Those guys ain't so tough.  I fought plenty of guys tougher'n them.
That thing was probably their version of Big Geek... like an ROV.
Lady, we better fish or cut bait.
Cab Three, check.  Right behind you.
No.  Just you and me.  We get some proof, then tell them.  Hippy, look... if was can prove to Coffey it's not Russians, maybe he'll ease off the button a little.
Schoenick... your Lieutenant is about to make a real bad career move...
Hey!
Stand by on the ROV.
But your friend is waiting downstairs.
When do you have to go back?
I'd like to find a place where I can get some peace and rest, maybe around here somewhere. I'd like to try...
In this case, getting married means nothing. Aren't we already the same as being married? And Corrado and Giulia -- aren't they already the same as being married?
Used to what?
I presume by this method that you'll be able to uncover some new clue, either a handkerchief or an article of clothing... In other words, something which your men have not been able to find as yet.
Allow me to inform you that my daughter is not a fugitive.
It couldn't have come from anywhere else. At least, somewhere from that vicinity... But I really can't understand it. Contraband cigarettes on that island! It's the first time that ever happened.
But how could we...at a time like this when we just... well, let's at least first have a look around the other islands. Could be that something might turn up there.
There's no comparison.
Somebody must live here!
Don't be so humble.
Twelve years ... But why haven't they married?
I'm beginning to have my doubts. It couldn't be that they're in love?
Find anything?
Where are you going?... To Montaldo's?
Oh, Sandro...
Let's get out of here, fast... This is not a town, it's a cemetery.
Does it please you to say such things?
Then why do you say them?
Did the hotel manager speak to you about that place nearby?
Good night, my love.
Well, with a shark running loose around the place, I for one won't get aboard that raft! They'll have to catch it first. I want to see it right here before my feet, dead or alive.
Tell me, Claudia, what do you think of Raimondo?
He amuses me. I don't know of anything more amusing. Outside of this jigsaw puzzle. Don't you find it so, Claudia?
I'm going with the patrol boat to make a tour around the islands.
Shouldn't we try to find a quieter place?
How do you manage to put up with all this confusion? You always said people bore you.
My childhood, instead, was a very sensible one.
Now what do I have to do to be left in peace?
Why didn't you ask me to go with you?
Looks like the weather is changing.
And what are we going to do now?
Giulia...
But where did you come from?
Patrizia, what are you going to do?
Your mother?
Who knows?... Another one has it that she entered a store in Troina. This information comes from the storekeeper himself who stated that such and such a girl had bought I don't know what in his store... at Troina.
About fifty miles or so. If you want, I'll give you the name of the storekeeper.
Because I'm getting fat.
I do, I have to be attractive to God.
No he doesn't. He hates fat people.
That's because they're suffering... suffering is beautiful, I want to be beautiful.
No... I mean... I mean look at these. I've got to lose weight, I'm a blimp.
But she watches... she listens.
I'm not hungry.
Of God.
It made them uncomfortable. And if they didn't sleep well I'm certain the next day they were cranky as mules. Sister where are your sheets?  Do you really believe that sleeping on a bare mattress is the equivalent of sleeping in a coffin?
A few years ago one of the Sisters came to me in tears, asking for comfort, comfort because she was too old to have any children. Not that she wanted to, but once a month she had been reminded of that possibility.
What do you mean?
No I'm not.
Second thing that comes to your mind.
Have you ever loved anyone?
Well, who in particular?
Who?
Where do you meet?
Yes.
No... no, I don't want to answer any more questions.
Would you like to be?
Do you have any children?
You have trouble sleeping?
How would that person get one if they didn't want one?
Agnes, I don't believe you know nothing about sex...
What did you do?
You can tell me.
Yes?
And that you're stupid?
How does she know that?
Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say? Of course you do. Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say?
Agnes, you're stupid.
And why am I here?
Good. Would you like to tell me why you're here?
Of telling you.
How did you have a baby?
Did anyone else know about the baby?
Oh don't be, I'm here. It's alright. I want you to tell me what you did before you went to bed.
Hm hmm. What did you have for dinner?
My bed.
For me to get sick in.
Yes.
So I could go to him.
I hate him...
I hate him for what he did to me.
Mother Miriam was with you wasn't she?
You saw it all didn't you?
And then... what did she do?  Agnes what did she do?
H... how?
Are you dictating my position to me? We're getting into some sticky legal territories here.
Here you are. Don't let anyone know where you got them.
Larry...
I don't know.
Larry...
Maybe there's something that's not in the report that should be.
Thanks.
No, no, no...
No!
It's your favourite...
Marie's dead Mama.
Oh, we own the land around here. But we rent it out. We keep a few acres for ourselves,  some wheat, corn, some vegetables.
No. We work the land alone. No-one but Sister Marguerite and I are permitted contact with the public.
Why do you call it an investigation? I never have.
But what you believe makes no difference to us whatsoever Doctor. But it does make all the difference to Agnes.
I'm afraid the word brings up the most unpleasant connatations in this day and age...
What's his name?
Yes, but that was some ten months ago. I fail to see that the identity of that somebody has anything to do with this trial.
Because she's an innocent. She's a slate that's hasn't been touched except by God.
I've already told you what I thought.
That's absurd!
This convent is locked solid. The only one that has a key is Sister Marguerite and she wouldn't let Christ in after dark.
Not simple, no.
Catholicism is not on trial here. I want you to deal with Agnes without any religious prejudice or you turn this case over to someone else...
I'm only interested...
What good would it do. No matter what you decide it's either the... the prison or the nut house and the differences between them are pretty thin.
Visitors to the convent.
When was that?
Do you know what she did to her?
There is more here than meets the eye isn't there?  Lots of dirty little secrets.
An unhappy woman...
Because I am a moral person.
Who said anything about the Catholic Church...
Do you think they ever existed?
The hypnotism. Do you still disapprove?
May I be present?
I've just met with the bishop. We're taking you off the case.
If we want to hire a psychiatrist for Agnes. we'll find our own, thank you.
But what you are choosing to believe is a lie because you won't face the fact that she was raped... or seduced... or that she did the seducing.
For what?  An abortion?
You tied the cord around its neck.
I doubt that's what she'd say.
Oh, don't do this!
Of course, John.
The usual ten per cent?
They're yours.
Oh don't be so stroppy!
You heard, it gets on my wick.
Yeah, I've blown school out.
Yeah, that's right, they was supposed to come with us but they chickened.
Yeah.
Why aren't you at work?
Well, that's it, two minutes to the final run-through... they're bound to miss it...
Boys, you don't know what this means to me. If you hadn't come back it would have been the epilogue or the news in Welsh for life.
If you so much as breathe heavy on them, I'm out on strike.
That's right retreat behind a smoke screen of bourgeois cliches. I don't go round messing about with your ear-phones, do I?
Would you like to be a little more precise, sir?
Ever seen one of these before?
Me? Why?
I don't snore.
Eh, Ringo, do you know what happened to me?
Make a note of that word and give it to Susan. I think it's rather touching really. Here's this kid trying to give me his utterly valueless opinion when I know for a fact within four weeks he'll be suffering from a violent inferiority complex and loss of status if he isn't wearing one of these nasty things. Of course they're grotty, you wretched nit, that's why they were designed, but that's what you'll want.
Get him out of here!!
Oh, listen to teacher's pet.
Eh, I don't know if you realise it, but ...
Well ... come on.
Oh, Paul, you can't have your own way!!!
It's happened at last, we've become a limited company.
Hello, he's not talking to me. He's having a sulk.
Oh, it's the way you talk.
Oh, you're the understudy, sort of thing?
But that's not like a real person at all.
What are you?
Ah.
Can you now? Aah ... sheeps' heads! You learn more by getting out there and living.
And that lot's never happier than when they're jeering at you ... and where would they be without the steady support of your drum beat, I'd like to know.
You're only right.
Shush! Have they roughed you up yet?
Keep your voice down, this lot'll paste you, just for the exercise. Oh they're a desperate crew of drippings and they've fists like matured hams for pounding defenceless lads like you.
I'm soldier of the Republic, you'll need the mahogany truncheon for this boyo. A nation once again.
Would you two like a cup of tea?
Anything to spare?
That little old man.
Eh, he's a nice old man, isn't he?
I hope he fell off.
Gaw, it's depressing in here, isn't it? Funny...  'cos they usually reckon dogs more than people in England, don't they? You'd expect something a little more palatial.  Come on. Let's have a little action. Let's do something, then.
Don't move, any of you. They've gone potty out there. The whole place is surging with girls.
You've got a midnight matinee.
Oh, wait a minute, don't tell me you're ...
My eyes are lighter.
And my nose...
It's all over the place, everyone knows.
Mind you, I stood up for you, I mean I wouldn't have it.
Have <U>you</U> lost him?
He belongs to Paul.
None for me, then?
Oh dear, I feel like doing a bit of work.
Stop picking on him.
Look after him.
Do I have to raise me voice?
Yeah, you want to watch it.
Yeah, down the ... er ...
... as they head up for the show. Oh yes, well I mean it'ud be a pity to miss the show, wouldn't it like.
What is he?
Oh... God... am I cold...
If there is some kind of alien intelligence down on that planetoid, it'd be a serious mistake for us to blunder in unequipped.
Engines off.
Good!  Maybe we'll be able to see something then.
I don't recognize that constellation.
Any rotation?
Gravity?
I'm sending.  Do you hear me?
Appears to be a door hanging open, the entrance is clogged with debris.
I'll go first.
This is Chaz.
What's up?
Don't you remember?
Yes!
Well, get started.
What do you mean?
But we can't kill it.  If we kill it, it will spill all its body acids right through our hull and out into space.
We could cut a section out of that metallite netting.  It won't hold up to that acid, but aside from that it's pretty strong.
What happened?  Where's Sandy?
And then we run out of food and oxygen.
And when will you be ready to do that?
This dust is getting clogged in the intakes again!
Hey, are you guys still there? What's going on?
God, that smoke's poisonous!
It's a crude symbolic language -- looks primitive.
We can't go into hypersleep with that thing running around loose.
Well, those things out there aren't the same, you know -- the spaceship and the pyramid.  They're from different cultures and different races.  That ship just landed here -- crashed like we did.  The pyramid and the thing from it are indigenous.
Listen, it sure didn't like this flamethrower.
But they don't know about the translation!  They could be in danger right now.
What's happening up here?
That must have been when he got it.
What common objects?
Recognizable!  In that?
... And Broussard got caught in their reproductive cycle.
This should do it.
If you press the button right now, it will blow the whole nose of the ship off.
First contact...
Just settle down.  Sandy, you get any response yet?
Air lock?
What'd he say?
And what do we do when we find it?
I've got Hunter... and something else as well, in front of him.
Okay.
10% argon, 85% nitrogen, 5% neon... and some trace elements.
Still worried?
Here, Chaz.
Chaz -- what happened to Broussard?
I understand why you did that.
Take us up.
Where are you?
Can you make out any pattern in all that?
But the lifeboat can't accelerate to light speed.
So what do we do?  Do we ignore it and finish loading the explosives into the boat -- or do we flush it out now?
Kill me...
Better?
Let's get back and call this in.
Nice howitzer you've got there.
What do you need?
Curious thing is, the mass detector says they're too small to carry a deep-space drive.
It's too late!
Auto-shop's sealed, but those boys are cut-off.
Oh, man...
Ah, quit griping.  Keeps you in shape doesn't it?
There's no way a rhino'd survive that drop.
Forget it, man.
What the hell are you doing?
Alright, okay.  Look...
Still got him?
Secondary fluidic shunt for the sewage system.  I found the grating ripped right off.  The little fucker was strong.
Is this the suit?
Hey, Jan.  See if you can get someone to check out the chopper.
And...?
Everything on this module is locked and sealed.  We've lost 'B', 'C', and 'E' wings, but 'E' was the only one we didn't manage to totally evacuate.
There's still time to back-out.
Thanks.
Sorry.  Two green enabling buttons...
Yeah.  Somebody won.
I've found Ackland!
That's the wrong way!
I can... feel it moving around inside me. You've got to kill me.
Where'd you leave them?
'Bout five minutes.
May I come in?
Of course your performance was no surprise to me. After the other day I regarded it as no more than - a promised fulfilled.
A revolutionary approach to the Theater. However, if I may a suggestion...
After you change, if you're not busy elsewhere, we can have supper.
San Francisco. An oasis of civilization in the California desert. Tell me, do you share my high opinion of San Francisco?
Hungry?
Just like that, eh?
What time?
Addison...
Lloyd Richards is commercially the most successful playwright in America-
What do you mean by that?
Belong - to you? That sound medieval - something out of an old melodrama...
I had to get in, to meet Margo! I had to say something, be somebody, make her like me!
I don't think I'm going.
No, it's not.  It's for this.
This must be, at long last, our formal introduction. Until now we have met only in passing...
Claudia dear, come closer.  This is Max Fabian. He is a producer. Go do yourself some good.
In my case it's necessary. Too many taxi drivers write plays.
Then stop being a star - start treating your guests as your supporting cast!
I was there. An eyewitness.
I distinctly remember striking your name from the guest list. What are you doing here?
Margo, as you know, i have lived in the Theater as a Trappist monk lives in his faith. I have no other world, no other life - and once in a great while I experience that moment of Revelation for which all true believers wait and pray. You were one. Jeanne Eagels another... Paula Wessely... Hayes - there are others, three or four. Eve Harrington will be among them...
It wasn't reading, it was a performance. Brilliant, vivid, something made of music and fire...
Nothing?
Is it sabotage, does my career mean nothing to you? Have you no human consideration?
Oh well...  ... look through the wigs, maybe it got caught-
Can't keep his eyes off my legs.
The lack of pretense, that sort of strange directness and understanding-
Don't get stuck on some glamour puss-
You're not such a bargain, you know, conceited and thoughtless and messy-
Kid stuff or not, it doesn't happen every day, I want to heat it - and if you won't say it, you can sing it...
It's a good thought.
Need any help?
Don't let me kill the point. Or isn't it a story for grownups?
Thank you.
The audition.
What fire and music?
Addison-!
Poor little flower. Just dropped her petals and folded her tent...
You're being terribly tolerant, aren't you?
No, I'll tell it to you! For the last time, I'll tell it to you. Because you've got to stop hurting yourself, and me, and the two of us by these paranoiac tantrums!
Don't be condescending.
I admit I may have seen better days, but I am still not to be had for the price of a cocktail - like a salted peanut.
It's only for the license. There's a three-day wait - blood tests, things like that...
Groom-  - may I have a wedding present?
Yes, dear.
A cowboy.
Why?
Yes. Yes, it does.
- and for you.
The bed looks like a dead animal act. Which one is sables?
Bill says actors out there eat just as infrequently as here-
How do you do, my dear.
She, too, is a great admirer of yours.
You bought the new girdles a size smaller. I can feel it.
She's loyal and efficient-
You all put together?
There's some loose characters dressed like maids and butlers. Who'd you call - the William Morris Agency?
The caterer had to back for hors d'oeuvres-  Voila.
What are you doing here?
I hid outside in the hall till the maid came to turn down your bed. She must've forgot something and when she went to get it, she left the door open. I sneaked in and hid till she finished. Then I just looked around - and pretty soon I was afraid somebody'd notice the lights were on so I turned them off - and then I guess, I fell asleep.
About how you live, what kind of clothes you wear - what kind of perfume and books - things like that. You know the Eve Harrington clubs - that they've got in most of the girls' high schools?
That's the door.
So there you are. It seemed odd, suddenly, your not being there...
Why should you be? After all, six nights a week - for weeks - of watching even Margo Channing enter and leave a theater-
I'm going to take you to Margo...
There isn't another like you, there couldn't be-
Hello, Miss Channing.
Good night, Eve. I hope I see you again soon-
Mrs. Richards.
No, dear. Margo must go on.  As a matter of fact, I see no reason why you shouldn't be Margo's understudy...
I think she would cheer.
I've got a lot to say. And none of it is easy.
Oh, but there is-
In a way. You find yourself trying to say what you mean, but somehow the words change - and they become his words - and suddenly you're not saying what you mean, but what he means-
Tell me. How did your lunch turn out - with the man from Hollywood?
But the raves about your performance-
Eve. I - I don't think you meant to cause unhappiness. But you did. More to yourself, perhaps - as it turned out - than to anyone else...
You want to play "Cora." You want me to tell Lloyd I think you should play it.
Please, don't misunderstand me, Mr. Richards. I think that part of Miss Channing's greatness lies in her ability to choose the best plays... your new play is for Miss Channing, isn't it, Mr. Richards?
Ain't it the truth?
Well... there's one indoors now. I've brought her back to see you.
Margo, really...
I just never think of Lloyd as anywhere but indoors and anything but sitting down.
Do you want it on?
Why should he - and why should you?
Not to you. Not to Bill.
Margo.  Margo, I want you to know how sorry I am about this...
With tears?
Now let's not get into a big hassle-
Lloyd, what happened...?
Margo, again...
It's just possible she didn't...
It's going to be a cozy weekend.
I just don't want Margo to miss her train. As it is, she'll barely make the theater...
She wanted to explain about her interview, wanted to apologize to someone - and didn't dare face Margo...
Margo Channing has not been exactly a compromise all these years, half the playwrights in the world would give their shirts for that particular compromise!
Well of all-
Three days, that's for the bourgeois - I see a midnight elopement, waking up a village person...
After all, maybe she just wants to apologize...
What's so funny?
How about calling it a night?
You disapprove of me when I'm like this, don't you?
When you do, let me in on it.
I thought you knew... She was put on over a week ago-
I'm sure.
I mean, among other things, that it must have been a revelation to have your twenty-four-year-old character played by twenty-four-year-old actress...
You've been talking to that venomous fishwife, Addison deWitt-
You knew when you came in that the audition was over, that Eve was your understudy! Playing that childish game of cat and mouse...
You have a genius for making barroom brawl out of a perfectly innocent misunderstanding at most!
"Liebestraum."
Make it Bergdorf Goodman... and now everything is on its proper shelf, eh, Max? Done up in little ribbons. I could die right now and nobody'd be confused. How about you, Max?
Margo. You by any chance got bicarbonate of soda in the house?
Well, if she can act, she might not be bad. She looks like she might burn down a plantation...
--what do you think?--
That was fun.  What now?
Goddamnit--
See her?  Get anything?
And?--And?--
Who's first?
I don't get it... this really was my turf...
I hate both parties.
Republican?
'68.
It goes very high--we've got to find out where--
How do you want to handle Sloan?
--there had to be a White House overseer--
--if we could name the guys got the reports, we'd be ahead again--
--I know a lawyer at Justice--
Dwight Chapin, Nixon's appointments chief--he knew Segretti in school. Maybe I'm crazy, but this is the first time any of this starts to make sense. What were the three theories?
What would you have done?
You think we're being set up?--Christ, Deep Throat tells you last night that the letter came from inside the White House and up traipses Marilyn naming names.
Nah.  Maybe.
--Jesus--
What does it say?
I'll never get out of here in time.
Sure. Him I liked, he was a very nice person. Secretive too, traveled all over, but a decent man.
None of it was my idea, Carl--I didn't go looking for the job.
--you got more than one source?--
Speak.
--and we got a guy in Justice--
I thought you guys were supposed to be working on this story--  --you think I like being aced out?
--Bernstein, are you sure on this story?
I think.
I thought you had to get to Miami.
--you don't really think you're being followed?
We don't tell anyone that. Which is why you can talk to us. And if we can't verify what you say someplace else, we don't print it. That's another reason you can relax.
There are too many people watching me--they know I know a lot--
There were a group of them--I think five, I don't know their names.
Why couldn't you have just dialed me from the office, Irwin?
But they both worked at the White House?
--I'm not your source on that--
--if we wrote a story that said Haldeman controlled the fund?--
--well shit, we oughtta be tense-- we're about to accuse Mr. Haldeman who only happens to be the second most important man in America of conducting a criminal conspiracy from inside the White House--  --it would be nice if we were right--
What's this?
I got Clawsen on hold--
Did you know to come because one of the other men involved in the break- in called you?
The twenty-five thousand dollar one.  The one with your name on it.  In Bernard Barker's Florida account.  Bernard Barker, the Watergate burglar--
Because the press stinks too--history on the run, that's all you're interested in.  You come up with anything?
Go on.
I hope you noticed how coolly I behaved under the threat of discovery.
Of course--my God, you think something this big just happens? The break-in and the cover up, of course Mitchell knew, but no more than Ehrlichman.
How grand?
--I know, I know, the pressure's off the White House and it's all back on the Post--
Your name, please.
Where?
--correction--when you were drinking your lunch at the bar of the Sans Souci--
Ask him what he's really saying--he means take the story away from Woodstein and give it to his people at the National Desk--
...go on, go on...
Mr. John Mitchell, the head of CREEP, says it means nothing.  "...This man and the other people involved were not operating on either our behalf or with our consent. These is no place in our campaign or in the electoral process for this type of activity, and we will not forget it or condone it."
--in other words, you got nothing, you're thumbsucking.
That was awhile ago.
What do you think Mrs. Graham wants to see me for?
The report on the cash in Maurice Stans' safe, the three hundred fifty thousand, that's true?
Colson's too smart to get directly involved with something like that.
I can't say anything, I'm sorry.
You work there, Miss Abbott.
What the hell was that?
I'll do it.
Christ!  I didn't say you were out of the game!
What did you just say?
Alright, well...you've got to tone it down.  You don't need to go to Lookout Point and spout cheeseball lines to be romantic.
I'm three sheets to the wind, ma'am!
I mean it really bothers me when people try to pigeonhole me like that.
Come on!  I won't tell.
Hi...
Well, I mean, business is okay, and lacrosse is awesome, but what am I gonna be, a pro lacrosse player?  I really have no idea.
...I've got this lacrosse game.  It's really important, it's our last game. And you know, Central almost beat us last time, so I really want to kick their ass, and it's like cool because we're gonna get to play at State, which means that after the game I might be able to stop by...
This isn't the best way to proposition me.
This isn't any better, Chris.
Jessica, can you drive me home?
No.
I don't want to dupe her, Jessica.  If I say it, I have to be sure I mean it.
Thanks.  It was my idea.
And you said...
There's our man.
Gotta go.
That's what we are, we keep each other on track.  Prior to this day, we've postured.  We've procrastinated. We've pretended.  We've -- well I can't think of other p-words, but we've probably done them too.
Yeah, it's like tradition or something.
Holy shit.
You're not...busy?
Yes.
Dad.
Hold on.  You have no idea why I'm angry?
Yeah, that's pretty much it.
What was your name again?
Stifler's mom got it in the divorce.
That is a <u>nasty</u> story!
Okay, I get it.
Ooh, here's an easy one:  "Attractive SWF, fun loving and a youthful mind seeks outgoing companion." Okay..."Attractive"...ugly.
Hey, you did better than I did, Nova.
Hey guys, you came to watch me in action?
Yes.  No.  Yes.
So you need to change, right?
SUCK ME, BEAUTIFUL!
Ho-lee shit.
It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky. You got in.
So, do you want to be -- I mean, how do you want to do it?
Yeah Vick?
Kevin, next year...with you in Ann Arbor, and me in Nashville...it's not gonna work, is it.
Vicky...last night...I wasn't lying.
Then she said -- she loves me.
Dude, it's not like I haven't been trying to get laid.
So, I'm thinking prom is basically our last big chance.
Dammit, Kevin, what's with the attitude?
...Guess what?
I guess we'll call you two-ply.
You coming to party tonight, Ostreicher, ya fuckface?
Yeah right.  I got an idea for something new.  How 'bout you guys actually locate your dicks, remove the shrink wrap, and fuckin' use 'em.
What the fuck are you doing here?
Hey, you know, what can I say, I dig those cute little sweaters she wears.
Really?
You know.  If we hook up, tomorrow I'll just be some girl you go telling all your friends about.
Wow. You know Kung Fu or something?
Face it boyfriend. This is really happening.
Okay... dead or undead... what do you want from me?
Oh fuck, you are his nephew...
Sure. I can follow that.
Salots! Shitfucker!
You were. I have work to do. The publisher wants the transcripts by Monday. Go. Make yourself at home.
What good can you do? Why are you being so fucking stupid?
Like I should talk. Monsieur foot-in- the-mouth. I'm really sorry about that whole Woody Allen thing...
This looks familiar...
They're coming!
Are you crazy!?
You made me go there. I tried to stop you! You wouldn't listen!
I know where he'll go.
What does it say?
These tunnels must loop around and connect.
There's something down there! A bear or something! A god damn monster! Beau coup teeth! Huge, Grande, with yellow eyes, all this hair, it killed Serafine! My God...
It's you. You should be dead in that wreck with Bazin and Racine!
What's the problem?
Do you think I'm an idiot?
Ha. Some wonder drug...
We know you were with her.
That's not all...  Marcel - Officer Boulard was following you.
What?
Andy...
You're exactly right, Andy. I enlisted both Serafine and your uncle to obtain ADM. And now I'm counting on your assistance too.
Great. Later on we'll have to get together for cocktails. Right now I kinda have to hurry before I grow a lot of hair and eat people.  Say this heart thing works. What's it got to do with ADM?
Undead. Right. Sort of an ectocosmic manifestation. What a pisser. Tell you one thing though, Timothy Leary will be jealous as hell.
Jesus...
Not too well. He taught at the Sorbonne, right? Dad always calls him his "hippie brother". Did some work with Timothy Leary I think, and - Is he... is he going to die?
Maybe we should go now. You must be very tired. We'll call if any new -
Yeah. I guess so.  Did he say anything? Before the coma?
Andy, stop! I think he can help you -
What've you got?
Now!
Merde.
Here.
I thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore.
Where is your home, Anya?
Providing travel papers is illeagal!  I know Dmitri well - perhaps I can help you.  Providded you have enough money to pay for this service. . .
Noooo....
You never thought of the possibility?
You said you wouldn't laugh!
I know I must have had something to do with the palace - I've had little flashes of things - but being the Princess? It doesn't matter as long as I find my home.
Anya, wait!
Dmitri?
Who are you, child?
Anastasia! It was just a bat! It's gone, dear...
Don't you, child?
Dmitri didn't want the money?
Why does everyone have to act that way?
"If" I accept?! Of course I'm going to accept! it's what I always wanted!
I don't know who I am! I still don't know!
I gave you that tongue and I can rip it out!
So, I'm cruisin' the rafters and... what can I say, I struck out. I thought chicks would like the fact that I can talk, you know but, I mean, the way things are going I couldn't get invited to a plague.  Someone's gotta clean that up...
Trust me, it's her!
I'm getting a chest cold..
Boy, don't you hate it when that happens?
Well, she certainly has a mind of her own.
Life is funny, isn't it. You find the right girl ... and then you lose her.
Anastasia's music box... She had this all these years...  You could have found it...
She does.
Are you impressed with our Anastasia?
Gimme a break, will yuh, gimme a break. Jesus Christ!
Can I have your autograph?
Not only is he a great agent, but he really gives good meetings.
You didn't read "Death in Venice" till I gave it to you!
Excuse... excuse me, when do I go on?
No, I'm sorry, I'm not goin'- I can't... I don't wanna go on after that comedian.
No, because they're-they're laughing, so  I-I-I'd rather not. If you don't mind, I prefer-
Then everybody's in in the conspiracy?
I-I-I-I would leave out the men's- room attendant.
Two minutes, Alvy.
Alright. All right, all right, so whatta you wanna do?
I'm-I'm-I'm gonna have a stroke.
Boy, those guys in the French Resistance were really brave, you know? Got to listen to Maurice Chevalier sing so much.
I know. Well, Alvy, it'll pass, it'll pass, it's just that I'm going through a phase, that's all.
Talk to him. You speak shellfish!  Hey, look... put it in the pot.
Annie, there's a big lobster behind the refrigerator. I can't get it out. This thing's heavy. Maybe if I put a little dish of butter sauce here with a nutcracker, it will run out the other side, you know what I mean?
Well, then, w-who was?
He was creepy.
Oh, that's right. That you really like those New York girls.
Well, bye. She laughs and backs up slowly toward the door.
Sure. W-w-w-which way yuh goin'?
Down- I'm-I'm goin' uptown.
No, no thanks. Hey, don't-
Yeah... so, listen-you drive?
Yeah, it's a great story, though, I mean, I... I... it really made my day. Hey, I think I should get outta here, you know, 'cause I think I'm imposing, you know...
Oh, I see, I see.
what I mean?
Hey, listen, listen.
Yeah, why not, because we're just gonna go home later, right?
My first... Yes, she was nice, but you know, uh, it was my fault. I was just... I was too crazy.
H'm?
Oh, yeah?
No.  You're a wreck.
Yeah?
You see, like you and I...
That little apartment is four hundred dollars a month, Alvy.
Does this sound like a good course? Uh, "Modern American Poetry"? Uh, or, uh-let's see now... maybe I should, uh, take "Introduction to the Novel."
Uh-uh-why?
Yeah-well, you wanted to keep the relationship flexible, remember? It's your phrase.
Hey, don't knock masturbation! It's sex with someone I love.
"Neat"! There's that- What are you- twelve years old? That's one o' your Chippewa Falls expressions! "He thinks I'm neat."
And I didn't have to lie down on the couch, Alvy, she had me sitting up. So I told her about-about the-the family and about my feelings toward men and about my relationship with my brother.
And then she mentioned penis envy... Did you know about that?
Yeah.
Yeah, and he's strangling me...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you. Because in the dream... I break Sinatra's glasses.
Are you okay?  What's the matter?  Are you all right? What-
I told you a thousand times you should always keep, uh, a lotta insect spray. You never know who's gonna crawl over.
You know I think that if you let me, maybe I could help you have more fun, you know? I mean, I know it's hard and... Yeah.
Okay, okay. Okay.
Here's a real present.
Check it out.
Don't you remember we-we-we discussed that thing that we were-
That's sick!
God.
Christ!
Whose "Catcher in the Rye" is this?
Hey, this one's mine, this button. This one, you rem-
Hey, you didn't read "Death in Venice" till I bought it for yuh.
You mean that...  I-I-I-I flew three thousand miles to see you.
This is my room.
What'd I do?
Oh, really, I heard that Commentary and Dissent had merged and formed Dysentery.
Jesus, last night it was some guy honking his car horn. I mean, the city can't close down. You know, what-whatta yuh gonna do, h-have 'em shut down the airport, too? No more flights so we can have sex?
Tsch, a few.
I can think of another word.
Really? It must be a tremendous hem.
Oh, sex with you is really a kafkaesque experience.
You know, it must need to have had its leading from one thought to another. You know what I'm talking about?
Like all that Juliet of the Spirits or Satyricon, I found it incredibly... indulgent. You know, he really is. He's one of the most indulgent film makers. He really is-
I never read that. That was-that was Henry James, right? Novel, uh, the sequel to Turn of the Screw? My Sexual...
Don't give me your life story  just pick up the license.
No, I'm not. We were walking off the tennis court, and you know, he was there and me and his wife, and he looked at her and then they both looked at me, and under his breath he said, "Jew."
No, no, no, Max, that's a very convenient out. Every time some group disagrees with you it's because of anti-Semitism.
Max, if we lived in California, we could play outdoors every day, in the sun.
Yeah, the neighborhood's gonna be great.
Right. I was a great athlete. Tell her, Max, I was the best, I was all schoolyard.
There's no economic crime, you know, but there's-there's ritual, religious- cult murders, you know, there's wheat- germ killers out here.
We do the show live in front of an audience.
Well, sit down.
Twins, Max. Sixteen-year-olds. Can you imagine the mathematical possibilities?
You fired the cleaning woman?
Now, don't let it be so long, now.
Oh, he's adorable, Annie.
Well, hi!
Well, hey, that's, that's nice. Uh. Oh, listen, this is, uh, Alvy Singer. Do you know Alvy? Uh... and... uh... Tony Lacey.
We just need about six weeks, in about six weeks we could cut a whole album.
It could be freezing, it could be raining.
Tessie, they say you were the sister with personality.
Uh, how did this personality come about?
There were many men interested in you?
So who won?
Had a little help?
Can we... one at a time?  Hold it down, and one at a time.  You're last, Cal.
The movie.
Any thoughts on casting yet?
You've got a lot of fucking gall.  Thirty nine.
What a fucking day!  We only just got a sitter.  I don't know her from fucking Adam.  She could be a serial killer.  I'm going to have to call every ten minutes. You have to let me give out the number.
I'm fine.  I'm fine.  Well, I'm a little stressed.  And I've been taking pills to get my weight down since the baby.
I'd love a Xanex.  Sally, please don't tell Sophia that I'm not breast feeding.
So where is young Jonah?
You should have brought him.
Is he not going?  I booked a flight.
It's not a contest.
Take good care of it.
Directing suits you.
And?
There's a test, you know.
Oh yeah...
I call that a perfect day.
What you earn has to double in order to cover expenses in London, it's an outrageously expensive city.
Scout's honor.
You're out of your mind.
I love you.  Most beautiful woman in the world.
What?
What?
Okay.  I'm sorry, look, I meant to tell you.  It was the only chance I had to meet her.
I can't imagine anyone else playing Genna.
Two minutes.
Dolphins.  Great.
Can't have gone far?  He's like a greyhound.  He could be miles away.
Otis!!!!
Otis!  Come!  Good boy!  Come!
I don't look my age, Joe.
Not really.  I mean your books have always been pop, but this is the shallowest of the bunch.  That's what all our friends think, anyway.
Who?  Who?  Who thinks that?
Cal, too?
Don't.
I told you when we met I never wanted children.  I don't want kids in my life. We talked about it.  You weren't listening.
Don't make allowances.  I'll never be ready.  Some people just shouldn't have children.  I'd be a terrible fucking mother, Joe.  I did want it for us.  But I couldn't do it.  I don't really think I can do it.
Yes.
No.
I know.  It's for the baby's crib.
Yes I did.
Joking.
You lose this?
You got your DP?
Oh, yes.  You know Ryan's been sober eight years.  And it's difficult if I... you know.  It's better if I don't.
I'm a little nervous, so...
Well, yes.  Yes, in fact.  A little on the outside, yes.  And there's been all this friction.
And Ryan works at home.
Would you sign it for me.  I'm sure this is inappropriate.
Lemon or raspberry?
It's really not the same thing.  He was really nicer when he drank.
Eight years, though.  That's quite an accomplishment.
I know you changed it to a bookstore. And the color of my hair.  But the moment was exactly the same.  The same, you know, dynamic.  And almost verbatim, wasn't it?
How do you do, Skye?
I think there are sixteen there.
I didn't say a word.
Jesus Christ.
I think you should then.  You should look in on Sheila.
Are you making an ass of yourself?
What?
Hi.  Monica and Ryan?
That was my clue.
How about someone who really really liked Shostakovich?
No, I'm just testing to see how deeply perverted and impulsive you are.
Panes is here!
They're not just our business managers, Panes.
I don't want it to be just one of our parties.
Like the last time.
Well, something's wrong.
Panes?
You're keeping a record, are you?
Oh my God, sorry.  I'm interrupting.
You don't need to do that.
Nevermind.
Well, I don't trust her.  I never have.
What do you mean, thank God?
Oh Soph, Joe loves kids.  Joe wants kids. Joe thinks he needs kids.
Break's over.
Wait a minute, that's no soldier -- that's Z!
Someone who follows his heart!
So, um...how was your day?  What did you do?
The palace, hunh?  I bet those royals really live it up.  Of course they're all a little, you know, from inbreeding --
You're right!
He was a worker.  I danced with him at a <u>worker's bar</u> just the other day. I'm not shocking you, am I?
Gee, uh, could you say it a little louder, I think there are some ants in the next colony who didn't hear you.
What <u>was</u> that thing?
Excuse me, I --  Pardon me --  And they call them social insects.
I've been kidnapped by the village idiot.
<u>Insectopia</u>?  You stupid worker, that's just a fairy tale!
This lake is huge!  And so close to the colony!  Think of the vacation potential!
Out here I'm just what?
Look.  How many other Princesses are there?
Face it, Z, we're lost!  We must have walked halfway across the world by now!  How did I get into this mess...
Z...if we don't make it...I just want you to know....
Come on, Z.
Hang in there, buddy!  You can make it!  Just -- take deep breaths, I'll try and find your body -- it's gotta be around here somewhere!
Notice the big one, holding hands with the female?
What do we have on this "Insectopia"?
So tell me.  Where's Z?
May I cut in?
Conversation...yes...well...  Wasn't she briefed?
...I should?
Ask me why we're so successful.
Well I'm gonna <u>start</u> doing things for you...
Wear this.
I didn't really do anything -- honest -- I mean, you take a girl out a couple of times a week -- just for laughs -- and right away she thinks you're serious -- marriage-wise.
Beatnik! Go to my kitchen -- third drawer, under the good silver, there is napkins.
All right -- I'll tell him.  Hey, Baxter -- that was Personnel. Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
Oh, I never catch colds.
You should have stayed in bed this morning.
Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.  You know, you're the only one around here who ever takes his hat off in the elevator.
All right? That's wonderful! It's the Majestic -- 44th Street.
I forgive you.
You couldn't help yourself. I mean, when you're having a drink with one man, you can't just suddenly walk out on him because you have another date with another man. You did the only decent thing.
One more?
You all right? What's the matter?
Well, as long as you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with me -- how about the three of us going out this evening -- you and me and the bowler -- stroll down Fifth Avenue -- sort of break it in --
Oh, you don't have to worry about that. I have quite a bit of influence in Personnel. You know Mr. Sheldrake?
What is it?
Your phone.
Don't you remember? We were at the office party together --
I didn't know -- I had no idea this was your apartment --
Miss Kubelik, I'm stronger than you are --
Wait a minute -- let's talk this over first.  Just what are you going to tell her?
I didn't mean it that way -- I was just talking to him on the phone -- he's very concerned about you.
She doesn't seem to like you very much.
I am. Let me get the cards.
I don't want it.
I just have this talent for falling in love with the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time. BUD  How many guys were there?
Too slow?
What for?
I don't like myself very much anyway.
-- Mr. Sheldrake.
Are you all right?
Thank you.
Yes, you are,  When I was straightening up the couch, you know what I found? Six hairpins, a lipstick, a pair of false eyelashes, and a swizzle stick from the Stork Club.
Anyway, I parked the car and loaded the gun -- well, you read in the papers all the time that people shoot themselves, but believe me, it's not that easy -- I mean, how do you do it? -- here, or here, or here --  -- you know where I finally shot myself?
Yeah. Took me a year before I could bend my knee -- but I got over the girl in three weeks. She still lives in Cincinnati, has four kids, gained twenty pounds -- she sends me a fruit cake every Christmas.
Are we dressing for dinner?
Say, you're pretty good with that racquet.
Shall I light the candles?
You know what we're going to do after dinner?
We're going to finish that gin game.
Yes.  You walking to the subway?
Are you sure? How's your knee?
I love you, Miss Kubelik.
Baxter?
Mr. Vanderhof, in Public Relations, and Mr. Eichelberger, in Mortgage and Loan -- they'd both like to have you transferred to their departments.
Would you mind repeating the question?
Oh.
How do you work it with the key?
How would you like to go tonight?
Oh -- terribly sorry. It's that cold --
Now remember, Baxter -- this is going to be our little secret.
You know how people talk.
Oh, yes. Very attractive. Is she -- the lucky one?
No, thank you, Mr. Sheldrake. As a matter of fact, I've got some money for you -- a hundred dollars --
Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news for you --
Sir?
It's about Miss Kubelik -- she's all right again -- so she went back home.
Don't mind what?
No key!
Say, Baxter -- you gave me the wrong key.
But this is the key to the executive washroom.
Now hold on, Baxter --
Mr. Kirkeby, I don't like to complain -- but you were supposed to be out of here by eight.
I don't mind in the summer -- but on a rainy night -- and I haven't had any dinner yet --
That Kubelik -- boy!  Would I like to get her on a slow elevator to China.
Baxter, we're a little disappointed in you -- gratitude-wise.
Hiya, Buddy-boy.  I'm in this bar on Sixty-first Street -- and I got to thinking about you -- and I figured I'd give you a little buzz.
Dobisch -- Joe Dobisch, in Administration.
That's okay, Buddy-boy.  Now like I was saying, I'm in this joint on Sixty-first -- and I think I got lucky --  -- she's a skater with the Ice Show --  -- and I thought maybe I could bring her up for a quiet drink.
Cancel? But it's her birthday -- I already ordered the cake --
Good evening, Baxter.
Say, Baxter -- the way you're belting that stuff, you must have a pair of cast-iron kidneys.
Sometimes,  there's a twi-night double-header.  A nebbish like you!
You know, Baxter -- I'm doing some research at the Columbia Medical Center -- and I wonder if you could do us a favor?
There's a girl in my place -- she took some sleeping pills -- you better come quick -- I can't wake her up.
She going to be all right, Doc?
Want to tell me what happened?
So you went right out and picked yourself up another dame.
Any of that coffee left?
What's this -- you packing?
Sorry to lose you, Baxter.
No, thanks -- I don't feel like it. Look, Doc -- in case I don't see you again -- how much do I owe you for taking care of that girl?
You know me with girls. Easy come, easy go. Goodbye, Doc.
That so.
Gee. Sort of gives you goose-bumps just to think about it.
Not so rough, honey.
Good night?
What's the matter? Did I do something wrong?
I see.  What do you think, Al? Can we help the man?
Do you know where you are, Fran?
I missed you, Fran.
I don't believe you.
You're not giving me a chance, Fran. I asked you to meet me because -- I have something to tell you. FRAN Go ahead -- tell me.
No. I have a date at eight-thirty.
Fran -- remember that last weekend we had?
That's enough, Fran.
What do you think?
Oh. Our friend from the Chinese restaurant. Thanks, Fran. We better keep it here.
Are you there, Fran?
I know it's a drag -- but you can't find a hotel room in town -- not on New Year's Eve.
Please, Sylvia!  It's a quarter to nine!
Yes? Oh, hello -- sure I got home all right -- you owe me forty-five cents.
Me? SHELDRAKE Thank you for giving that little pep talk to Miss Kubelik at the office party.
Look -- we got in a little trouble -- they rudely took our helicopter for MedEvac work on this -- uh Operation Brute Force -- They just brought it back this morning.
Look -- you know who that is, Captain -- you know what she's saying -- you'll never see stuff that good outside of a magazine for the rest of your life.
Take your pick -- they all like you -- I can tell --
What !
You make some of your closest friends in the army -- war has a way of bringing men together.
Two whole drums --
I don't know what you're talking about -- Get fucked --
Who the hell are you?
What unit were you with ?
Rangers, eh?
I didn't know we had units up there in North Vietnam.
A year ? Waiter another beer.
Why they call you that?
How?
I've arranged with those people we saw at Hau Fat to give us some 50 caliber in trade for a couple a drums of fuel --
And the grass?
Charlie?
Who's he?
Flood.
Yeah -- fishing village -- helicopters over there. Hueys, lots of 'em.
Yeah, Chef -- go ahead -- take Lance with you --
What're you trying to say, Captain --
Get in there !
They're not Cong.
Listen.
I never heard about that.
Jesus -- that guy's too damn much.
You want me to clean it up -- simple and quiet.
What -- happened here.
You know much about about Special Forces; Green Berets, Captain ?
I thought he was a lame.
This is years ago, before he joined Special Forces, I guess. We had an argument.
American weapons?
We don't want to bother you any, we --
But we civilized it. A place belongs to those who bring light to it, don't you agree.
When I was a boy, my father would take me there, to hunt. There are a few savages, but no man can live there, no white man.
Two of my men deserted last night. It happens from time to time. I assume my daughter told you of our conditions.
You smell that.  You smell that?
How big it is?
Eagle Thrust Four -- Big Duke Six. Join me in sparaying some trees.
Seems to me he got himself fragged. i heard some grunt rolled a grenade in his tent. Maybe a rumor. Helluva man -- remarkable officer. Walter Kurtz woulda been a General some day. General of the Army. Shit, Head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Did you knew Kurtz?
I mean it's hairy -- they got some pretty heavy ordnance, boy -- I've lost a few recon ships in there now and again.
And I don't intend to get some of them chewed up just to get your tub put in the mouth of the goddman Nung River. You say you don't know Kurtz?
Fucking savages.
Yeah, I can see that. He's fuckin nuts --
You've gone crazy.
No -- I don't want to sleep. I want to think. Water. Give me water.
How's yours?
Pain is easy to handle -- but nobility.. the nobility of a man is judged by how much Truth he can handle.
Gimme water.
How did we get here?
Going back  - to the jungle to die.
Were you with him, when...
Captain -- that was all true about the rats and chocolate and stuff?
You think?
I'd just clear out as soon as I could if I were you, sir. They're gonna start working on the bridge with torches again. Charlie will start throwing it in hard --
This boat's a mess.
Simple. They don't want him to go.
But lemme tell you, he is the most dangerous thing in every way that I've come on so far. He wanted to shoot me. The first thing he said is, 'I'm going to shoot you because you are a deserter.' I said I didn't desert from your army, I deserted from my army. He said, 'I'm going to shoot you just the same.'
Well who the hell verifies that ?
What show ?

Watch it with Meyerling.  Man's as mean and corrupt as they get. Cut his mother's throat if it'd get him a couple votes.
My dad was a Navy doctor.
What about you -- why come back? Classy girl like you seems more suited to the finer things.
Have you talked to Eric?
-- Get this straight: I'm the District Supervisor.  Whatever you do reflects on me.  It wasn't my idea to bring you people up here, but I'm stuck with you. You are absolutely not to involve yourself in any local disputes. Whichever side you take, you alienate the other.  Mr. Corbett is quite well-known in this region.  People admire him --
Really.  I thought maybe that was his snowmobile outside.  By the way -- your truck also 'on the fritz?'
What are you doing?
Was there any trouble?
Look, why get into this again. As long as it's working, let's leave it alone.  It's been nice so far.  We're together --
Let's go.
You're hurt.
When you ran off, I thought you'd keep going 'til you were back home in Washington.
Go ahead.  Take the jeep.  I'll come to Cache with Bob when he gets here.
Kenai at the general store asked me to bring these.  Didn't expect we'd already met.
Desmond.
Sounds like professional jealousy.
Next time you want to kill yourself, don't include me.
Let's camp.  There's grayling under this ice. I'll snare some for dinner.
Sure love to know where you fit in up here.
There's a cabin, maybe twenty miles south of here.
Told you I'm fine!
I'm hungry.  Go kill me some dinner.
Nome?  I figure you'd be a whaler, coming from there.
Killing wildlife not good enough anymore, so you go on to bigger and better things.
Talk to that good-looking girl of yours?
Emergency transmitter?  What happened to signal mirrors or two-tone smoke fires?
Snow's to their advantage, kid. You can't see them, but soon as that plane comes, they'll sure as hell know where we're going. Wise up.  Take me to the Yukon. I'll give you that money and guarantee you'll walk away.
How come you didn't let him shoot me?
All this for laying traps on private land?
You better get some sleep.
Goddammit, I don't need this aggravation.  I'll shoot you, Ben.  Bank on it.
-- Here's a hundred dollars.  And if you or anyone else will back me up on this --
Jiminy Christmas.  What do you want from me?
Neff, you know better than this...
Alleged killer.
You can't see past your lousy little assignment, sniffing around the pipeline.  The few voters there are in this district look up to Corbett, and I'm not about to alienate them.
Nobody wants any more killings; we all agree to that, correct?  That's good.  Now, Eric, you're gonna hand your prisoner over to us.
Bet you're right.  But I didn't come by to wangle a meal --
Why the smirk?
He saw you and Corbett come in...
Dead.  Trappers killed him.
Go easy.
Thought that door was open last night...
You hear me?  Ben?
Meaning he'll need a plane.
It's Sam Wilder!
There's what they're waiting on!
I didn't know you had a secret admire.
There is a seriously goofy man behind this. You are not allowed to block out that fact.
It lets a crazy man into our lives.
How was it talking to him?
Stop it!! Why can't I have a normal boyfriend??? Why? Get out of here. Just a regular boyfriend who doesn't go nuts on me...
Hi...  Did you know there are doctors who come to your house?
My wife is Melvin Udall's publisher.  She says I have to take great care of this guy because you're urgently needed back at work. What work do you do?
Have they done skin testing for allergies?
Me. My home number is on this card.
I know. He's just the best.
What's with the plastic picnic ware? Why not try ours...  afraid it isn't clean?
Sorry.
Okay, pal...  I accept the compliment, but go easy -- my knees start a-knocking when you turn on the charm full blast.
I am trying to keep emotions out of this. Even though this is an important issue to me and I have strong feelings about the subject.
I'm not kidding.
What's this?
Hello?
Hi.
I -- uh, I... Well, there is no place cards or anything.
... my father didn't leave his room for 11 years -- he hit my hand with a yardstick if I made a mistake on the piano.
My son was outside playing soccer. I never saw him playing ball. Come on, you guys -- take me out for a good time... Take me out dancing.
Stop asking everyone.
No... I'm not wearing that -- and just in case you were going to ask I'm not going to let you inject me with plaque either.
That's maybe the best compliment of my life.
Well, ah... that's a personal question.
I'll never forget you said it.
I don't.
Okay to say something now?
I should've danced with you.
What do you want?
I wasn't asleep!!
Boyfriend?
Was this supposed to be your room?
Can you not be violent?
One night with me!
I love you...  Let him take you home.
What the heck do you mean?
So, what's new anyway? How's Verdell?
Police! Police! Fucking crooked police...  doughnut-munching morons help me!  Assault and battery and you're black.
Hey, where are you going? You can't do this.  I can't take a dog.  Nobody's ever been in here before.
How's Verdell doing?
No. He wants him back. He'll be by tomorrow.
I did. And his stomach is out of whack. So they need him for a couple of days.
Yes. And tomorrow? I have a high maintenance selling painter coming through... So I'm out. Can you take him?
How you doing, great one?
No. Please, don't force him.
Sorry. What are those cards?
The medical bill are 61 thousand now. I've spoken to your parents and they didn't hang up or anything -- they just said they would feel strange calling you.
Mr. Udall... excuse me. Hey there!  Have you seen Verdell?
Which color was that?
Yeeeess!!!
I found Verdell, Mr. Udall.
Go away.
Well, I always painted. Always. And my mother always encouraged it. She was sort of fabulous about it actually... and she used to... I was too young to think there was anything at all wrong with it... and she was very natural. She used to pose nude for me... and I thought or assumed my father was aware of it.
Not it at all, really.
You going to come talk to me or not?
Okay... you tell me why --  "You're dying here."
Picking on me won't help.
Exactly what is your previous experience?
Why are you doing this?
What?
Yeah.
Robert Bain, driving me!  Jesus fucking Christ!
So what happens now?
What are you doing?
No, no.  Wait.  You don't want me to jump.  You're going to jump.  I'm stuck back here until it's too late. Wham -- over!
What does that fucking mean?
You understand what's going on?  It makes sense, right?
You don't know a fucking thing about me.  You don't have the slightest fucking clue.
I'll tell you this.  After Cleveland, I thought I was lucky to be alive.  But now, here, I just realized that you were the lucky one.
How in the fuck do you know that?
Deadline?
Is this how it went, Nick?
What?
Um, five.
You're one of them, aren't you?  A fucking pro.
And you want to use me to get him?
You don't know that -- you're trying to scare me.
Had?
It looks like white's game.
He was... taken.
No.  I graduated from George Washington University.  Then I entered the Agency training program.
No, they didn't.
Because you are a women.
It was... mechanical.  Very precise. It was exactly like the training drill except for the adrenaline.
They become complicated... messy.
It.  Tell it.  For all I know it could be a machine.
That's where he'll be.
Do you think about the game?
Not even a stalemate?
What will you do if this works, if we get the money?
Do you think he's here?
I know what you are thinking.  I'm not going to disappear, okay?  I'm not going anywhere, just down there, to that beautiful beach.  I got to get out of this room, just for a little while.
You should knock.
Not that I would know, but you look like you're really good at it.
The sun will be low, almost dark, the air cool and the bank will almost be closed.  5:45.  5:50.  He will put the rifle down, he will get up and he will walk across the plaza to the bank.
He can't.  The bank has an expensive security system; metal detectors and X-ray machines.
That's right.
Five million apiece.  You get on your plane, I get on mine.
What?
What is it?  I don't like this at all.  What is going on here?
What did he say?
Do you have ulcers?
They're worth less points.
Nobody ever sees me.
She is married, but not to him. Another man, much older.  She has four kids.  The young guy works for her.  And I think she likes kinky sex.
No?
Can I ask you something?
It happened to you before?
Maybe you should see a psychiatrist.
I waited another four minutes.
Wait until he is on the stairs.
I'll make my usual arrangements and expect my usual bonus.
I prefer it like this.
That's okay, hon, I always expect the unexpected.
Is that all you want?
How much farther?
Hey, do you mind if I talk a little?  I feel like, I don't know, talking I guess.
Funny, I've never been a talker. My wife was always getting on me about that.  'Say what you feel, tell me what's bothering you, you ve got to talk to me.'  I never would though.  Not really.
Oh yeah?  I guess we still need to see that price tag.  Like art, right?  You hang some painting that looks like baby-puke in your living room only if it costs a bundle.
One hundred thousand?  That's it? Jesus... Is that a lot?
I have been thinking about this for a long while.  I knew this day was coming.  I knew someday someone would make the call on me. I never thought about anyone that I had whacked.  What do you call it anyway?
How would you like the funds?
This will take some time.
What are you having?
But we are underground?
You guys having a go a me or what?
Sorry Katka, but I'm with Doug on this.
Anything in it?
Just because they've got a choice of four McDonalds, doesn't mean they can afford a cheeseburger.
Fifteen crowns.
You were right Jahn, it's a great space..... Hey, Chris. Do you want to come and look?
That stinks!
No, he was talking about girls, I think.
I'm making history Chris, nothings going to stop me. There could be a knighthood for us in this, once President Havel hears.
No.....But I think Honza at the office has. You keep shifting this crap and I'll take care of the locks, shouldn't take long. Take a break for lunch and I'll catch you up later.
Tell them we're working for the University.
Yep, except a name for this place.
No, why?
I've been saying that since we met.
I'll rig up something don't worry - Do you think I could bash through with that little hammer?
Need any disks?
Yeah, her name's Kavlova, why?
Nope.
We're going to need it all.
So why didn't we?
Afternoon!
No, not if you've got better things to do.
I see, you've got your hands too far up your collective arse to pull it out long enough except to drink my bloody wine.
And a tram hit you?
Chris, can you do me a favour?
It's me you want, I'm responsible for all this.
They're good guys..... Have you seen Holly?
Yeah. I tell you, they're one big happy family over there.
Do you want me to see what's on them?
Doug, I can't just leave you!
You mean, Josh's father had nothing to do with it?
Yeah, pretty well.
I don't know what it is with you bloody hooligans. Not content with causing trouble back home, YOU idiots have to go off and wreak havoc throughout the whole of Europe. And when finally, the police do catch up with you, you expect us to wave a magic wand and get you out, well not this time, I'm sorry.
Let's walk over the bridge, we haven't done that for a while.
Beer please! Do you want another drink?
I could have my choice of many boyfriends and go to movies and discos but I waste my time waiting for you and then going to stupid pubs.
I don't understand, it's your home?
Forget about me Kat.
Yeah, for sure.
No, I am an actor not a labourer, I am just warning you, that's all.
Sure, they are students.
There's three thousand crowns, it's all I got.
Yeah, it's a simple piece. If they get the floor done in time, me and the others will rehearse tomorrow afternoon, but it's not critical.
About forty minutes.
Okay?
It is okay........We will paint the wood black, yes?
Yes, of course...maybe one hour.
You mean it's started?
I'll put one on the notice-board too.
Alright, go help Chris shovel up the last of the crap.
Why are you doing all this, what for?
Is it dry?
What would you like, beer?
I'd better get you to a hospital.
Run into Josh?
Better than you.
Where did you steal the car?
This is your doing?
You will wish you hadn't.
Really!
I'm not sure it's possible.
Would you like your things now?
Central station, locker number 139 - combination JFK.
Hey Doug, where you been?
Nothing. I've got to put up some kitchen shelves that's all. You've got one haven't you?
When the hell did you write that?
All I'm saying Honey is run the thing past me for Christ's sake before you get up and broadcast the crap.
Yeah, so I hear. Don't you think you should go get changed?
Come on Holly!
Honey what a pleasant surprise, sorry to keep you waiting.
Will you come home and forget all about him?
Why are there still such headlines?
You know everyone can be controlled Pavel. Where are you storing the personnel files?
The University cannot do this. Is the room safe?
That's one girl who can't take a hint.
What if they expel you?
'Bout what?
To see your father?
You do. You're handsome and charming.
Have I told you how proud I am of you -- ?
I'm sorry. I didn't know.
Hypotheticals --
The address?!
Landon!
Say nothing. Nothing 'bout her.
You.
You mean care what you say? I'm worrying about other things.
Can't you have a normal conversation?
Fire is like a living thing. Wild. Unpredictable.
I'm an enemy?
You got some kind of list?
Like you'd know.
I'll get something for us to drink --
So it's like you want to be secret friends.
He okay?
Maybe you inspire me.
You don't either. Take a look at yourself. Maybe you're scared that someone might actually like you --
It's places like this that make me certain there's a God.
Assholes. This happen to you?
Come on.
What'd you tell your father?
What's the best thing I can see tonight?
Help me live until I die?
Nope.
You know how to waltz??
It's gone now.
I'm asking how much.
When Mom died you told me God wanted her more, loved her more --
I'm sorry she never got her miracle.
Like you'd make it to June. Even cutting half your classes, you have a B- average.
Now I can do what I want.
Finding the real world to your liking, Mr. Carter?
It's mine to give. I didn't steal it.
This is 1952....?
What's N.R.C.?
Learn anything?
It's polyester.
Well, I was on my way to school, and I just wanted to stop by and see if you were feeling okay.  You seemed like you were in pretty bad shape the other night.
What time does school start around here?
George! He's supposed to ask you to the dance!
Well, Eileen...jeez, that's hard for me to say. Have you ever been in a situation where -- well -- you know you have to act a certain way, but when you get there, you don't know if you can go through with it?
Uh, hi, Eileen.
Fine..
Oh yeah.
What do I say?
Huh?
'Bike fine point?'
I don't want to hit you in the stomach!
You're not picking a fight, you're coming to her rescue. Maybe we'd better go over the plan again. Where are you gonna be at 8:55?
Yeah, explode it up your ass!
March 11th.
What, am I radioactive or something?
Been any place unusual in the past twelve hours?
What?!
But Professor --
No, Marty. Shemp's molecular structure is completely intact!
A time machine! Because of that Coke?!
Of course. Shemp is unaware that anything even happened, other than his stool suddenly falling over. We had to wait two minutes to catch up to him, but for Shemp the trip was instantaneous.
Jeez -- this is where you used to live, huh? You must have been rich!
Pardon me?
4200 rads...  That certainly can't be generated under controlled conditions in this day and age.
You answered the door!
Let me put it on a level you can understand. You don't belong here. You don't know anything about this world. You don't know the customs, you don't know how to talk, how to act -- you don't even look like you belong here. And if you walked out on the street, you wouldn't get 100 yards without being arrested. Then there would be questions, and where would we come up with the answers?
I am serious. If we could get you, the time machine, and the power converter in the vicinity of an atomic blast, we could send you back to the future.
Say, where did this guitar come from?
I don't recall ever seeing it before.
Look, it's not a big deal! I can fix it! All I gotta do is get 'em together and make sure my old man asks her out!
Apparently, what has happened is that the maternal instinct has transcended the gap of time and this has caused an alteration in your mother's emotional behavior.
It was sure nice of Uncle Sam to put those yardage markers up for us.
Marty,  I know I've repeatedly asked you not to tell me anything about the future, but....well, those loud bangs on the tape recorder....are they....
You see, I never rebuilt the time machine after it was destroyed in 1952. I decided that experimenting with time and possibly changing history was too risky. Anyway, experiments in time travel were banned in all 87 states after the governor of Cuba caught Dr. Felstien fooling around in the Bermuda Triangle -- that was back in '64.
What happened to Dick Wilson?
Gone?... Where?
What you been doing?
I'll catch up with you.
That your spider in there? In that bottle?
You lost that one?
Kit... Kit, I've got a question for you.
Well, I've got to read them first. Suppose I could get a Coke while I do?
Well, Kit...
You know, before I met her, nobody could ask me how I was doing with my girl. Matter of fact, I didn't really have one.
Hi, I'm Kit. I'm not keeping you from anything important, am I?
Listen, Holly, you want to take a walk with me?
Doing what?
Well, that I shouldn't be seen with anybody that collects garbage.
Hi.
Anybody ever call you "Red"?
Can I come around and see you tomorrow?
Is that all there is to it?
I can look and see.
Look at all this junk.
Whatcha looking in there for? We can't afford any of that.
Think I got 'em?
You tired?
Yes.
You smoke Pall Mall?
Course it's too bad about your dad.
What's that?
This your place?
Good deal... Oh, uh, we're on the run and we'd like to hang out here for a while. Couple of hours, maybe. How'd that be?
Morning... Say, you got any gas?
You tossed my hat out the window.
Antidote to what?  Whose disguises?
Go back to the bus and reroute the call.
You're a welcome sight...
Apache?
It wouldn't tell us the whole story until you got here.  It wasn't to talk to the head honcho.
Dead.  Damnit!
What is this thing?  A fighter?
Pull up!  We did it!  Holy shit, we did it!  Pull up!
And there's a two-hundred-dollar deductible we have to eat on that crack in her windshield.
...but he wasn't the real Doctor Lizardo...just this arachtoid creep that stole the good doc's body the year before in the Eighth Dimension when Prof. Hikita's lab exploded...
Somebody get her a mike? Can we manage that?  And a spotlight.  What's your name?
Go away.  Let me rot?
You.  Like the papers all say.
Was she pretty?
A thermonuclear holocaust, sir.  These creatures from Planet 10 are ready to exploit Soviet-American tensions and get us to blow each other off the face of the earth, sir, if necessary.
What? A black ship?  Where?  A black thermopod's been shot down ten miles back.
Where was it, John O'Connor? How far back?
Jammed--? By who? Whom by?
How long you been riding with Buckaroo, Reno?
What's his problem?
Pictures don't lie.
Doctor Lizardo. Wasn't he on TV once?
Any sign of Buckaroo?
Is, uh... Is he okay?
I'll be fine... Are you a writer, Mr Fink?
Let him go.
...Oh Barton, I feel so... sorry for him!
Pick it up... Pick it up. Pick it-
Audrey, listen, I need help. I know it's late and I shouldn't be calling you like this  believe me I wouldn't have if I could see any other alternative, but I  I'm sorry - listen, how are you  I'm sorry. You doing okay?
Well, Bill was ALWAYS the author, so to speak-
Barton, honestly, only the last couple-
If I close m'eyes I can almost smell the live oak.
...This'll sometimes help.
M'honey pretends to be impatient with me, Barton, but she'll put up with anything.
I'm a writer. Ted Okum said you're producing this Wallace Beery picture I'm working on.
Don't worry about it. It's just a B picture. I bring it in on budget, they'll book it without even screening it. Life is too short.
Wuddya got for me  what the hell happened to your face?
Understand shit! I though you were gonna consult another writer on this!
I don't understand-
I didn't say anything-
I thought you were going to join us. Jesus, Garland, you left me alone with those people.
What do you do far a living?
...Barton, is everything okay?
Neighbor, I'd feel better about the damned inconvenience if you'd let me buy you a drink.
What kind of work do you do, Barton, if you don't mind my asking?
That's okay, Charlie. I'm a playwright. My shows've only played New York. Last one got a hell of a write-up in the Herald. I guess that's why they wanted me here.
Caught me trying to be fancy! Yeah, that's it, Bart.
Well ain't that a kick in the head!
Oh, yeah. An ear infection, chronic thing.  Goes away for a while, but it always comes back. Gotta put cotton in it to staunch the flow of pus. Don't worry, it's not contagious.
Nope, never watched any. I'm not that interested in the act itself 
...Did I say rude? People can be goddamn cruel. Especially some of their housewives. Okay, so I've got a weight problem. That's my cross to bear. I dunno...
How did you know about that?
...I guess it seems pathetic to a guy like you.
Why don't we go to your room-
Stop with the police! Wake up, friend! This does not look good! They hang people for this!
Jesus, Charlie, I...
You'll be back?
...Yes, thank you.
I  Mr. Lipnik 
Mr. Lipnik, I 
Fink.
...I was commissioned yesterday in the Army Reserve. Henry Morgenthau arranged it. He's a dear friend.
...Those your only bags?
L.A.P.D.
Got a couple questions to ask ya.
Hollywood precinct finds another stiff yesterday. Not too far from here. This one's better looking than the doc.
Second one of your friends to end up dead.
Why's it so goddamn hot out here?
...Thanks Lou. Join us. Join us. Talking about the Wallace Beery picture.
We got a treatment on it yet?
Get down on your knees, you sonofabitch!  Get down on your knees and kiss this man's feet!
All night?
Yeah, I was drinking.
Come on -- I'm going to storm into his office in front of everybody in the afternoon and then that night I'm going to kill him?  I'd have to be really dumb to do that.
Hey, that's Dr. Gardner, isn't it?
How are you, Nick?
How about the booze?
Yes.
You okay?
Who?
You did it for me.
What is your problem?  I'm trying to help you.  Why won't you let me help you?
I thought you hardly know her.
You should do something about this lock.
Put your fucking hands up!  Don't move.
Don't!  I know about your husband.  You still like girls, Beth?
I told you -- I quit.
I told them you wouldn't want to hide.
Because you didn't love him --
Even though you were fucking him.
I don't know anything that isn't police business.
Am I... disturbing you?
You tell me.
It was an accident.  They got in the line of fire.
Tell me about Professor Goldstein.
Yes.  She's helped me understand homicidal impulse.
Why not?
What did you pay Nilsen?
Bitch mostly, but he meant it affectionately.  You don't have any coke, do you?  I love coke and Jack Daniel's.
Say -- "What do you want from me, Catherine?"
When did you write it?
Yes.
Did you think it was so special?
You won't believe me.
Do you believe me?
Can I talk to you a minute?
You like to hang out with murderers or what?  Did you know Roxy --
I just thought I'd surprise you.  What's the matter?
You didn't not see me long enough to miss me.
Why not?
Did you ever engage in sado- masochistic activity with him?
He was walking home from work. They only lived a coupla blocks from the clinic.  Somebody drove by and shot him.
What kind of talk?
Ain't that cute?  They got his and her Pig-assos, son.
I don't know.
You feeling better?
Come on, I'll drive you in this thing.
Catherine says you don't like her.
I'm not sure anymore she did it.
When was the last time you saw John Boz?
Are you kidding me?
What is all this "Nick" stuff -- Nick would you like a cigarette. Nick can you give me a ride.
She knew she could beat it.  That's why she asked to take it.
Come on, Phil.  You're not gonna let this slide.  What about her parents?  What about what else she's published?  At least we should get the stuff to see if we find anything else that's an amazing real-life coincidence.
Gus -- go over to Berkeley. Harrigan -- find out what else she's published.  Andrews -- get the files on her parents' accident. Carbon Beth on everything.  I want some psychological input on this Andrews and Harrigan go; Nick is left there with Gus.
I'll ask you once, Nick -- for the record did you kill him?
You're driving around North Beach for no particular reason and this car won't get out of the way --
We know you're not stupid, Ms. Tramell.
We're sorry to disturb you, we'd like to ask you some --
How old was she when this happened?
Yes I did.
No Lisa Anderson, detective.
Hey  it's the big A.M..
What do you think?
It's always how you would do it. This is my version.
Why, so you could humiliate me?
Of what?
New York.
I wish they'd quit writing this shit about me.
That was my favorite part!
Bruno called. In Europe, people are saying you're gonna die from drugs. They think they can cash in on your death.
Who is it?
How much for these five?
No.
I'd love to see some more of your work... Where's your studio?
Tom and Cynthia Kruger.
... Can you... decipher this for us?
A primate?
Not what?
I see..  And... How do you respond to being called  hmmm...   yes, "the pickaninny of the art world."
Would you like to see the wine list?
Yeah.
 In this corner?
You want me to put it here?
You got a date already?
Whatever. Famous. To where you can do your stuff all day without thinking about anything else.
What're you doing? You're doing something.
You gonna carry that around all night?
Good.
That's not how I meant it.  For all you know, you might just be a flash in the pan! You can never tell.
You do! You definitely do.
Basquiat, those are my best clothes!!! What are you doing?
... I'll buy you some new ones.
Do you know what he's saying?
It's not Sunday? I missed you. You shouldn't leave me alone.
Which island of Hawaii do you want our house to be on? Maui? Kaui? Molokai?
What's that?
Would you check out my studio some time?
Some of them.
That's a beautiful name. French?
What? Life's beautiful. Depression isn't permanent. Don't you believe that?  What is it  did your girlfriend leave you?
You see? You have someone to live for.
What is it you want? Respect? I have respect for you, just for making this call. One philosopher said "Sadness is a sin against the richness of the world." Think about it. Feel it.
You're news. I want the scoop. I write it down. When I speak, no one believes me. But when I write it down, people know it's true.  There's never been a black painter in art history that's been considered really important, you know?
That one's for you.
You don't have any!!!
You nuts? Let him order? You on his side? You're not such a good waitress. You get out, too.
It's cold.
Selina ... more facets than Vicki, huh?  Funny, but sort of mysterious...
You're not the Mayor.
I think you're jealous that I'm a genuine freak, and you have to wear a mask!
We've met.
Well that's a ... long story ...
I'm listed.
... and me.  No, that's be me and me.  Is that what I said?
There's a big, comfy California King over in Bedding.  What say we ...
... What do we do?
Hmm.  Primitive ventilation.
"Oswald" is linked to the Red Triangle Gang.  I can't prove it but we both know it's true.
What happened?
I am the light of this city.  <u>And</u> I am its mean, twisted soul.  Does it really matter who's the "mayor"?
I don't know what you want, but I know I can get it for you with a minimum of fuss.  Money, jewels, a very big ball of string...
Selina!  Selina Kyle!?  You're fired!  And Bruce -- Bruce Wayne! Why are you dressed up as Batman?
You killed me, Batman killed me, Penguin killed me.  Three lives down.  Got enough bullets to finish me off?
I'll warm ya!  I got hot mitts --!
Are you perchance a registered voter?  I'm also a mayoral prospect.
Yes.  <u>Yes</u>.  Boyfriend trouble ..?
... eight, seven...
Well, um... funny thing, your penguins... they're not responding to the launch command.  Fact they're kind of turned around now... Like someone jammed our signal...
Yawn.  That coulda come from anywhere.
Don't look, Oswald.  It's a surprise.
Bu ... wh ... I ... I mean ...
I could teach her my "French flipper" trick...
He didn't even lose a limb, an eyeball ... bladder control ..
I don't.  So, no.
Working late?  I'm touched.
Why, how industrious.  And how did you open protected files, may I ask?
... Where did curiosity get the cat?
It's good to see you again, Uncle. I've missed you.
Find my brother Wilfred.  Give him This.  I have duties he must fulfill in my stead.  Only family can be trusted.
Uncle Alfred?
Well, I hope you'll stay with us.
I am as well as can be expected.
I've spent my whole life trying to beat back death.  What good are all my heroics now if I can't save you?
It's good to see you.
What is it?
Their new computer sciences division.  How did you know?
Please be looking for me.
I could have made it, you know.  I didn't need your help.
This is to replace the bike I lost. I'll get you the rest.
Paying someone to prepare your meals and do your laundry and clean your dishes, you call that family?
Youwsa!  Nothing but air.
You were a great scientist once. Don't squander your genius on evil.
Watch the first step.
I'm totally over her.  Positively.
She's still alive.  He's adapted his freezing technology to reverse McGregor's Syndrome.  He's even found a cure for the early stages of the disease.
I guess we'll just have to kill her.
If we could relay the sunlight-
What can I do for you, Doctor?  A research grant?  A hospital wing?
Tell me, billionaire, would you warm faster to my pleas if I looked more like Ms. January here?
That's gotta hurt.
I need the Wayne Diamonds.
McGregor's Syndrome.  That's what Freeze's wife had.
Or what?  No one can capture Ivy but the big bad Bat.  Crap!  You just want her for yourself.  Don't you?  Answer me, damn it!
I love that belt.  What are you, about a fifty Big and Tall?
My reserves are exhausted.  I must have the gems that power my suit.
You will rescue my wife
Their bones will turn to ice.  Their blood will freeze in my hands.
Yes.  I shall replay the world for sentencing me to a life without the warmth of human comfort.  I will blanket the city in endless winter. First Gotham and then the world.
Inspired, Ms. Ivy.
Prepare for a bitter harvest. Winter has come at last.
I'm glad you came.  I can't breathe without you.
You should have heeded your pointy- eared pal.  These lips can be murder.
...Our original sponsor had no stomach for military applications. he cut the funding for our work -
The dreams again, sir?
...Would it be a terrible imposition to ask you to take better care of your equipment?
...The night Batman was born.  What was I doing in the fields that night, Alfred? What sent me running out into that storm? I keep dreaming about it but I just can't remember.
Actually, he took the car.
Why do I keep doing this?
Could I let Batman go? For Dick. For me. Could I leave the shadows? Have a life. Friends. Family...
There's one other thing. I feel..
Letters in the alphabet.
And another name for Mystery?
Welcome, Master Grayson. I'm Alfred.
...dual personalities. Abnormal psychology. Washington's poster child for the criminally insane. I read your work.
Why's that?
Bats aren't rodents, Dr. Meridian.
Now black rubber.
I haven't had much luck with women...
Help Chase. I'll be back.
Welcome to my parlor said the Riddler to the Bat. How's tricks?
Wait. I have a riddle for you.
I see without seeing. To me, darkness is as clear as daylight. What am I?
Call my secretary, she'll set something up.  Factory looks great, folks.  Keep up the good work.
La'chiem.
How can I help you, Mr. Wayne?
My opinion. This letter writer is a total wacko.
Patient apparently suffers from acute obsessional syndrome with potential homicidal styles. Work better for you?
Look, I'd love to keep chatting-
That kid is amazing.
Me? I'm easy. Especially after a couple of martinis.
He sure did.
In a sense we are all two people. The side we show in daylight. And that side we keep in shadow.
Touchy, touchy.
And the beast slouches towards Bethelem.
There's something I want to talk with you about. It's...Well, we.. I...
Your memories are repressed. They're trying to break through. Relax. Try to remember-.
...Not the bat?
You can't-.
Chase?
It's Dr. Meridian. Chase. Do you remember me?
Yo. Charlie. Gimmie an order of brain deep-fry. Extra well done. Hold the neurons.  Patient exhibits symptoms of psycho neural overload. Notation: obviously higher settings can be dangerous to the subject.  Riddle me this, Fred. What is everything to someone and nothing to everyone else? Your mind of course. And now mine pumps with the power of yours.  New from Brain-bok. Da pump. Think faster. Reason higher. Out-cog-nate every homey on the court of life. Da pump. Yeah.  Ho! Mark. I sense an odd penchant for the anagramatic. The acrostic. The crypto-graphic. What doth this bode? Answer me Marcutio, you little runt.  Fred, I must confess you were a wonderful appetizer. Simply divine. But now I yearn for a meal of substance. The main course. A wide and varied palette. Ah, to taste the mind of a hero. A nobleman. A poet.  A chick in a short skirt wouldn't be so bad either.
Wait! You said you'd let me go!
How'd you find us?
No.  Wait...
Sure, E = MC squared. Until you factor in more than three dimensions. Then... Damn. Hit us again.
Not until you do that thing I like.  On se tue pour des mesnonges. J'ai gache ma vie...  Woah. Harsh toke.
Go ahead. You can say it.
B-12.
Yes?
Excuse me, sir.  Commissioner Gordon was compelled to leave - -very unexpectedly.  He asked me to convey his regrets.
I know the feeling. It won't last.  He's a long way ahead of where I was at his age.
I'll have to ask you for that film.
The Joker is a murderer. And you were as good as dead. So --
... How long have I been out?
Is this what you wanted?
"This is Miss Vale." -- That felt redundant.
See, I don't know how it happened... she's a smart girl and you are an extraordinary screwed-up guy... but she's in love with you.
Do you want a drink?
Do you sail?
Two drinks and I start swinging from the rooftops.  Look, I bore myself silly.  Let's talk about you. How the hell did you wind up in Corto Maltese?
What did you see?
God.  You would.  Come on, Bruce.  I just want to get two drinks in you.  As an experiment.
All street mimes should be executed.
I know it's late. I -- Are you there?
I'm sorry I had to stand you up today. I'd like to make it up to you.
I'm sorry, she hung up. What are --
MOVE! Can't you do something??
I'm on top of it.  If there's a problem --
Five stories, straight down. There was no blood in the body.
It's me.  "Sugar Bumps."
Jack, listen -- we'll cut a deal --
Jack - - please - - WIPE THAT LUNATIC GRIN OFF YOUR FACE.
Please! We'll talk. Just tell us what you expect.
I've seen worse.  Much worse.
I'll see you burn.  I'll see you dead -- GET AWAY FROM ME!!
Burned out.  I need a vacation.
God, Vick, a girl could get hurt doing this.
You are on drugs.
Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU SEE THAT?!
Yeeees?
Okay.  It's not a problem... Let's just sit ... I'11 talk to the gallery ...
shhh...
Two dollars please.
Big day today, huh? 78
It's very good Bernie.
'Emergency measures, in your book means sack people right?
Great day.  At last we can start getting out of debt and concentrating on the future.
We'll be able to start this afternoon.  I'11 pipe the guide to every video screen in the gallery.  Now, that'll impress the Governor.
What a pleasure, Governor Reynolds.  I'd like you to meet some of our staff here. .
Okay, that'll do.  The Governor's here in half an hour.  We have to be totally ready then.  No excuses.  Period!
The thing is, sir, I've just been giving the painting a very thorough inspection, with the help of Dr Bean here - and we feel the time's come for Whistler's Mum to have her first face-lift.
Of course.
Welsh again.
Hey, En, nice bike'- but remember: any kids you have are gonna look just like its handsome driver.
We need you urgently in C Theatre.
I've known soldiers who've had their heads blown off who were more intelligent than you two.  Not only have you failed to protect your most valuable possession from theft - but you didn't even know it'd been stolen!  I'd sooner buy heroin from the guy who sells drugs outside my grandson's school than anything from you guys.
Shut up, Kevin.
Huh huh huh. He said "anus."
Whoa, check it out Beavis. I didn't know Anderson had a Camper.
Nnnnooo. Oooooh nooooo.
Actually, we just wanna watch TV...
Huh huh huh huh huh huh.
Huh huh huh. I'm ready for love.
Heh heh. We're in Washington!
Damn, huh huh.
Hey Butt-Head, I'm starting to feel weird. I think I'm freaking out.
Uh, you first.
Hey Butt-Head it's that chick!
Yeah, heh heh. Umm, isn't Seattle in Washington? Heh heh... 'cuz I was thinking maybe we could go see Hole.
Heh heh. Fire. Heh heh Aaaaeeehhhhg!!!
I always thought there was something wrong with him. Heh heh heh.
Aaaah. TeeeVeeeee, heh heh.
Beavis.
I hope to score big there myself. I'm mostly going to be doing the slots.
Oh, there are so many slots you won't know where to begin.
Really? I poop too much.
Uh... No,  I poop too much. Then I get tired.
Hey, Butt-Head, it's that slut from the plane!
Does that say Xanax?
We got nothing, Chief. We tore the place apart. We can only legally hold her for another couple of hours.
They look like a couple of kids chief.
Damn right. Bork, we're dealing with real pros here. My opinion, terrorists... What's the scoop on that stolen unit?
Jesus Jumped-Up Christ! If this were to fall into the wrong hands...
What the hell...? Bork! That bus we picked up. Where was it headin'?
We just cleared all four floors. No sign of him.
Here she is. Her name's Dallas. She ain't as sweet as she looks. She stole everything from me. Ya gotta watch out, 'cause she'll do you twice as fast as you'd do her.
Who sent ya?
Muddy! Sonofabitch! Hold it. What's he payin' ya?
Ten grand? That cheap-ass... I got a better deal for ya. I'll double it. I'll pay ya twenty if you go back there and do mah husband.
You'll be rich!
Yeah, I want to get one coat on the wardrobe and then I'll help you.
Oh no.
Jane said we should sell the house to someone with a family.
We should be flattered that she wants to sell our house.
Anything happen while I was away?
Cabin fever, hon?
Is this a punishment for something we did in life?  What can we do?
Adam, you had a photo of Big Foot!
Has anything been simple so far? From the look of the shovel, we dig.
Honey, I think that was a mistake.
Maybe they'll leave now.  That snake was a pretty nasty customer.
<u>Adam</u>!  Why did you build a whorehouse?  Have you ever been to...?
Lydia, believe me... we know... all the hard stuff is the same over here.  You're going to be who you are... whether you're alive or dead ... and over here -- it's... It's flat... there's no food, no colors ... you can't smell the flowers.  If we knew then what we know now we'd have been more careful...
What...?
Oh, Adam, don't tease her.  You never got an A in science in your life!
What?
What is going on?
Okay.  But that Betelgeuse sure seemed mad.
This is <u>my</u> town.
Folks, be reasonable here.  I'm at your service.  You be the judge. I'm a harmless guy.  Try me.
Yes.  I evaluate individual cases and determine if help is needed, deserved, and available.
We're very unhappy.
No.
The whorehouse was my idea. I want Betelgeuse out of the picture!  We've got some serious talking to do.
I don't wear that stuff to <u>bed</u>. Besides, there's <u>nothing</u> wrong with it.  I'm getting out of here.
So, <u>never</u> let Beetle Juice out. Never.  Besides...  We're thinking about letting everyone stay... You and your father and mother can stay too.
How'd you do on the science test?
Hi, Barb!  I'm glad I caught you. I heard you were on vacation!
You could double the size of your hardware store!  You'll be rich.
Mr. and Mrs. Maitland?  I've come for the last time.  Where are you?  Barb...
Well, yes, of course.  It's great over here.  You'll meet all the greats.  James Dean.  Buddy Holly.  'The little things a you say and do... make me want to be with you-a-hoo.'
Minor problem.  The rules.  I can't tell it to you.  But... do you know how to play charades?
Your name is <u>Beetle Juice</u>?  Yecch! That's as bad as <u>Deee</u>lia <u>Deee</u>tz.
You were the snake!  Right?  I know.  I saw you.
Can you help <u>me</u>?
I can't believe that we're eating Cantonese.  Is there no Szechuan up here?  Hunan?
Otho'll know what to do.
What do you think, honey?
Yeah, maybe if he's nice, he'll let me hang myself from a rope in his barn.
Where is your mother?
Just a minute, Maxie.  Somebody...
Are they suffering?
We'll be <u>the</u> art center of summer New York.  I'll teach those phony gallery creeps to refuse my sculpture.  And when Otho and I get through with this house, you people are not going to recognize it.
I think the reason is they were trying to scare you, and you didn't get scared --
All right, you dead people!  Come on out, or we'll break down this door and drag you out on the ropes you hanged yourself with!
That was the single most unattractive window treatment I have ever seen in the entire of my existence.
Otho, I can<u>not</u> <u>live</u> with these cheap domestic floor tiles.
Now, Lydia... Favor us about your ghosts.
Look at that <u>detail</u>!
Otho, that's terrible.
They don't want to come down.
Yes. Are you planning on making any sort of claim against the Rand's?
... And please call me Robert.
Chauncey, there you are. What are you doing on that leg?
... Benjamin has been hounding me to allow him to address the annual meeting of his Financial Institute today, but obviously, the strain would be impossible... How about here, Chauncey, any soreness?
Yes. I love Eve very much.
I know exactly what you mean. Today the businessman is at the mercy of kid-lawyers from the SEC. All they want to do is regulate our natural growth! It's happening across the country!
Some pain is to be expected...  ... And I think what would be best for the two of you is a good night's rest.  ... It's late, I'm afraid it's time for my patients to prepare for bed.
And you, Benjamin, must be strong and brave for me. Turn over, please.
No more, Robert... No more needles...
Not necessary, but preferable. I don't think he'll be a bother, he seems like a most refreshing sort of man.
... He walked off...
... And he told us that he had been living there since he was a child, working as a gardener. He showed us a room in the garage, where he said he stayed, and I... Well, I didn't really believe him, of course - but why the act?
Well, Mr. President... They don't quite know what to think.
I understand. I've never seen anything like this on television.
Mr. Gardiner, I have a telephone call for you. Sidney Courtney, the financial editor of the Washington Post.
Oh, Mr. Gardiner, I've been looking all over.
Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening' just called.
Fine. They felt that since you had such close ties with the President, you would be a splendid choice.  ... Can I help you? Are you looking for something?
I would like to watch television.
I can see that it must be very important for you to stay informed of all the latest events.
... Would you like us to notify anyone for you?
... And Ben is just mad about you - you've lifted his spirits so - it's just... Well, it's just a real pleasure having you with us.
Yes... I know, Chauncey.
Good. I'm glad to hear that.  ... How did you like meeting the President?
I'll be all right, Chauncey you go ahead with Mrs. Aubrey...
Oh. Well, we can fix up one of Ben's for you tomorrow night. Sophie insists an Black Tie.
... Good night, Chauncey.
Well, it seems you've been described as one of the architects of the President's speech. And your own comments from the 'This Evening' show are quoted side by side with the President's.
I know...  ... So are you, Chauncey ...  ... Do you mind my being here, like this?
Yes.
Dearest, you uncoil my wants; desire flows within me, and when you watch me my passion dissolves it. You set me free. I reveal myself to myself and I am drenched and purged.
I'm sorry to disturb you, Mr. Gardiner, I know you must be very busy.
Can you see well?
... Are you sure you like it?
Regretfully, Mrs. Rand - I shall yield the pleasure of your company to others.
And I have noticed in you a certain reticence regarding political issues - so why not a coming together? An interchange of opinion? We may find, my friend, that we are not so far from each other, not so far!
Yes. Tell me, Mr. Gardiner - do you by any chance enjoy Krylov's fables? I ask this because there is something... there is something Krylovian about you.
A gardener! Well put, Chauncey excellent! Isn't that what a businessman is? A gardener? A person that makes flinty soil productive with the labor of his own hands, who waters it with the sweat from his own brow, and who creates a place of value for his family and community? Yes, Chauncey, what a brilliant metaphor -- yes, indeed, a productive businessman is a laborer in his own vineyard.
I think what my most insightful friend is saying, Mr. President, is that we welcome the inevitable seasons of nature, yet we are upset by the seasons of our economy.
... You know, Chauncey, there's something about you... You're direct, you grasp things quickly and you state them plainly. You don't play games with words to protect yourself. I feel I can speak to you frankly... You know what I was talking to you about last night?
And, please, Chauncey - don't rush your decision. I know you're not a man to act on the spur of the moment.
Yes. I would like to escort Eve.
... Chauncey... Chauncey...
Watch? You mean just watch me? Doing it alone?
Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand?
May I help you, Mr. Gardiner?
Might you have a birth certificate, Mr. Chance?
... Evening, Chance.
Well, ain't that the truth...
Mr. Gardiner, how very nice to have you with us this evening.
Yes... Of course, you know, Mr. Gardiner, that I always prefer an open and frank conversation with my guests, I hope you don't object to that.
Come now, Mr. Gardiner, before his speech at the Financial Institute the President consulted with you and Benjamin Rand, did he not?
I know that, Mr. Gardiner.
... Are you waiting for someone? An appointment?
You live here?  ... We don't have any record of that.
Then how about medical records? Could you give us the name of your doctor, or your dentist?
... We shall need some proof of your having resided here, Mr. Chance.
What are your plans now, Mr. Chance?
Move out? I don't understand, Thomas.
Well, Mr. Gardiner, that's just fine with me - I'm a man that appreciates a frank discussion... Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner...
Do you agree with Ben, Mr. Gardiner? Are we finished? Or do you think we can stimulate growth through temporary incentives?
... In the garden?
... Gardiner is laconic, matter-of fact. The scuttlebutt is that he's a strong candidate for one of the vacant seats on the board of First American. But before we can do any sort of a piece on the man, we're going to need facts on his background...  ... Kinney, what did you come up with?
... Skip the levity, Kinney - what have you got?
Sure, try again - where? There's nothing, it's like he never existed!
Good evening, Mrs. Rand.
I shall take the gentleman to the third floor guest suite, ma'am. Dr. Allenby is standing by.
And look who you brought with!
... Is it me? Is there something I've done?
It's your damn job. It never happened when you were a senator...
Quietly, please. Mr. Gardiner, for one, understands our language.
Kaufman, I'm going to need information on Mr. Chauncey Gardiner's background.
He's an advisor and close personal friend of Rand's! For Christ sakes, they have volumes of data on Benjamin!
This information goes back three days. I want the standard file, you know that.
No, she flew up to Boston for another charity event. She'll be sorry to have missed you.
Nonsense, Mr. President - I thank you for coming to spend time with a dying man.
I'll get right to the point, Larry. I'm a puppet now...
Malkovich.
Enjoy.
The Great Mantini doesn't need a day job.
Some sort of childhood trauma, she thinks. Possible feelings of inadequacy as a chimp. Interesting, huh?
I was worried.
I was, wasn't I?  I was John fucking Malkovich!  Take me back, Craig.
You've always hated the animals.
I'm giving them up. I've changed. I've found a new focus.
Sometimes we're forced to make hard decisions.  I'd like for us to stay together, Craig. You know, platonically, if that's possible. I truly value our friendship.
It was lovely being you being Malkovich, my dear. I'd never seen the passionate side of sweet Maxine before, or her actual tits for that matter. If only, I've been thinking to myself, if only I could actually feel what Malkovich feels, rather than just see what he sees... And then, dare I say it, if only I could control his arms, his legs, his pelvis, and make them do my bidding.
Ah, but you're forgetting one thing, Lambchop.
You didn't do anything about it out of respect for the fact that she wouldn't let you near her with a ten foot pole, which is, by the way, about nine feet, nine inches off the mark anyway.
You're not a monster, Craig. Just a confused man.
A better friend.
I don't know. There's a small community of us. We have a place they don't know about. We're happy. We'll keep trying to figure out a way. Come stay with us. Join the struggle.
Maxine...
So how was it?
Really? For most people it's a rather pleasant experience. What exactly did you...
With all respect, sir, I discovered that portal. Its my livelihood.
Tell me, Dr. Schwartz, what do you feel you can bring to LesterCorp?
You think so, eh? Which comes first, L or... Glooph?
No. I understand perfectly.
Just one. Why is this floor so short?
One hundred and five. Carrot juice.  Lot's of it. I swear, it's almost not worth it. I piss orange. Oh, and I, have to piss sitting down... like a godamn girly... every fifteen minutes. But nobody wants to die, Schwartz.
Dr. Lester...
No sir, not at all. It's just that I'm going to open my own business and...
Moving story.
Listen. I'm Craig Schwartz, just starting out at LesterCorp.
And fifty other lines to get into a girl's pants.
What?
Yeah.
Who told you?
I am dubious, but I don't welsh. Meet me at The Stuck Pig. Seven o'clock. You're late, I walk. So help me, if I find out you cheated.
Made it. Maxine. Maxine, Maxine, Maxine.
Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.
Tickets to Malkovich?
Really?  But, Maxine, can of worms! End of the world! Illusory nature of existence!
Lotte, this is so good...
Lotte? Is that you?
So that's the story of 7 1/2. Since the rents are considerably lower this floor has been adopted by businesses which for one reason or another are forced to cut corners After all... the overhead is low! Ha ha ha!
Hi. Wendy! What're you up to in this vacant office.
You can be John Malkovich.
I suppose I could come to him in a dream. I don't know. That's the best I can think of right now.
Yes, but you see, someone else was talking through my mouth.
I'm done with her now. Tonight really creeped me out.
I don't know anything about her. What if she's some sort of witch or something?
Hi. Have you done Malkovich yet?
Yes?
We have to meet.
I'm sorry, did you just call me "Lotte"?
Something was making me talk. Some Goddamn thing was making me move. I gotta get out of here.
Don't con me, Maxine. We're over. I just let you up here to tell you that, and to tell you that I'm taking you and Schwartz to court.
Well, we'll have all the money in Malkovich's bank account, plus he still gets acting work occasionally.
Shut up!  Sorry, dear, I lost control for a minute.
This is it, lover. You're stepping onto that stage a nobody and presto-change-o, you're coming back the greatest puppeteer the world has ever seen.
I am not asking for alms, but rather the ear of a kind man with a noble heart.
This Saturday - you coming to Call or what?
Oh, I remember bits and pieces of all of'em I guess..Halle, of course..I had Halle a lifetime. Almost twenty years... My two girls, sold and gone before I could even a heard about it, and them without their grown up teeth yet. My third child, my son after Halle...I let that straw boss have me for four months so's I could keep that boy. Next year, he had him traded for lumber anyway and me pregnant with his child. I couldn't love that child. I wouldn't. Not any of the rest either. God take what He would....and He did...
YOU NEVER FORGOT ME?
WILL YOU STAY?
You gave me the bad dreams. You left me behind...
Well, is it now? How you getting along?
You think she sure 'nough your sister?
Well, if you want my opinion...
You grown.
And Paul D...you don't have to stay 'way, but be careful how you talk to my mama, hear?
I heard your mother took sick, that so?
I never went to those woodland services but she was always nice to me. Always. Never be another like her.
They getting older now and I can't take care of 'em like I used to. More and more they keep asking me to sleep over night. Now, I don't want to quit these people but they can't have all my days and nights too. I got my own family needs me. It'll take some convincing but maybe you could come after supper - take care of your mama during the day, then earn a little something at night, how's that?
They good whitefolks?
Won't you be late for work?
Out where?
Somebody new there. A woman. Thought you might know who she is.
True.
It's her, ain't it?
Anything white floating around in the woods - if it don't got a shotgun, it's something the Lord tells me I don't want no part of.
What run him off? Tell me that!
You?
You didn't tell me that. I thought he already knew.
Oh yeah. Oh that's load off. I thought everybody gone crazy.
Aw, girl. Don't cry...Me and you, we got more yesterday than anybody. We need some kind of tomorrow...
Here's the money, and the phone. Please, Dude, follow whatever instructions they give.
Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that: Her life is in your hands.
Hey, man, I'm not--
Okay.  Vee take ze money you haf on you und vee call it eefen.
I FUCK YOU!  I FUCK YOU!
Excuse me?
Can we just rent it from you?
This is a hundred and eighty dollars.
What the fuck is he talking about?
Fuckin' A.
What tied the room together, Dude?
I was bowling--
Yeah Walter, what's your point?
Burkhalter.
Who's in pyjamas, Walter?
Are they gonna hurt us, Walter?
--So he says, "My son can't hold a job, my daughter's married to a fuckin' loser, and I got a rash on my ass so bad I can't hardly siddown. But you know me.  I can't complain."
Please!  Please!
That's a Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce Business Achiever award, which is given--not necessarily given every year!  Given only when there's a worthy, somebody especially--
Wonderful woman.  We were very--
No, they--
Yes, heh--
1972 Pontiac LeBaron.
Papers.  Just papers.  You know, my papers.  Business papers.
Wouldn't miss the semis.  How things been goin'?
Of course, you do get the good with the bad.  The new technology permits us to do exciting things with interactive erotic software.  Wave of the future, Dude.  100% electronic.
Me?  How would I know?  The only reason she ran off was to get away from her rather sizable debt to me.
Who the fuck are you?  Why've you been following me?  Come on, fuckhead!
Francis Donnelly.  Pleased to meet you.
Oh yeah?
Right, but let me explain something about that rug--
Shit yeah, the achievers.
She is most definitely the perpetrator and not the victim.
Her "co-star" in the beaver picture?
Roy Orbison. . . Pink Floyd.
Jeez.  I miss vinyl.
Please Jeffrey.  I don't want to be responsible for any delayed after- effects.
It's not my father's money, it's the Foundation's.  Why did he think you had it?  And who does?
Jeffrey--
He helps administer the charities now, and I give him a reasonable allowance.  He has no money of his own.  I know how he likes to present himself; Father's weakness is vanity. Hence the slut.
So...that doctor.
No, the, uh, police chief of Malibu. A real reactionary. . . So your father. . . Oh man, I get it!
What's your point, Walter?
What's the point of--we all know who was at fault, so what the fuck are you talking about?
What the fuck are you--
Yeah, but--
Hey, man, if my fucking ex-wife asked me to take care of her fucking dog while she and her boyfriend went to Honolulu, I'd tell her to go fuck herself.  Why can't she board it?
Walter, you can't do that.  These guys're like me, they're pacificists. Smokey was a conscientious objector.
Okay then.  We play Quintana and O'Brien next week.  They'll be pushovers.
I'm perfectly calm, Dude.
Those rich fucks!  This whole fucking thing-- I did not watch my buddies die face down in the muck so that this fucking strumpet--
The fucking point is--
What the hell is this?
Oh shit.  Walter.
They hung up, Walter!  You fucked it up!  You fucked it up!  Her life was in our hands!
Ya see?  Nothing is fucked up here, Dude.  Nothing is fucked.  These guys are fucking amateurs--
...Huh?
There is no fucking hand-off, Walter! At a wooden bridge we throw the money out  of the car!
No, Walter!  I said I thought she kidnapped herself!  You're the one who's so fucking certain--
Walter, what'm I gonna tell Lebowski?
Who gives a shit, Walter?  What about that poor woman?  What do we tell--
Yeah, and in the meantime what do I tell Lebowski?
"Our" car, Walter?
It's been stolen, Walter!  You fucking know it's been stolen!
How the fuck should I know?  I do know that nothing about it indicates--
You want a toe?  I can get you a toe, believe me.  There are ways, Dude.  You don't wanna know about it, believe me.
Well that's just, that's the stress talking, Dude.  So far we have what looks to me like a series of victimless crimes--
Lady, I got buddies who died face- down in the muck so you and I could enjoy this family restaurant!
I figure my only hope is that the big Lebowski kills me before the Germans can cut my dick off.
Yeah, thanks Walter.  That gives me a very secure feeling.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh.
Is this your homework, Larry?
Dude, please!. . .  Is this your homework, Larry?
Walter, listen, I'm at my place, I need you to come pick me up--
And you were divorced five fucking years ago.
Oh, shit.
There weren't any shots.
We're scattering the fucking ashes!
Shit Dude, I'm sorry--
Employed?
C'mon man, who're you gonna believe? Those guys are--we dropped off the damn money--
Well, she's back.  No thanks to you.
Put me down, you son of a bitch!
You come all the way down here to roust--
He's all yours. And I'm not your partner.
What?
Seems like he's doing me a favor, then.
You've been training two years to take me out.  Here I am, the big, bad vampire hunter.  So do it.
What was that?
Recognize him?
I've never seen anything like this.  The Reapers are as different from us as we are from you.  It's almost as if the virus is re-wiring their bodies, creating new, parasitic organs which consume the old ones.
He's right about one thing.  We do have to survive.
Anyone else make it?
Thank you.
Get real.  I was useful to Damaskinos as long as the hunt was still on.  Now that it's over, all bets are off.
You came back for me.
Let's just hope you've kicked the Thirst for good.  I'll be watching you close. You start to back-slide --
He's right.  They'll smell that you're human.  Stay here, watch our backs.
Where were you, Whistler?
Your security's for shit, kid.
And so will we.
Gonna try and OD Whistler on a retroviral cure.
So you're going to do this?
Listen, hillbilly, you are a cunt-hair away from cowboy heaven.
We want to attract them, not scare them off.
His name is Jared Nomak.
Gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile ramping.
Where'd you dig up this shit-bird anyway?
Hey, you think I don't know what's at stake here?  We practically compromised our whole operation to save your puckered old ass!  And for what?
Going on twenty years now.
Yeah, your little cootchie knew.
It's not very effective in direct sunlight, but it's a start. The goal, of course, is to be like you, "the Day-walker".
Is something wrong, my friend?
I am tired. Dawn is coming.
I can go to the police. I have blood samples back at the hospital. I can show them.
But, he could've --
What are you looking at?
Graffiti --
So many of them -- I still can't believe they're real.
You care about him, don't you?
How long have we been driving?
I never imagined I'd be so happy to see the sun rise --  It's over, isn't it?
Maybe it's time to start exploring other alternatives.
Please --
Curtis, it's three in the morning. I'm really not in the mood for one of your practical jokes.
How many of you are there?
LaMagra --
LaMagra isn't a physical being. He's a spirit, requiring a flesh and blood host in order to manifest himself.
I had a family once -- a wife, three daughters. Then a drifter named Deacon Frost came calling one evening --
--and if she ever did--
I need you to talk to me, talk to me about the dreams--about James, the other boys.
Try, please, Anna--
Not that I can see.
You killed Domini, didn't you, witch??
No!
Shit? This is from "Josh's Blair Witch Mix," man!
--but she was nicer then--sweeter-- she hadn't vomited twice already like today--
Yeah, so?
Whatzername--the "psychic" Anna hired.
No, the kids were actors, the townspeople were real. Her, the Sheriff, the Convenience Store guy--
Pardon me, I've had a few things on my mind--like putting this safari together.
Anna--
What?
--or someone--
This is a goddamn disaster. Let's just pack it up and go.
And what do you possibly think you're going to fucking see there?
I'm not going anywhere, 'til--
Just now?
Absolutely.
--hours before--
I know you're in there, you piece of shit!
So, I hear you're from New Mexico!
How'd you know they were--
I don't know yet.
Something happened to Anna in Burkittsville, in the woods, I don't know.
I'm the ebay Boy, remember? I can't exactly afford that kind of equipment.
Can't you like just divine it?
I got a friend at a Lab. I could get the whole thing blown-up, enhanced--
From-the-movie-Mary-Brown, Trailer Park Bible Psycho?
You're not only an idiot, you're a goddamn <u>child</u>.
What movies?
Three people: two guys, a girl-- sleeping in the same motel room, the same tent night after night.
What about night?
Used to be a meat-packing plant. Slaughter on the ground floor-- carcasses schlepped up on this thing for dissection and grinding and--
Where <u>is</u> it?
--Cotter, where can I get on-line?
Boy Kurth.
It's <u>freezing</u>.
Who?
Hold this.
This is her equally on-the-rag boy- friend, Nick Leavitt--
We're not making Blair Witch II here.
Okay, but--
There's four other angles, man, we haven't even--
Well, she's got to be <u>somewhere</u> here.
Just let it go, I've got you!
That's almost a year's worth of work!  Scumbags! Oh, Jesus, Jesus....
Pointless.
Someone want to tell me what's going on--
What's that?
That'd be up on your shoulder, maybe your lower back.
What is it you thought you saw on that tape?
Elly Kedward?
Are you alright?
What?
--bullshit--
The good old days: toasting marsh- mallows over a burning witch.
You think....there could've been something up in those woods that Anna--
I can't do it!
Gothic rune--the letter "S."
I should check on Anna.
No. We <u>all</u> go.
Like a blueprint for disembowelment.
Good morning, Sheriff's Office.
Jesus, I got a hangover. Want a drink?
What?! Did Ray tell you that?
What was that?
Don't go to the bar, Ray. I know him, that ain't a good idea.
Well... I'm not gonna put you out of your bed...
I could've sworn I heard something.
Uh-huh.
...You all right?
...Ray?
Why didn't you get into bed?
...That's the only thing they told us in the service that was worth a goddamn--Where the hell's my windbreaker?
...But first I gotta know what happened.
So how long have you know Meurice?
He needs a room, Dusty.
...What're you gonna do in Houston?
...You know that car?
What did you take these for?
Well, I don't know... Call it a fringe benefit.
If the pay's right I'll do it.
...Gee, I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me what you want me to do or is it a secret?
Yeah. Is it...
...What?
Yeah...
Just the ten thousand'll be fine.
Deuce in the corner needs help.
Where was I?
I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have.
Shit Ben! How the shit are ya?
Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. goddam!!! This is the suavest guy I know. look at you. You're one beautiful fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. shit, that is too fuckin' much. Where's those glasses. this beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. it makes me puke.
These are beautiful. How's the case coming?
Okay. come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!!
Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon.  I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different.  He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.
Yes, but.
Look at these. What are these?
Frank. he didn't mean it. Leave him alone. come on. He didn't mean it.
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what?
What do you want from me?
Don't.  I don't like that. What do you want?
Next Christmas. Is he Santa Claus who has left a present for Dorothy? What was it? An ear? Another ear?!!  What was it?
. I. uh.
I came back to help you. You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know where I live. if you need to. come to where I live. O.K.?
Yes.
Come in.
It used to make me laugh .but.
No. how could he?. Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  . don't hate me.
Shut up.
Do you love me?
Dorothy. no!
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
Come on. I wancha to meet a frienda mine. Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too.
Come on. you brought it up. Do you know anything?
Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long . the police are watching.
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
Now, how are you going to do that?
What will I say when she comes to the door?
Now. we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window .alright?
Are you alright?
Brilliant.
Yeah. but.
What's with Mike?
You want a Dairy Queen?
You want to tell me about it?
You saw a lot in one night.
No, silly - I'm still in school you know. but I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey.
You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.
Shoot.
Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.
You want to dance?
Dorothy! ... Dorothy!
Probably not. no. Why?
... Sandy?.
I'm going out for awhile.
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
Can I use the car tonight?
Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
Mike's gotta go.  Nice to meet you.
I've been holding this shit for him for three weeks.  You tell Diego I don't appreciate it.  You tell him I want my money by Friday.  Can you do that?
Yes.  Jack Stevens is already a very busy man.  Along with many others.  You shouldn't stay away so long.
Three-hundred kilos is a very big load, Georgie.  Why don't we start small?
Blanca, por favor.
Are you sure this guy is cool?
Just everything.  You.  California.  The beach.  This spot right here.  I feel like I belong here, you know?  It just feels right.
We're gonna call it California sinsemilla.  Sounds exotic.
Promise me that we'll never be like them.  I don't want to wind up like that.
Surprise.
What, and miss all the fun?  C'mon, not a chance.  So, what's the verdict?
You can't sell this to your friends.
You can't sell this to your friends.
Mr. Jung, don't you have an agreement or understanding with the United States Government in connection with your testimony in this case?
I demand to know everything.  I do not trust six-hundred thousand dollars of coca to someone I don't know.
The coca is my responsibility!
Why are you speaking?
You.  Your responsibility is over.  You do not fly.  You are not a pilot.  You are not a distributor.  You introduced us to Mr. Stevens and the use of his airplane.  That is all.  You make a percentage.  A generous one.  And you're lucky to get that.
Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
Goodness.
And I only deal with you?
I don't think so.
Happy Birthday, George.  Mirtha invited me.
George?  You better get yourself a good lawyer this time.  We're gonna nail your ass to the wall on this one.
What do you got there, Diego?
That's over fifty-thousand dollars profit per kilo.
Jesus Christ.  Jesus fucking Christ.
How many kilos can we fit in these planes?
A million dollars for our first run is not bad, George.
This is only part of the business, George.  A very small part.  Don't worry, there is so much more to do. Which reminds me, I need a favor from you.  I must go to Colombia.
I'm calling it three.
There's no room.
I'm married, George.  Me.  I can't believe it.  Can you believe I'm married, George?
George, I am happy to see you.  How are you, my brother?
I did not.
You'd better kill me now, Diego, because you're a dead man.
He's in tachycardia.  George, your heart is racing.  Have you been using drugs?
In how long?  A week?
Barbara.
Thank you.  Have you been getting the money I sent you?
It's a family heirloom.
Mirtha comes from a very wealthy family.
So, this is the man who takes fifty kilos and makes them disappear in one day?
The man in the garden.  He was full of courage.
But, never mind.  I am thinking we can do much together.  This problem with Diego, the stolen car, the jail, is very silly business.  To release him from the carcel, it causes me much inconvenience. The fifty kilos could have been a big problem.  And I don't like problems.
So, you are wanting to sell the cocaine for me in your country, George?
It is very difficult.  Diego makes me a lot of money.  If Diego goes so does the money.  You were an excellent teacher, George.  When the student has learned well, the teacher is no longer necessary.  We must remember we have wives, friends, familia.  Even familia that has not been born.  But sometimes, we must forget as well.  I am like you. I must teach the lesson.  We want to teach the lesson.  But we cannot.  We must remember that life is the teacher.
Life will take care of everybody. Diego, me, you.  It is the teacher.
I'm sorry, George.
There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it.
I know.
No, it's good.  You have a family.  It's good if it makes you happy.  It's nice to have nice things.  Are you happy, son?
Tell Mom, you know...
You hear about your old friend, Diego?
What the fuck are you talking about, man?
No, that's alright.
I haven't seen one dollar from you.  You haven't paid me one cent in child support, alimony.
She's getting big.  Getting her own ideas.
Hey, George.  You okay?
Is she here?  Is she coming?
Yeah.
What?
Let me ask you something.  If you could go anywhere in the world, anywhere, where would you want to go?
California?  You can go anywhere in the world.  India.  Tibet.  Australia. Paris.  And you choose California?
What is it?  A Disneyland thing?
I'm thinking about getting out of town this week.  You want to come with me?
Yeah.  Go out there, check it out, see what it's like.  I've got some stuff to do this week, but I'm thinking maybe Thursday.  Thursday after school.
But I want to put her name on the list for tomorrow.  My daughter.
Because she's visiting me.
Mr. Jung, do you know Diego Delgado?
You saved my life, Dulli.  You'll never fucking know.  All you guys.  Everyone just got a raise.  Instead of ten percent, you get fifteen.
Marijuana is illegal in my country, and I believe in yours, as well.  We must be careful.
Right on.
Yeah?
Okay.  So we need a source.  Where do we start?
Nice weed, huh?
What's the matter, George?  Something wrong?  You look like you just fucked your mother.
This is bullshit, George.  We're never going to find anything down there.
Look around. I've put everything at your disposal. Go take a look with your own eyes.
They seemed to be plausible this time. A general strike is a good argument for the UN.
It is an inevitable stage in revolutionary war; from terrorism, one passes to insurrection ... as from open guerrilla warfare one passes to real war, the latter being the determining factor ...
The law is often inconvenient, colonel ...
Go ahead! C'mon ... Repeat everything from the beginning, and then we'll let you go. Name ...
Second name.
Which "district" do you belong to?
You afraid of these ...?
I don't do that kind of thing.
You still haven't told me why you didn't let me kill him.
Be careful now. Unless you know how it works, it's better if you sit on the plank and move forward like this ...
It's good nobody is following us ...
No ...
No, and neither were my men.
Because they told us that we mustn't use weapons, now, when the time is right.
All right. See you tomorrow, Corbiere.
You seem to be very satisfied to have taken me alive ...
Are you ready, colonel?
It's very good -- because when the D.A's office saw it they assumed it was the end of the tape, otherwise they would have buried it.
Charlie -- are you going to make a point soon?
Take some time off.
Because he wasn't dead when she left, and even if he was, not reporting a natural death in a timely fashion isn't a crime.
Yeah.
About three hours.
What can we prove?
What induced it?
What would be the effect if someone secretly administered cocaine to Mr. Marsh and then induced him to make love?
What was the nature of the argument?
Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use cocaine?
Can you?
Suspicions maybe -- but suspicions aren't enough for a conviction.
I don't buy it and neither will a jury.
She's innocent.
Your Honor, I fail to see what Mrs Crawford's educational background has to do with this case.
Objection, Your Honor.  The fact that Mrs. Crawford heard Mr. Troxell reconstruct her sentence and decided to rephrase her words in a more intelligent manner for the court doesn't mean the incident never happened.
You don't know what you're talking about.
Objection.  The question calls for a conclusion on the part of the witness.
Objection!
Objection!  May I remind Mr. Dulaney that the person on trial here is Miss Lawson -- not Dr. Paley.
Miss Braslow -- I'm District Attorney John Cardenas.  You arrived at what time tonight?
Her name?
What about Miss Lawson?
Is it Marsh?
Who found him?
She was here?
How would you describe your sex life with Miss Lawson?
I know this is a very personal subject, but could you be a little more specific?
What kind of condition are you referring to?
Why not?
If you knew it was bad for you why did you do it?
What eventually happened to your relationship with Miss Lawson?
What kind of information?
-- And what did you suggest?
Isn't it true that later that night you tried to force yourself on Miss Lawson in the parking lot?
Well -- as I remember it, we had an argument.
Yes.
You're still angry, aren't you? Isn't it true that your whole story is nothing more than a vindictive attempt on your behalf to get back at Miss Lawson?
I may have been infatuated with her - - but I wouldn't perjure myself.
Did Mr. Marsh ever tell you that he had spoken to Miss Lawson about his illness?
Did you ever prescribe any medication for her cramps?
What did you prescribe for her?
October twenty-seventh.
I heard him say it.
Where did you meet him?
You don't really believe what the district attorney is saying about Miss Lawson, do you?
I've tried it.
No.
Yes.
--And that Mr. Marsh paid less attention to you?
Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money.  That must have made you pretty angry?
Yes.
P.M.
Isn't it true that you put the cocaine in the bottle?
What do you have in your purse?
Yes.
Are you going to represent me?
Do you think I did it?
You must have some feeling.  Some immediate impression.  A young, attractive woman, involved with an older man who leaves her everything in his will.  And the things that went on in that house.  Such wild sex.  What kind of picture does that paint?
Something like that.
How'd you meet Marsh?
This is your house.
I'm the photographer.
That's not an answer.
Yes -- she did.
Sorry.
You and me -- making love.
Alone?
Rebecca -- take these off.
What are you going you doing?
Rebecca -- we shattered a man's life in open court.
Andrew Marsh was a very wealthy man. A trial like this is going to put Cardenas in the spot-light.
Alright, I'll talk to her
Hey, you know better than that.  What did I teach you to say when someone is accused of doing something?
You know how it is sometimes when you're out playing ball with your friends?  How you're really concentrating on what you're doing -- and you lose track of time and you come home late and Mom yells at you?
This is not relaxing.
What's she like?
Humped
Why don't you talk to him now?
Is that alright, Frank?
Sharon, it's late.  Can we get to the point?
Working.  Charlie and I were going over some statements.
I was thinking that when the trial is over we'd all go skiing for a weekend.
You wouldn't like what you'd see. You don't know me anymore.  I don't know me anymore.
Not even if they're a dork?
No, we just had lunch at the hotel with my brother and his new wife. She told me all the dirt. I forgot how interesting things can get around here. It was so good to see them. The last time we visited they were in Europe. He is doing so well. He ordered champagne. For lunch! I nearly died.
You said it in that tone! Like you were angry at me, my brother, at the world for forcing you to eat a nice lunch!
Maybe it's an Italian thing. Their mother was Italian.
How bizarre!
I do not need instructions from you to bathe!  I knew you'd do this! I knew I'd come all the way here and be shut out as usual! I came to be here for you! I didn't have to come!  Lord knows I was never much welcome in this house before. Apparently dead or alive, nothing's changed.
He dropped them off at Betty's mom. Where's Steve?
I thought everything WAS arranged.
I remember a Mrs. Delaney but Mama told me years ago she died.
Yeah.
Robert! Jesus! I'll kill him.
DAMN HIM! I knew mama wouldn't have thought of that herself. It was some damn perverted... photographic mind influencing her! When did the bastard die?
My Lord. It must feel real nice living inside your head with Peter Pan and the Easter Bunny.
Don't say that!
I found out who Lucy Delaney is.  Remember the Delaneys from Hillcrest Road?
Only about a thousand times. What do I do now? "What's good enough for mom is good enough for me?"
Madge?
Madge. Please. Something's happened. I've met someone. I've fallen in love in a way I've never thought could happen my entire life. It's our last day together. I feel like I'm going to die when he leaves. Please. Help me.
I can't describe it. I think it's from the loam in the soil. This very rich, earthy kind of... alive... No. No, that's not right. Can you smell it?
Uh... uh...  Umm... long time.
You just... got off the train because it looked pretty?
Oh, that's nice.
Oh. Michael's 17 and Carolyn's 16.
He's very... clean.
Feeling better?
Help cook?
What?
Then what happened?
"Making pictures." I like that. You really love what you do, don't you?
I'm sorry. That was...
You drink bug repellent?
Smells like dirt.
This "... Of what I call God and fools can Nature." Who wrote that?
Are you all right?
Do you ever regret it? The divorce, I mean.
But it's not the same.
No, I'm just saying --
Just because someone chooses to settle down and have a family doesn't necessarily mean they're hypnotized. Just because I've never seen a gazelle stampede doesn't mean I'm asleep in the world.
Okay. See you later.
You want to eat something?
Take me somewhere.
And arraccinos and zeppolis. Yes! I know it!
But you don't mind.
I just wondered. Why were you trouble?
You're somewhere else, where?
Uh-huh. And?
I don't know why I'm so tired all of a sudden.
Am I too heavy for you?
I... What do you want?
Routine! I don't have a routine. And if you think that's what this is -
What are you doing?
How do you know what I experience?
STOP IT!
I told you! I won't apologize for who I am.
For anyone. They'll never be able to live through the talk. Richard will never be able to. He doesn't deserve that. He hasn't hurt anyone in his life.
Robert. Please.  You don't understand -- no one does. When a woman makes the choice to marry, to have children -- in one way her life begins but in another way it stops. You build a life of details. You become a mother, a wife and you stop and stay steady so that your children can move. And when they leave they take your life of details with them. And then you're expected move again only you don't remember what moves you because no one has asked in so long. Not even yourself. You never in your life think that love like this can happen to you.
No. Don't do this.
Now?!  It's after eleven.
Again? Maybe you should see a doctor.
"I had forgotten this. I had somehow remembered it being more his fault, his decision. Then I remembered we made love in that field before we left for home. And I remembered it was my idea. I remembered tearing his shirt and biting his body, hoping he would kidnap me. I had forgotten that too. And I wondered, as I sat there... how many other things I'd forgotten."
Are you seeing Betty tonight?
Well, she's... she's real pretty and ... and she's got a cute shape... she's a good sport, ya know, for laughs and  ... she loves fried chicken wings and beer.
Oh my God...!
Your father was his best friend.  He loved Jeremiah.  So he must hate him the most of all now.  He'll take his time. But even if it is too late.  If your father is dead.  It's not over.  The door has to be closed.
Can you take a little extended solo right about now, funk soul brotha?
You soundin' like the old man now.
Shit.
Yeah, we can.  Least till after this weekend.  He ain't going nowhere.  We'll deal with it then.
We can climb out.
Is this Hell?
Don't poison your mind with that ghetto paranoia.  That's all just ways of people justifying their own failure.
Looking to score?
Yeah, we used to do the after-school b ball at Kenwood.  What it is?
I ain't interested.  And if you gonna sell it, don't sell it round here.
But.
It's all arranged for tonight.  Eddie Mack's gonna be there.  And Offisa Korruptsky, too.
Trust me, Jimmy, there's big money behind this.  Not just big.  BIG.  Like big business big.  Big corporation big.  Big government big.  Our little acre alone'll net hundreds a thousands.  Nothing but net.
Everybody just be cool.  Jimmy, man, I think you oughtta hear the deal.
Sorry, my brother.
You know I can't.
I'm sorry, Momma.  Maybe next time.
...I've seen things.  In there.  Last night.  You did too.  Don't tell me you didn't.  You were crying like a baby.
I lied.
Please.  It's for your own good.
If he was trying to kill you, you'd be dead.
Sure, if it was really him.  But it isn't that simple.  Jimmy's body died a long time ago.  And his soul is long gone, and all that's left is that ravening, hungry spirit in the blood that soaked into the house itself, I suppose.
Eddie Mack, that cop.  And Jeremiah.  And even when he's done, who knows.  He won't be satisfied.  Just like that demon dog. Feed it, and it just grows hungrier. Feed his hunger for revenge - he just wants more.  Who knows where it'll stop. That kind of hunger ain't never satisfied.
Careful.  That's bad luck.
Like right now, there's actually like hordes of dead people shambling around us?  Fingers rotting off?
The dead get out?
Why?  Why did you give a shit about the building?  Why did you care that we were there of all places?
I saw your face.  You knew that place. You knew those people.
Don't shit a shitter.  Our building. What did you call it?  His 'tomb'?  We had an agreement.  You were supposed to sit on it.  Not sell it --
Look, even if anyone found anything there, it's twenty years ago.  They could never connect it to us.
Nice rack.  How old is --
Not your style.  Is it Eddie?  Killing off your customers?
12-year olds.  They scare easy.  Anyway, he's gonna tip their stash.  Come with me.
That you stole off those white boys was down here last night?  Are you crazy? Everybody from hell to breakfast heard that screamin' on Blackstone last night!
We just thought...
Yeah right, and which ever of us is still alive at the end of the week inherits all Vincent Price's cash.
Maurice, even if it was true, what are you worried about?  Last time I checked, you weren't black.  I'm not sure what the hell you are.  But I know you aren't a black man.
Not really to live, just to play.
Gonna be le hot shit.  Pardon my Francais.  Dance club.  The Resurrection Brothers play there.  Heard of them?
It's not safe down there.  The fire started down there.  The whole thing could collapse.
Well, the bad news is we only made 25 bucks each.
Boy, put that thing down.  You can't take that.  Might be evidence.
Sit down, Gino!
We're family, Caesar.
Gimme the gun.
She's doing the work herself.
They were early.
It couldn't have been.
It's impossible!
You can't leave.
Where is the money?
Saved me?  You don't even know me. You used me, Caesar, just like I used you.  All part of the business.
What?
Holy shit, I don't believe it!  We've been going crazy over here, Gino!
Caesar, don't.
Not on duty, sorry.
Another time.
Where is it?
We was worried about you, Cease.
I started thinking maybe it's about the money so I call you, but all I get is the busy signal.  I figure the phone is off the hook, that's why I come rushing over here.
Actually, yeah, she was nervous about Gino coming, wanted everything to look right.  You know women, Mick.
You got the key?
Hello?
I guessed you were straight black.
Mmmm ...  thanks, I needed this.
I'm sorry, I usually would call Rajeev, but I didn't know what to do so I called Mr. Bianchinni.
I'm sorry, look, forget it.  I shouldn't have called...
Do you have a pot or a bucket?
Isn't it obvious?  I'm trying to seduce you.
He's a launderer?
How long have you been with him?
You didn't want to see me, did you?
I don't understand - ?
Because it's the truth.
What you heard wasn't sex.
No.  Shelly knows what I am.  He saw me in a bar with another woman.
Shelly was skimming from the business. He came to see me yesterday because he was afraid Caesar figured it out. He wanted to run but he wanted me to come with him.
Caesar is going to get the money and bring --
Yes.
Gino Marzzone.
What happened?
What did Gino drink?
What time did you say they would be there?
And as you do, the bottle will slip from your hands.  -- and shatter against the hardwood floor.
I'm just asking, what if?
If you're this goddamn smart, how did you ever get caught?
Hey.
How'd it go?
Hey, Caesar!  You take care of this girl, or I find out!
No, Johnnie.  No goddamned phones. Not now.
Oh, God.
Mickey?  What are you doing here?
Mickey!  Oh God, Mickey!
She's a gypsy.  If it's a cover, it's a great one.
<u>This is an operations desk</u>.
No.  We can't risk it.
We don't know what we're into!
Yes.
Treadstone.
Did you bring investment advice for me tonight?  It was tax shelters, wasn't it?  Swiss debenture-swaps.
Who do you think sent me?
<u>Was this a game or a fuck up</u>?
Well, either you are, or you aren't.
Paris?
Kane.  Do you have Mr. John Michael Kane?
We also thought we hadn't heard from you -- we've had a bit of a publicity nightmare, people have been talking.  Our offices were broken into -- vandalism mostly -- shortly after we last spoke.
So what's in Paris?
Okay.  Twenty thousand.  Ten now.  Ten there.
What if I say no?
Shit --  Can I tell you how much you're freaking me out?  Okay?  Because you are -- you're completely freaking me out.
That's what I'm saying.
Okay, so you're a victim.
I should go.
This is your office?  God, you live like a monk...
-- what're you doing? -- Jason, please, tell me what's happening!
-- let me do this, okay? --
You knew he was coming.
Oh, Jesus...
-- there's two of us -- we'll tell them -- we'll just --
You stayed there five times in the past six months.  But I didn't have time -- I could only get the bill from the last stay -- you were there for two days.  Some room service -- there's half a dozen phone calls here so that's someth--
What does that mean?  Jason, what does that mean?  Jason, please...who is he?
It doesn't matter who you were before.  It's who you want to be. That's all that matters.  We have this money.  We have what we have.  I had nothing before and now, I don't know, maybe I have more, maybe it's nothing, but...  I say we leave here.  We leave this place.  We go until we can't go anymore.
What about you?
Can I help you?
-- this is serious business down here and we cannot have people coming and going --
Wait a minute --
<u>Miss Kreutz</u>, excuse me, but you entered into a fraudulent marriage in an effort to circumvent the immigration laws of the United States --
xxxxxx...
-- and they're sure it's him? --
-- what're you talking about? --
-- you gotta give me more to go on --
You're awake.  Can you hear me?  You've been shot.  I'm trying to help you.  You were in the water.  You've been shot.  It's okay now.
...ergency procedures.
...ixed itself.
... fix themselves.
Sign the form so we can get to it.
Well not exactly. But, if you help us we'll help you. The Forces Of Darkness have won the day ... but, tomorrow is another one
Er ... Thanks ...
Oh ...  Thank you very much, mother, but actually -
Jill Layton ...  You're a very good little girl. What are you doing here?
Deputy minister, what do you believe is behind this recent increase in terrorist bombings?
Do you think that the government is winning the battle against terrorists?
If I can help you ...
Help me!
I'm not a terrorist! You must know that! I'm not guilty! Get me out of here!
Jack!!
You clever bastard! I might have guessed. You only moved in today and you're already hot on the bloody trail.
How much do you know?
Christ! You do know it all!
Sam, there are very rigid parameters laid down to avoid that event but Buttle's heart condition did not appear on Tuttle's file. Don't think I'm dismissing this business, Sam. I've lost a week's sleep over it already.
Er ... but I would've found out anyway.
And you're mine.
Take her off the list.
Come off it, Jack! Of course you can check to see if she's been arrested.
It could all be coincidental.
Jack, she's innocent!
Jack?... Jack?
You think these are tits don't you?
I bet you'd like to touch them?
... This is amazing ... for me ... being here with you. I mean, in my dreams you ...
You know, smoking's bad for you.
Yes. Ceiling. Why did you run away?
Why don't you say, no system is perfect.
Who is this war against, Sam?
Turn around!
They'll be there waiting.
Will you please turn back.
I was right! Step on it!
Come on, let's go! Let's get out of here!
We? Don't blame me!
Shit! The house is on fire!
I vas just trying to help. I decided to trust you. Maybe I was wrong. Whose side are you on really? Who are your friends? Who was the man who gave you the parcel? What's in it? It's the only thing you saved from the lorry .... It must he something very special.
Oh, good!
A cheque.
I've never seen a Ministry cheque before.
Problem. She doesn't have a bank account.
Oh God! I think I've broken a bone. What a pathetic thing I am.
Damn! Blast!
I've go to accept that promotion to get behind this, haven't I?
What?
What?  Look, let me use the console for a few minutes.
Sod it, it's broken!
I just wish you would stop interfering, mother! I don't want promotion. I'm happy where I am.
Is Mr Helpmann here?
It's a refund ... I'm afraid there was a mistake.
My husband's dead, isn't he?
My name is Sam Lowry. I have to report to Mr Warren.
I don't know which numero.
Sign here please.
What?
Well, yes ... and no. Officially, only Central Service operatives are supposed to touch this stuff ... Could you hold these.
You're killing me, you know that? You got no sick time according to Command. I've been told to terminate.
Nobody tells me to fire anyone. I told them: shove it up the big one.  Sorry.  I said, you want to fire him, come over and do it yourself.
You're late, Pierce. I know, but I can't fire you. I've got nobody to work sixteen XRay with Walls.
I got some forms here to fill out about that accident when you get the time.  I'll fire you tomorrow. I promise.
In that time, you ever have sex?
I'm always interested in people in stressful occupations and being a paramedic is about as stressful as I can imagine. Here, sit down. What's it like? Tell me some war stories.
Red Death?  Tell me something, Frank--does killing your clients make good business sense to you? The kids selling that shit have no sense. They'll be taken care of, don't worry about that.
Do you have any music?
Is there any chance?
You shouldn't smoke.
That boy you brought in, he was shot, wasn't he?
He's dead, huh?
I think this place stinks.
It's crazy in there. What's wrong with that doctor? He keeps mumbling, poking himself in the eye when he talks to me.
Sleeping.
He's better.
Not as good as Nino's.
Five years.
Mostly. It must be my face. My mother always said I looked like a priest.
Excuse me. You seemed like you were in trouble.
If I'm not back in fifteen minutes, hit the buzzer. That way she'll let me go.
I shouldn't have asked you to come.
Promise you won't go inside.
Too bad. He called me up today, can you believe that? I don't know how he got my number. He asks me do I want to come over and see him, I tell him I'd rather go to a leper colony. He says there's a new gang that wants to kill him, take over the business. I told him I hope he's right. That they kill him. That's what I told him.
No, we just ate. I only remember how tough my father was. Now I know he had to be like that, to make us tough. This city'll kill you if you aren't strong enough.
Nice though, pulling back her hood as we drive by. There's a mystery to it, then she shows you.
Don't give me that look.
You know what I'm talking about. It's all over your face. That I-just- saved-a-little-baby-boy look.
He got better.
That's good, Frank. No, but they might surgically implant one, about the size of my thumb. It goes near the shoulder here, with two electrodes connected to the heart. It sends a shock whenever it senses a drop in blood flow. Amazing, isn't it?
Last show of the night.
No.
I'm sick, Tom. I need a cure.  Vitamin B cocktail, followed by an amp of glucose and a drop of adrenaline. Not as good as beer, but all I got.
Our mission is coffee, Tom. A shot of the bull, Puerto Rican espresso.
Tom, where are the Band-aids? This is an ambulance, isn't it?
Where you going?
The brakes are shot.
Whadda we bring?
C'mon, Tom, pick up a job.
Let's get in a fight, then.
I don't know--let's break some windows.
Destruction, distraction. I feel the need.
This guy's been terrorizing the neighborhood for weeks, ever since he got outta jail, wreaking general havoc, contributing to the bad name of the place. The term "menace to society" was made up for him.
Look at that. Tell me that's a crazy person. Every move is calculated. He knows exactly what he's doing. This is the guy. I've been after him for weeks. He's quick, runs like a rat, tough for one person, but with two of us--
They'll just keep calling.
Larry, swing over on Eighth. We're gonna hafta run one of these calls.
You're in the stomach! Let me try.
Stomach again.
Shit, shit, shit...
Okay if I watch you tape that interview downstairs?
You want to go out there --  get out of this for a second?
You're feeling good, aren't you?
You were smokin' toward the end there.
Hold it down, okay?
Yes.  You're not going to stick around for the farewell party?
You know what I...
It's nice to see you.
Eventually rising to...
Now listen, Arnold just said that he's been making three million a movie now.  But he's not ever gonna change.  He's still the same person when he was making two million dollars a movie.  He feels no different.  He also bought a brand- new condo with Maria, they gonna furnish tastefully.
Where's where I asked him about being scared?  You should work on your speech.
Okay.  I feel like I'm slipping but do people who are actually slipping feel that way or is it always the really good people who are moving up who invariably think they're slipping because their standards are so high?
Wouldn't this be a great world if insecurity and desperation made us more attractive?  If needy were a turn-on?
Nine seconds.
I didn't sleep.  They're giving me less and less air time.  They don't think I'm at all anchor material.
Last time Paul was sick they gave Connie the weekend news instead of me.
Of course.
I think the pilot that shot down the Libyan in 1981 is stationed right here.  Maybe you could get him -- and maybe Tom should say that our F-14 is one of the hardest planes to fly. They're nicknamed 'Tomcats'.
I read about it -- that's how you can make sure you don't put on too much perfume...
Because this is important -- so don't just be polite.  I'd really like to look...what's the word I'm looking for?...
Did it really go well?
There were complaining phone calls because you were sweating?
I think you're the Devil.
You were quick enough to get Tom's help when...
Why not try it for a few weeks?
Let's go...
Okay.
We know each other well enough for me to care how I put something to you which could wipe you out. So I will phrase things the way I think they should be phrased.  All right?
Do it then.
Okay.  I think I'd better be alone for a while.
We came from Washington.
Just when do you start, telling people?
I'd like to take everyone out after the show.
No, I don't.  He happens to deserve the credit.  He's right here.
What did he say?
Do you know you're the second woman in network news history to produce?
Go back to 316, Bobbie.  The sound bite in the cab -- it starts, 'I don't know how I'll feel...'
Because...
What?
Yes.  How do you know?
...and the White House is hoping to keep a lid on it for a few days till they figure out what to do.
Jane -- For God's sake...  Look, it's time for you to go to sleep.
I don't know a recent Saturday I've sold more.  You didn't think I'd sell that health restaurant, did you?
It must be nice to always believe you know better.  To think you're always the smartest person in the room.
Hi.
Another thing I can't stand is ...when White House reporters bullshit with each other after a briefing and then one of them has a theory and the other quotes it in his story as "White House" sources say...
I thought you were incredible in there. I know how much I have to learn.  I'd really -- a lot -- appreciate it...if...
Nervous?
I didn't think you'd make it.
It's much too soon for you to have this kind of buzz around you.
Maybe I'll get off work.  I'd like to go.
At least kiss me when you do that.
That's not it.
He might be weird -- he can talk more freely if I go alone -- why's that so hard to understand?
Hi, again.  Sorry about...
What?
Well, I just think that' an extraordinary proposal.
I got promoted for things like that.
That's not going to be the way we say good-bye.  Even though I think what you did was rotten -- it's not all impersonal.  You mean something to me.
I don't wan to discuss work.
I knew what you meant.
So you have an extra bathing suit, huh?
Take it easy.
What a great surprise.  I didn't think we had a chance.  I heard you wanted to stay in Washington.
Well, we should talk.  You going to have time for  dinner?  I'd like you to meet Lila.
I just need you for another minute now, so we can shoot from behind towards me, and, um...
Well I'm done talking to you, what do I have to do, draw you a diagram!
Tonight.
It's kind of dark -
When's the last time you had a totally nude girl in your room...
It's just an innocent question.  Besides I just wanted to clarify your intentions.
Not really.  One girl who fit the descrip came in, kinda skinny, brunette, didn't see much changing hands.
Like it?  It's a masterpiece.  I've never seen anything like it before... and I hope I never see anything like it again. Walter smiles and looks at his creation -
Oh yeah?
More champagne, your majesty?
It's true, isn't it?
Well that was for your sculpture of the girl.  Your nude in the chair.
Would you really like to?  That would make me very happy.
Walter...there's...
Are you trying to be funny?
I've never seen anyone so... squeamish.  Well, what's your opinion, Leonard?
No.  Why don't you cover it up Walter...
Carla and I will guide you, help develop and evolve your work...maybe lead you toward something more abstract...
It's our road kill series.  I take the pictures.
Man that's a trippy name, kinda like the Warhol mayhem series...
What did he say?
Man, why do you suppose Walter wants to get her alone?  You suppose he could be physically attracted to her?
Dead Cat!
All that is comes through the eye of the artist...
People seem to like my cat.
Go home.
I thought I'm not supposed to sit with the customers...
A show..how soon can we go?
Hello Leonard!  Beautiful morning, isn't it?
Walter...Walter listen carefully.  I don't want you to make any more statues.  Do you understand? No more statues.
What offers have you got for it? I won't be out-bidded.  I'm a wealthy man and I don't mind paying for something I want.
What do you want for it?  Two thousand? Three thousand?
Hello, Walter.
Did you see my cat?
You like chasing the dragon, Walter?
Haven't you ever heard of smack! Horse!  Junk!  Heroin!
Wait a minute - I told you I didn't do nothing wrong!
I thought you believed that life is a homeless traveler riding on the RTD of -
Maxwell.
Hello Mayolia.
Uh, no, I didn't see him at all.
Uh, Mrs. Swicker I got to meet some friends later, and I have to take a shower!
I look horrible.
I don't know.  But the boy, he couldn't kill them.
Well, um... litter?
Nice to feel needed.
Come on, come on, fork up the scub.
Figures.
You're the guys from the movie!
Benny, man, where you been?  You bailed on me, I passed out, man, I almost did a Jimi Hendrix!
Are there any good sicknesses that aren't too depressing?
Hi, Buffy.
Have you gained a few pounds?  Maybe it's that outfit...
You okay?
Oh.  Who's in it?  I know what it is.  It's what's on instead of the movie.
Hey, baby, how ya doing?  You look beat.
I don't understand.
I am a God!  A God!
Yeah, we're drunk.  We're the Drunks. What's your name?
Well, stay here tonight.
Where are you gonna go?
I'm kinda beat.  You can stay in my mom's room if you want.
You sure?
Why'd you come back?
Pike, I don't think you're up to this.
Who?
Cool.  I could actually use a couple of Allen wrenches.  What do you need?
Come again?
He did what he was supposed to.
Leave me alone.
It has to be, like a socially conscious theme.
What are we doing?
Let's meet tonight, okay?
I had a trust fund my great- grandfather, or maybe it was an inheritance, 'cause he's dead, and I spent it on shoes.
Chosen to go to the graveyard?  Why don't you just take the first runner up, okay?
I don't know.  It was...  There was a big gram or something.  And there's one, I'm like a prostitute...
It's not pretty, but it does suit our purposes.
Well... I do cheerleading now. It's way cooler.
No -- you don't have to --
No.  You don't do anything.  I do it.
Oh, what the hell is wrong with you?  You threw a knife at my head!
But you threw a knife at my head!
Put your head back.
If I say 'no' does that make me a bad person?
Same one.
He was slow.  Very simple.  They won't all be that easy.
Oh, wonderful.  My secret weapon is - PMS.  That's just great.  Thanks for telling me.
Five?
Watchers?
I wish you would.
I'm curious, is all.
Well, you know, I'm not gonna kick so easy.  I've got a few things the other girls didn't have.
We call them zippers.  They're not supposed to be a challenge.
There isn't time.
All right.
Mr. Howard is so heinous.  He's always giving me a hard time.  I get a C-plus on the test and he tells me, 'You have no sense of history.'  I have no sense of history?  He wears a brown tie.
Buffy, Jesus!  You know these steps.
Well, I guess you got what you came for.
What... are you?
No, wait.  I can be dumb.  Really. Or mean, or whatever.  I can learn. I'm useful.
Why?  Why me?
You think so?
Listen, you little worm.  I could beat your head to a pulp for you, just like I did last year, you got that?  You got that?
Well, I'm done.  Are you done?
I can't believe they still ate it.
And Spring Fling.
Buffy, the ape-woman.
What are you talking about?
Oh, thank you very much.
No...  You want me to give him a message?
All right.  Take care of yourself.
You said "Crash".
You're patronizing me!  I will not be patronized--
How ya like that?
I think you're real cute.
Nuke!  You got things all wrong! There's no relation between sex and baseball.  Ask Crash.
He did?
I gotta leave first thing in the morning.
Ebby Calvin Nuke LaLoosh--don't think too much.
--Millie, you've got to stay out of the clubhouse.  It'll just get everybody in trouble.
You didn't get "lured".  Women never get lured.  They're too strong and powerful for that. Now say it--"I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions".
I'm committed to Nuke for the season.  You had your chance the other night.
Damn.
247 home runs in the minors would be a dubious honor, if ya think about it.
Damn.
You're gorgeous, God damn it! From the moment I first saw you I knew I had to have you.  I had to have you!
I don't know if I'd go that far.
I got released.
...  so you see in a former lifetime I'm sure that I was Alexandria, the Czarette of Russia? What do you think?
What happened?
I'm quitting too.  Boys, not baseball.
Take this to Ebby in the dugout between innings.
Oh no--he's shaking off the sign, Jackson.  Big mistake...
Let's have a quick word of prayer, right here, to thank the Lord for all this--
No, no, honey...  first the shoes and socks.
No, that is not belief.  That is desperation.
I got him on the knee!
You missed the tag!
You're close, Crash, you want me to run you?  I'll run you!
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
Hey!  What're you guys doing here-- stealing my girl?
"Naw"?  There's ice skaters coming! You ever made love to an ice skater?
Party without me.
I was playing naked.
Of course.  That's the point.  "I'm just happy to be here and hope I can help the ballclub."
She's getting steamed 'cause I'm still re-channeling my sexual energy--maybe I should cave in and sleep with her once just to calm her down.  What'ya think?
What's wrong?
Anybody says anything bad about Millie, I'll break his neck.
I have been known, on occasion, to howl at the moon.  D'you understand that?
You will.  Look, Nuke--these Big League hitters are gonna light you up like a pin ball machine for awhile-- don't worry about it.  Be cocky and arrogant even when you're getting beat.  That's the secret.  You gotta play this game with fear and arrogance.
No.  Fear and arrogance, you, hayseed, not ignorance!
Well, I got Annie all warmed up for ya...  She's just waiting for you to show up, y'know...
Crash Davis?
I'm too old for this shit.  Why the hell am I back in "A" ball?
We want you to room with him on the road and stay on his case all year.  He can go all the way.
I don't know.  I haven't caught anything yet.
She's playing with my mind.
Hi, Jimmy.  Want a ride?
He's got a million dollar arm and a five cent head.
But he ain't quite sure which plane he's on, y'know what I mean...
Patkin was a tribute to baseball...
Jesus--what's got into Nuke?
What'you want, kid?
It turned out Phil Green, Mr Integrity, had a partner nobody knew about... and when she showed up and started demanding some money from the Tangiers...
I'm a little in shock, quite frankly...
You were in the m- You were in the building.
He's on all night, screamin' about how he's gonna take his damn lawsuit all the way to the Supreme Court. He really must be crazy. He's gonna go to Washington with this?  He's out of his fuckin' mind.
First of all, what they did was totally unconstitutional. We're already on the list to be heard before the Supreme Court of the United States later this year.
...been right, but who knows?
Fine, fine. How's your family?
Look, look. You can't stop her for speeding? I mean, look what the hell she's doing.
Yeah.
Now this is just a signature card.
Sam, let me ask you a question. You must really trust your wife.
Amy! Amy, open the door!
It was eight.  Ace... tell him the line on the Bear's game.
But nobody had to take care of Nicky.
...nobody interfered with the fuckin' skim.
But I saw it another. I saw it as untouched. I mean, they had bookies, pimps and drug dealers I could shake down. Who the fuck were they gonna run to?  So, I started getting everybody in line. Best of all, for the first time in my life, I figured out a way not to lose.
When I married Ginger I knew all the stories, but I didn't give a fuck. 'I'm Sam Rothstein,' I said. 'I can change her.'
...the next thing I did, I started bustin' out high-stakes poker players.
And I didn't want any of those agents near my place.
I mean, Nicky's a made guy and I'm not. I can't do that.
No, I didn't know that. But you know what he did?
He insulted Billy. And then I walked over to him politely...
So what do you think I do? I threw that cocksucker out.
You better watch yourself. There's a lot of heat on you already.
Bullshit or no bullshit, they put you in that book, you're gonna be in a lot of trouble. You will not be able to walk into the casino. I'm tellin' you.
I'm just tellin' you. Don't say I didn't warn you.
' ...detrimental to gaming. And he will be ejected from any casino in Las Vegas...  and the casinos can be fined as much as a hundred thousand every time he shows up.'  Do you believe this shit?
In other words, I'm fucked.
- no matter where he was or what he was doing, he always went home to make breakfast for his son, Nicky- Boy.
You think he got the point?
...okay? I just wanna run a square joint. That's it. I just want my license. I want everything nice and quiet. That's it.
Looks bad? I'm gonna tell you what looks bad.
All right.
Yeah.
My wife?
That's right, yeah.
Nicky was questioned in two dozen murders, but they always had to let him go. There were never any witnesses.
Oh, I don't know whether you know this or not, but you only have your fuckin' casino because I made that possible!
Nicky, Nicky, you're not listenin' to me. I'm here to help you. What's the matter with you?  You're gonna bury us both.
I think if you, uh, okay it, you know, assure her that she's gonna be all right, she'll come back.
Hello.
Yeah, what are you doin'? You okay?
She's there with you?  She's there with you?
Hey, house is doin' well.  Hey, all that money is rollin' in. I appreciate you takin' the time to see a poor ol' civil servant.
Well, could there be any position... further down the trough?
Let's go to lunch. Do you want to go to the Riviera?
Legally, she can't take that stuff. Legally, she can't take the stuff.
I hired an old casino pal, Billy Sherbert, as my manager and I went to work.
Fuckin' asshole won't budge.
This woman's an institution.
To Abraham Lincoln.
Now, he's really pissed.
He wants a fifty-thousand marker.
Yeah, Billy Sherbert, please. Put him on.
I'll be right back.
She took care of the dealers...
You all right?
So, do you think it's too much if I wear these in the same day?
Come on. Can I keep this one in the house?
Why do you need that much?
You didn't have to beat him up!
Right.
It's under...
Okay, no big deal. That's okay. Yeah. He got his twenty-five.  That I'll live with. Any more I couldn't.
Yeah.
Yes, I want to kill you! I hate your fuckin' guts!
Take your  fuckin' bag and get out of here!
And I still get my money. I need some cash right now. You can't just put me in the street.
You're lower than a dog!
Yeah, no kidding. Good! It opens at 9 a.m. Be there!
I am. I'm wakin' her up right now.
You threw it away?
I was with somebody.
Oh...
It's just for a little while, Sam. The baby-sitter wasn't there.
She wasn't gonna get up. I was just gonna be out for a little while.
I wouldn't -
She, she's alone. Just go. Take the gun and go into Amy's.
Don't you threaten me!
I'm afraid to let her in the house.
Should I let her in like - ?
...'Ace' Rothstein, accused the state's top gaming officials of corruption.
...and hypocrisy.
No, no, no, no, please, please, please, please, no, please.
I do understand that. I'll get right on it. And thank you.
Yes, there is. An infallible way! They won!
No, Sir.
I just wanna get out of here.
Fuckin' kids at home!  Here.  Get the fuck out of here.
Hey... you got a minute? Hey. He's got two million in the box, am I right?  Okay, you let him keep your jewels. We take the cash and the only other thing he cares about.  Huh?  Her majesty. We go to Europe. You dye your hair, get some pl-
You gotta go back there and talk to that guy.
What expenses?
Artie, no records, Artie. What are you gonna do with records? Pay taxes?
Yeah, that works out.
You need to understand, and I - I'm sure you do... that in a venture of this kind, you have to be prepared to take some kind of loss.
I've been trying to reach you. You're tougher to get than the President.
Hey, you fat Irish prick. You put my fuckin' money to sleep. You go get my money, or I'll put your fuckin' brain to sleep.
Mrs Ro- Mrs Rothstein! Okay, shh!
I'm just trying to get in my house!
And here. Here.
No, you can, you can.  You've been so nice to me.
You know who you're fuckin' with?! Huh? Do you?!
...in some legitimate places, like my restaurant.
He's comin' over.
Carmine left?
Carmine? He was here before. I saw him. He had a suitcase and everything, and then he left.
Artie! Artie!
We're - we're placing you under arrest for -
...I want all the names of all the other people he had with him. And I don't care what you have to do to him to get 'em. You understand?
Yeah. Everybody's talkin' about it. They're makin' a big deal out of it.
I always tell you the truth, Remo.
Yeah, I know. That's why I'm asking. You see, my main concern is Nicky.
Ace.
Uh-huh. Good.
Well, you gotta understand it. He doesn't know if this guy is shaking you down or taking advantage of you.
I can see that. Sure.
No. I - I'm just curious, you know. I was wonderin' how much he would put into a thing like that. That's all.
Well, there you go. But what does that tell ya? A million dollars in jewelry. Does that tell you the guy is crazy about you, or what?
Okay.
Thanks.
Thank you.
I mean, listen, two people don't get along, at some point you gotta call it... I mean, it's none of my business, but I ... I think that's what you gotta do. You gotta take it somewhere -
What? What?
You know?
Yes, you did.
He hates my fuckin' guts.
Yeah.
Hey, don't be such a fuckin' smartass, will you?  I mean, I know the fuckin' guy thirty-five years, I'm gonna fuckin' whack him for you?  Fuck... motherfucker! I knew this, I knew it.
Ah, you fuck! You're such a fuckin' asshole!
Get the fuck out of here.
So, what'd you say to that fuckin' jerk anyway?
Yes!
What money?  Look at this stack of chips. Don't give me that shit. I want my end.
Yes.
I'm here.
- with stupid braces on your teeth.
Ginger... It means he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, waiting for me to call him back. Now, I -
He's sittin' by the phone -
Go! Go! Get in the car! Go!
They checked in alone.
Excuse me, but I folded these things beautifully and I would appreciate a little respect. Jesus Christ!
Look, there aren't...  There aren't but...
Wow.
'Cause it clogs up your heart.
Ace saw Vegas one way.
Give all the guys in your crew a piece of that?
This is Nick.
Yeah, thanks a lot.
...bosses. I mean, they're smokin' their Di Nobilis and they're eatin' a trippa [Italian-American slang for 'tripe'.] and fuckin' suffritt', you know, fried pigs guts? While, if I wanna talk private, I gotta go to a fuckin' bus stop.
Yeah, but they're complaining.
You must have drunk too much.
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
I told him I didn't know nothin'. But Jiggs and, uh, Tony Gorilla said if you did anything, you're fucked up.
Nah. You would've heard somethin'.
And you make it disappear, you know what I mean?
You're gonna fuckin' kill her. Take it easy.
I fucked up, Frankie. I fucked up good this time. Should have never started with this fuckin' broad.
Listen to me, Anthony. I got your head in a fuckin' vise. I'm gonna squash your fuckin' head like a grapefruit if you don't give me a name. Don't make me have to do this, please. Come on. Don't make me be a bad guy. Come on.
Charlie M? You make me pop your fuckin' eye out of your head to protect that piece of shit? Charlie M? You dumb motherfucker!
Do I hear a motion seconded?
Again!
...done right, you gotta do it yourself.
Hey, Hot Stuff. You're still on the clock...

You know, nobody likes you...
What's the matter...
I'll bet the butler's name wasn't "Jeff."
Oh, it's superb--I mean if you like that fascist nightmare kind of thing...
Selina Kyle...lovely person.
I better go report this in...
Selina, are you okay?
You're kidding.
Don't you feel so much better now that you know everything?  Blink once for yes, twice for..
What do you want from me?
The "skylight?" Fool!  It's too high for anybody to climb out the damn skylight...
Yeah, this is better than rape.
What a "drag."
Right time. That was kind of fun. She had spunk.
God-damn..
Well, you don't see that everyday. Somebody tell me what's the deal with Frida Kahlo here?
A superhero's job is to protect society.  Don't blame me if society is a horrible, corrupt joke.
My, those little ears pick up a lot. The Cult of Good will die heroically preventing a world-class heist. Since we will be the ones performing the heist, our deaths will obviously be fake. But have no fear. There will be many other deaths tomorrow...and those will be quite real. I'm afraid these questions of yours put you in a position not unlike a long-tailed tabby in room full of rocking chairs.
Hey, you're anti-male.
What if I were to say "You're Fired?"
Yeah, she's okay.
Hey, Captain God!
Did you try to kill...
Hey, architect--she's joking. Right, Selina?  Selina?
Maybe.
Don't sneak up on me...
I never thanked you..the arrow..the motorcycle..the computer disc..You're so different from what I..and so the same.
What's it like being a superhero?  It must be frightfully exciting..How did you guys all get together?
You seem sad, Spooky.
Nice breasts.
I know.  But it's an emergency. Somebody dying.  Okay?
Was someone in an accident?
Be careful.  There were people in that crosswalk.
Who's on the phone?
I know you feel awful but it's not your responsibility.
Are you guys all right?
Lady, don't let him do it!
In case you crapped out it was my job to go after that briefcase.
You missed.
You never miss a trick.
If you know that just back off.
Nels, don't let that cop pass you.
Do I know you?
No.  <u>You</u> don't understand!  You caught me on my cellular on the way to pick up some business associates.  And I've got no time to screw around.
Don't expect me to tell you who I am.
Oh won't I?
Fine, no tunnel.  Are you still with me?  Hello?
Stop throwing names at me.
Tell me what she looks like.
Where's the fucking recharger cord?  Must be in her car, dammit.
I sure as hell got my wish.  She doesn't exist.  So maybe you reached the appropriate person after all.
Don't say anything.  Don't alarm them.  Just go!
I should've put them out of the car and come sooner!
What bank?
I'm not doing too well.  What's the matter?
What's going on?
Did you hear that click?
They wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles.
He's in back.  Lying face down. They haven't hurt him anymore -- but he was crying.  I never heard Jack cry before --
Once you're in the car with me she's sure to come to us.
Damned if I know.
At least one.
And all that crap about your driver being murdered by a cop --
Sit completely still with both hands on the wheel -- until they get here.
Yes I would.  Not kill you.  But blow off a few toes, absolutely. I'm entitled to that as retribution.  It'll help you to remember me in years to come -- every time you put on stockings. They must have prosthetic toes by now -- with little nails on them you can polish --
He wants 75 back.
It could be a fire.  This is Malibu.
What's Nels' number?
They'll have units blocking us up ahead.
What's happening?
You've had a lot of fun with me today.  What would you have done if I hadn't responded to your call?
Both hands on your lap.
Exactly who was this Oberfeld?
Five ... six.
Where do we meet?
I want you all in one vehicle. Your van.  If I see anybody else cruising around I'll keep going. No second chances.  You can kill them and I'll keep what I've got.
She's somewhat damaged in the shipping.  But nothing makeup won't cover.
308-9962.
I don't want you within two hundred feet.  Park down by the lifeguard station.  Nobody gets out.
It's in the process.
Seems like it.
If he pulls me over he gets all the proceeds plus Lenore here.
That bitch.  What's keeping you from taking off?
We're gonna get there first.
Probably as close to the Getty as I'll ever come.  Unless you care to be my "patron," Nels.  You wouldn't be the first successful thief to become a patron of the arts.
Don't underestimate me.  I've got original ideas of my own.  Warhol got famous doing a soup can.  What would you think of a cellular phone done in acrylics?
Let me talk to the lady again.
The 405 is coming up.
You sure know how to take a lot of punishment.
He's what she should run a mile from.
She wants me to tell you go fuck yourself.
He agreed that he was.
Good thing in a man.
Hey, Stirling fucking Moss --
Take your clothes.
What's that supposed to mean?
Sorry won't bring the bloody thing back, will it, Mr. Franknum?
You old-fashioned?
What was that?
Perform?
You on the game?
Jesus Christ!
That Dave?
What'll it be?
Sorry. How'd he drive with his neck in a brace?
Do you miss him?
I think you do.
Shouldn't you be in mourning?
Did he come here too?
Did he ever tell you you were beautiful?
Even now.
I didn't mean to hit you.
Will you meet me again?
I should have known, shouldn't I?
Won't be quite the same though, will it?
Should have stayed a girl.
Come on.
What's wrong, Jimmy? Tell me what's wrong --
You'd like me better that way, Jimmy?
So it's true, then?
Why?
What pills?
What?
Dil Can I tell you something? I knew your man.
You didn't.
You tried.
Don't leave me tonight. Might kill me, too.
Why?
Love me.
And you'll never leave me?
Yes.
I've got to keep you healthy, Jimmy. I'm counting the days. Two thousand three hundred and thirty-four left.
You'll notice I've asked you nothing.
You don't know that.
Maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth. No thanks to you.... What you think of the hair?
But, then, I don't have a choice.
You were made for this.
Who's the old geezer?
Why would you do that?
What?
Hope not.
I seen your fucking face.
What's that?
You're going to have to do it, aren't you?
What the fuck am I doing here.
Can't.
Now, that was worth waiting for.
Thank you. I had a case of the clap two years ago. Crabs in Ulster. But all in all it's served me well.
Fergus?
Having two pints in the Rock.
The best.
Depends on what you believe in.
Is it bad?
She can't help it.
I thought as a child. But when I became a man I put away childish things...
Cause you're my friend. And I want you to go to the Metro --
So if I ran now, there's no way I'd beat you, is there?
What?
Don't run off, Jude.
What if I did?
Never pissed holding a girl's hand, Jude.
It was fun while it lasted.
Have you no feelings, woman?
Give me the shooter, Jude --
Don't you dare to be civil with me! All this time you were leading me on --
No -- I guess not.
Oh, you should see your face.
What's the matter?
I thought maybe you wanted me to see the kind of work the competition was turning out.
Oh? Did they do that sort of thing way back in your day?
If the police find him first they're not very likely to turn over a quarter of a million dollars to us, are they?
I think we were wrong about Tex having the money.
Heroin -- peppermint-flavored heroin.
as outlined in report number three- nine-stroke-five-two of the Western Hemisphere Conference held on March 22 --  no wait! It was last Thursday, five o'clock at the Jardin des Champs- Élysées! Adam -- that was it! The garden!
But I didn't kill anybody.
Never mind -- I'll go by myself.
Dry-cleaningwise, things are all fouled up. I had a good man -- an excellent man on the Rue Ponthieu, but H.Q. asked us to use the plant here in the building -- to ease the gold outflow.
Mrs. Lampert, I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger.
I believe you.
We've no proof, of course, but we rather think so, yes.
I don't know who this Mr. Dyle is, but it's just possible we were wrong about who killed your husband.
Where are you now -- can you meet me? Do you know Les Halles?
Yes, but I lost him. I really did it quite brilliantly. I'm beginning to think women make the best spies.
He has a gun, Mr. Bartholomew -- I saw it.
Café.
Go on, please -- five men -- $250,000 -- the French Underground --
We know what happened from the bits and pieces we were able to paste together -- but we still have no proof.
That's the spirit.
No, Mrs. Lampert.
No.
If you do anything funny, or try to talk to anyone, I'll kill you, Dyle -- here and now. Okay?
Sorry about that.
Very pretty. Now what?
Is that why you dragged me all the way up here -- to ask me that? She has it -- you know that.
And stop threatening that boy. He doesn't have the money. Mrs. Lampert doesn't either.
That's a crock! If one of us did that he wouldn't hang around here waiting for the other two to wise up.
It's the only name I've got. How about you?
Your passport! What kind of a proof is that?
You can't.
I hope it turns out you're a Whitefoot, Alex -- I could be very happy hanging around the tepee.
Oh-oh -- here it comes. The fatherly talk. You forget I'm already a widow.
What are you doing?
But I'm not through complaining yet.
What day is it?
Come on -- let's get busy. Who gets your vote?
Hm?
Yes, I know.
Hurry up and change -- I'm starved.
Then I suggest you call one of them.
What do I have to do to satisfy you -- become the next victim?
Okay. Then get set for the story of my life -- not that it would ever make the best-seller list.
Well, I can't really blame you -- not now.
Sorry, the name's Adam Canfield.
Yes.
The money is unimportant.
What for? If it's not here, why bother him?
It doesn't belong to you, Mrs. Lampert -- you do know that, don't you?
Dead, Mrs. Lampert -- like last week's news -- like Charles, Mrs. Lampert --
Oh. Swiss. His profession?
"My dear Regina: I hope you are enjoying your holiday. Megeve can be so lovely this time of year. The days pass very slowly and I hope to see you soon. As always, Charles. P.S. Your dentist called yesterday. Your appointment has been changed."  Not very much, is it?
Swell -- only this man doesn't have a garden.
Voilà what?
I hope I don't find any little hairy things living up here -- wait! There is something! If I can just -- yes, I'm getting it -- a case of some sort -- it's heavy.
Up there! It is up there!
He was throwing snowballs at Baron Rothschild.  We don't know each other, do we?
Oh. I guess.
No, I'm not -- I've got some packing to do. I'm also going back to Paris today.
Hallo, Peter.
Who said?
How would you like a punch in the nose? Stop treating me like a child.
Peter -- are you all right?
What?
I'm so hungry I could faint.  I've -- I've gotten your suit all wet.
Yes -- that's right.
What'd he say?
Miz Lampert, ma'am...
He's the only husband I've got. I tried to make it work, I really have -- but --
But why do you want a divorce?
He knows everything.
Have you no idea who could have done it?
He must have known Charles pretty well.
Sylvie -- ? What are you doing here?
What's he up to?
Shoot no, not after all these years.
If I'm so all-used-up Ben, why do you try to hook me up non-stop?
ARE YOU THE KILLER BEN?
Why'd you send for Lenny Marliston?
If I'd gone public with this yesterday Annette Michaels might be alive today.
I'm going to tell them everything I know. I'm calling a town meeting for eight p.m.
Your curfew is 9:30 and you know it, little miss.
Hi honey.
Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses.
A little.
Daddy! I DON'T THINK THIS IS ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS!
Who is she Daddy?
No!
Should we close down any eruption?
What happened?
What are you doing?
She's not here.
She was murdered?
I knew Lisa Sherman long ago. It's extremely important that I get inside and try to verify that it's the same woman who lived here.
I know where you're going.
Please get out of my way or I'll have to hurt you.
Ok. Should I put my bike in the back of your car?
You aren't going to the party?
Me? Why me?
What do you know about my father?
Yes.
You're the killed.
The seat behind him is open. Come on, I can eavesdrop too.
No! That's his table.
What am I supposed to say? 'Nice sweater Mark'? 'Did you buy it at Eddie Bauer's?'
Hurricane Hormone. it's flattened the whole school. Guess what?
Unless he makes a move during seventh period.
I kind of like the idea that we can all lose it together, on the same night. It'll be a lot less scary. You have to go.
I was worried about you. Did you hear about the bash?
Everyone's grounded. There's a killer on the loose.
Yes you are. You always do. It's why we broke up. You always hide behind him.
They're not picking me up until six.
But if he'd been sent to jail, there would be no Jody.
And when I finally agree to spread my legs, you accuse me of treating you like meat.
Please don't go. Please. Stay, We'll just talk. Then go to the party.
I'm scared. Three kids are dead. I want to go to this party.
Hi mom.
Where are you going?
They were proving to her they weren't. They were very drunk. Things were different back then. You think kids are sexually bottled up today....
EVERYONE JUST KIND OF LOOKED THE OTHER WAY.
I don't know. We just did. I guess I was kind of scared going against the gain. Against the whole town.
Who?
Mr. Sisler was one of them.
Kenny's aunt?
You ok?
You got a great mom. I'm lucky to get a zucchini stick.
You can have both if you want.
Now don't be nervous.
At least somebody likes this shit.
Oh...
A little early for a delivery.
Great.
That's my business.
Well, he told me to collect cash.
...and fair...
Sorry, man.  He's dead.
What did I say?
No, no, no.  You don't need my truck. You need somebody else's truck...
Look, if I don't get this stuff to McGruder, it's goodbye, Andy's Ice Cream, goodbye, Jerome, goodbye, Mon-...
Wait, wait.  You don't believe the dead guy, do...
Look...I got two tons of the world's nastiest ice cream sittin' in a truck that should've been retired ten years ago.  That shit will be worthless by noon.
All right.
All right, then how about this?
There we go.  There we go.  Did you keep it safe?  Did you
You gave him ice cream, didn't you?  Come on, let's go.
That dog ain't mean.
Come on, get in the truck.
Damn diesel injections are flood-...
...-ed.

No cell.
You stole this truck!
We can't push old Pete in this heat.  He can't take it.

Oh, shit.
Get him to stand up, Night Shift.
Nice job back there.
...waiting!
Holy shit...
...Shift.

Come on, old Pete.
...-hood of you knowin' any prayers is slim...
Come on...
Whoo!



Go on.

All right.
...you're dealin' with!
Yeah, he's a dangerous...
You're--?  What?!
Come on!
Keep still.
Hey, I told you I did not steal that truck.  Andy owes me a lot more than that four-wheeled...
...just ready to just slide him right in there.  And what about me, huh?  What about Arlo, huh?  What about my needs? You know, I got a-I got student loans...
Whoo!
Yeah.

Put your hand in my pants.
Arlo!  Arlo.

Oh.
Okay, here we go.
Stop.
Here...
Okay...
...tunnel!
Mason.

...-ta get outta here!
Sorry.
You know, we saved half a million people from a full-body peel.
We're the shit.  Bigtime.
Yeah.
...face" crap you've been telling me?
...us.
Oh!
We're worried...
I urge you to be persuasive.

But...
Vaughn.
It's, uh, parked just off of Highway Thirty-Five.
Why don't you get that tub of shit Sam to...
Yeah, that's my truck.
...to Fort McGruder in his truck.
Listen, deputy.
All right, gentlemen. We're about done here.  Fine job.
...to take any extreme measures I deem necessary...
What the hell is all this about a detonation today?  We're scheduled...
And I changed the schedule.
If it works, your stock at the Pentagon will go up along with mine.  I don't think I need to mention you could use the help.
"I am become Death, the...

No, go--
...-ple.
...me?  Well, you could've saved yourself the trip.
...years of thinking the matter over, I began to see that the whole thing wasn't really my problem.

Good to see you again, Leo.
As soon as I heard Elvis was on the loose, you came to mind.
Hm.  The wind's northwest.  That oughta be...Seattle.
Besides, how are we gonna sell something we don't have?

All right.  Tell the pilot we'll be a half-hour.
Carl!  Set up the camera.

Vaughn.
Dennis!
What about these two?
This river ends at a hydro dam...
Carl, Dennis, get out of sight.
Uh, with all due respect, sir, Dr. Long told me to prep the field for detonation at...
...gear?
We gotta get help.  Aw, fuck!  Damn.
Is this your establishment?
....-lene.
Doc...
Yeah?
...your concern nor your fight.  Relinquish the package and you can go.
...-tainer!
...and unharmed, de-...

...-son.  Of all the days for you to show up late.  First, the idiot April calls in sick.  Then I got a bad tooth...
...it.
Uh, we both like to fish.
Ah.

Geneva just pulled the plug.
Gomez, you fight the battles you can win.  Now, we've been outmaneuvered here.  Brynner's next move is gonna be to get Elvis out of the country and sell him to the highest bidder.  To do that, he has to have planned an exit point.  That's where we intercept him.  That's where we make our play.  Now you and your men back off.
Deputy Art Lewis, Jerome County Sheriff's Department.
I don't suppose you'd like to tell me what this is all about.
...but you pull twice as many fish out of the water as I do.
...is a perfect hunter.
...back...
What?  Say again, Ma-...
What we gave Brynner on the dam was a phony!
Where are you now...
Mason, what is the temperature of Elvis?!
Mason.  Mason!
...public drunkenness....
...beer.
...on the other end of this phone.
Don't move!

Arlo.
It's too late, Mason. I've...
...gotta seal it.
Negative.  Negative.
Now!  Seal that tunnel now!
Always?
We worked in Chinatown together.
Very.
Why is that funny?
I've still got a few teeth in my head, Mr. Gittes, and a few friends in town.
Is she all right?
Where is she?
I'd like you to look at something, Mr. Cross.
And that's what you were going to do in the Valley?
How do you do that?
She's just no good.
You're absolutely right, I wouldn't give her another thought.
Thanks, Curly. Call me Jake.
They don't kill a guy for that.
...No...
Gee, this is a surprise, Mr. Gittes.
Sure thing.
That's just lovely.
Where did you get this material?
How do they do that?
Hello, Jake.
Looking for someone.
No. It was an accident.
You were following him night and day. You saw who killed him. You even took pictures of it. It was Evelyn Mulwray. She's been paying you off like a slot machine ever since her husband died.
Absolutely.
Yeah, I once knew a whore who for enough money would piss in a customer's face, but she'd never shit on his chest. That's where she drew the line.
No, Gittes, you'll show us.
That's it?
I'm sorry, Mrs. Mulwray.
Who is he, get his name? I'll kill him.
It looks like he was washed the entire length of the runoff channel. Could he swim?
Iced tea.
That's not his apartment.
I'm just trying to make a living, and I don't want to become a local Joke.
Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, I just --
I got your check in the mall.
Stop it. The money's fine. It's generous but you've shortchanged me on the story.
You'll have to explain that, Mrs. Mulwray.
Mr. Gittes.
Is there anything else you want to know?
For very long?
K... Cross.
Yes... why?
Another satisfied client?
Never forgave him for what?
You sure shout that?
You're looking at the owners of a 50,000 acre empire.
What do you mean, 'why?' Nobody's here, that's all.
It was in Chinatown.
Working for the District Attorney.
Hold still. Why?
What's wrong?
Oh that... It's a flaw in the iris...
The Albacore Club.
Do? To who?
Okay, give me the keys.
You know what I mean. You're keeping her there against her will.
Yes.
Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody about this.
Going somewhere?
I said I want the truth.
Yeah... where are you taking her now?
Sophie.
Sophie.
Listen, we can't string this broad out indefinitely we got to come up with something.
Sophie... is Walsh there?... yeah, listen, pal, Escobar's going to try and book me in about five minutes... relax, I'll tell you. Wait in the office for two hours. If you don't hear from me, you and Duffy meet me at 1712 Alameda.
Shut the fuck up!  ...Yes I remember nothing, Miss Sessions, just going over a detail or two with my associates... you were saying?
I understand... if you could tell me who employed you, Miss Sessions. That could help us both.
Yeah, Sophie.
Oh my goodness.
After all, you work with a man for a certain length of time, you come to know him, his habits, his values, and so forth. Well either he's the kind who chases after women or he isn't.
You ought to be more careful. That must really smart.
I said, the northwest valley.
Mr. Gittes?
Do you know me?
The water.
That's a long fall.
Yeah.
Come again?
No, really?
Lot of turnover these days. Better tell them to get in touch with me if they want to hang onto their land.
Gee whiz.  And I'm late.
Mulwray? I thought you said Cross owned the department.
This?
Apple core?
What's that, pal?
Neither do I.
Not exactly.
That right?... She used to be some looker.
That's for sure.
She ran off to Mexico. Rumor was she was knocked up and didn't even know who the father was. Went there to get rid of it.
'Cause sometimes you can't find the right place any more and so...well, actually...they stay here.  Besides, there are more kisses than you can count.
Signora Maria, don't do that. He's just a kid.  And why are you telling fibs?  We let him in free. He must have lost the money inside the movie theatre...  How much did you have?
Alfredo, did you know my father?
Any room for me in this Cinema Paradiso?
Listen to this one...The commander says to the sergeant: 'You remember that windmill that used to be there?' 'Yes, sir, I remember the mill's gone but the wind's still there!'  You remember the story of the soldier and the princess?
Good morning, father. It's hard on the feet, huh?
No particular reason...  Nice day, huh?
But...who...
Elena!...But when...
He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He has other plans for me.
My husband...you know him.
I've been looking for you all day. Did you buy the milk?
Daddy's not coming back...He's dead.
See how pretty the house is? We did everything over.  If it hadn't been for you!  Come, I have a surprise....  You must be tired. If you want to rest, there's time before the funeral.
That's fine, Mr. Kane.
"Her singing, happily, is no concern of this department.  Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to..."
It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein.  I'm dictating it.
Ask them to sit down, Mr. Bernstein.
So then, tonight, we go over everything thoroughly, eh?  Especially the new papers -
I do.  I do.  I mean, since you're running for Governor - and you want to be elected -  I think it's wonderful you're going to be elected.  Only -  -  Can I say something?
I might make him nervous.
Oh, yes, it's already made up.  Our Mr. Mervin wrote a small review.
Thatcher!  That man was the biggest darn fool I ever met -
Sixty-two thousand -
Do you, Mr. Leland?
Hello, Mr. Leland.
Where is it - where's my notice? I've got to finish it!
I suppose he's fixing it up - I know I'd never get that through.
That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on, Mr. Carter.  Right now, I wish you'd send your best man up to see Mr. Silverstone.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife at once, the "Enquirer" will have him arrested.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from the Central Office. If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his badge, your man is to get indignant and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist. Loudly, so that the neighbors can hear.
But there's another one still to come - the dramatic notice.
We haven't heard from him.
The nurse has complete instructions, but if you care to talk to me at any time, I should be only too glad -  I shall be here in the morning.
Not at all.  I'd like the nurse to be here, too.
I'm sorry I sent for you, Brad - I didn't -
There's a call I want you to make with me, Charles.
What's this all about, Emily?  I've had a very tiring day and -
I suppose so, but - I'm not afraid of the story.  You can't tell me that the voters of this state -
Oh yes, there is.
Charles, if you don't listen to reason, it may be too late -
Get out, both of you!
Toothache.
You've got some on your face.
Where's the soap?
Where's the towel?
Excuse me, Mr. Kane.  I know this takes a lot of nerve, but - who are you?  I mean - I'm pretty ignorant, I guess you caught on to that -
I didn't run into you and I bet they're not your Sunday clothes. You've probably got a lot of clothes.
Yes -
Don't tell me your toothache is bothering you again?
I mean in New York.
Oh, I don't mean the things you've given me - that don't mean anything to you.  What's the difference between giving me a bracelet or giving somebody else a hundred thousand dollars for a statue you're going to keep crated up and never look at?  It's only money.  It doesn't mean anything. You're not really giving anything that belongs to you, that you care about.
Goodbye, Charlie.
Let's not start all over again, Charlie.  We've said everything that can be said.
Mr. Kane, how can I persuade you -
You see!  There hasn't been a true word -
Mrs. Kane would like to see you, Mr. Kane.
Is Mrs. Kane -
How did you get him to part with it, Mr. Kane?
They do it only because you do!
I mean I've got a job for you.
You start tomorrow night.  Richard Carl in "The Spring Chicken."  I'll get us some girls.  You get tickets.  A drama critic gets them free, you know.  Rector's at seven?
I said treason was a capital offense punishable by death -
They're true!  Everything I said! Witholding that veto was treason!
First of all -
First of all, I will not write a good review of a play because somebody paid a thousand dollars for an advertisement in the "Enquirer."
She can leave me.  As a matter of fact, I've already left her.  Don't worry, Brad - I'll live.
You still want to be transferred to the other paper?
Hello, Brad.
Oh, yes, the bonus.
It does seem too good to be true, doesn't it, Mr. Bernstein?
I'll sign those papers -
It's going to be done exactly the way I've told Mr. Thatcher -
Well, let's hope it's all for the best.
Sorry, Mr. Leland.
Maybe you could remember something that -
Oh, yes.  I know about Mr. Rawlston.
Well, that's about all there is - and I'm getting chills.  Hey, nurse!  Five years ago, he wrote from that place of his down South -  - you know.  Shangri-la?  El Dorado?  Sloppy Joe's?  What's the name of that place?  You know...  All right. Xanadu.  I knew what it was all the time.  You caught on, didn't you?
I want you to stop all this nonsense, Jim.
I want you to stop all this nonsense, Jim.
Yes, and maybe he didn't.
I didn't get a thing.  Just the music lessons.  That's all there was to it.
That's your lung. By this time, your lung looks like this.
Thanks. Have a good one.
You'd think she was marrying him. What are you watching?
She said not to come home until graduation.
God, isn't he great?
Why?
You saw it?
I was going to tell you. But then we were getting along so well, I didn't want to mess it up.
Was I right?
I love a macho façade. It's such a turn-on.  What smells like shoe polish?
I just told you.
Look how full of yourself you are.
Good. Stay in that frame of mind.
I don't know. Maybe we should just see what happens.
The Dante Hicks Dinner and a Movie Date. I think I've been on that one before.
I offer you my body and you offer me semantics? He's just a boyfriend, Dante, and in case you haven't gotten the drift of why I came all the way here from Ohio, I'm about to become single again.  And yes-let me placate your ego-you are the inspiration for this bold and momentous decision, for which I'll probably be ostracized at both school and home. You ask me who I choose, I choose you.
Promise me it'll always be like that.
When you just lie perfectly still and let me do everything.
Stop this. This isn't funny.
Are you sure somebody was back there?
There's a strange man in our bathroom, and he just raped Caitlin!
Wait a second? Who was working here today?
I thought you just said you played hockey and went to a funeral.
With this guy locked in?
What the fuck is this?! I want some service!
Who are you to make assessments?
That's easy to say from over here.
Are you open?
The boss called. Arthur fell ill.
Want something to drink? I'm buying.
She called me.
Interesting postscript to that story: Do you know who wound up going with Brad Michaelson in the other dark bedroom?
I'm serious. Aside from the cheating, we were a great couple.  That's what high school's all about-algebra, bad lunch, and infidelity.
I think the arguments Veronica and I are having are some kind of manifestation of a subconscious desire to break away from her so that I can pursue the possibility of a more meaningful relationship with Caitlin.
Me pulling a can off some moron's fist.
Empire.
The Emperor.
I guess.
It would stand to reason, yes.
More or less.
Something just never sat right with me the second time they destroyed it. I could never put my finger on it-something just wasn't right.
Well, the thing is, the first Death Star was manned by the Imperial army- storm troopers, dignitaries-the only people onboard were Imperials.
The second time around, it wasn't even finished yet. They were still under construction.
A construction job of that magnitude would require a helluva lot more manpower than the Imperial army had to offer. I'll bet there were independent contractors working on that thing: plumbers, aluminum siders, roofers.
She's in here?
The quest isn't going well?
Oh, it's great. You step into this little booth and there's this window between you and this naked woman, and she puts on this little show for like ten bucks.
Thirty-seven!
At least we're stuck here together.
Are you gonna lock the store?
Bitch, bitch, bitch. You want something to drink?
After an exhausting game like that I can believe it.
How? When?
What!?
You've gotta watch the store. I have to go to this.
Stop it. This is beneath even you.
She meant nothing to you!
I can't close the store.
An embolism in a pool.
Broke his neck.
Shut the hell up.
Stop it.
Oh, my god.
You know.
Can you imagine being halfway decent to the customers at least some of the time?
May I be blunt with you?
So your argument is that title dictates behavior?
The reasons you won't let me borrow your car is because I have a title and a job description, and I'm supposed to follow it, right?
I thought you never sold cigarettes to kids.
Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now?
Wow. You've had quite an evening.
I feel so ineffectual. Is there anything I can do for you?
Hey, what about Veronica?
You're a snake.
You want me to bring the VCR over here so we can watch this?
Maybe the Asian design major slipped her some opium?
She said she did all the work.
This life?
It's true. You'll sit there and blame life for dealing a cruddy hand, never once accepting the responsibility for the way your situation is.
I'm satisfied with my situation for now. You don't hear me bitching. You, on the other hand, have been bitching all day.
Am I right or what?
What? The dead guy?  She'll get over fucking the dead guy. Shit, my mom's been fucking a dead guy for thirty years; I call him Dad.
Who're you kidding? You can so.
How's your eye?
I thought I was doing you a favor.
Go open the video store.
How many times I gotta tell you not to deal outside the store.
Noinch, noinch, noinch-smoking weed, smoking weed! Doing coke!  Drinking beers!  A pack of wraps, my good man. It's time to kick back, drink some beers, and smoke some weed!
Listen to you. Oh shit. "Oh, I don't hang out with drug dealers."
I work, just like you. You're more of a crook than I am, dude.
All right. How much is Pepsi here?
At Food City it's ninety-nine cents, plus tax.
That's fucked up. Yo, I heard he was jerkin' off.
Is she that girl who's down here all the time? She came here today carrying a plate of food.
And what-you were gonna dump her to date that Caitlin chick?
Be careful.
The white kind.
Actually, it is kind of rough.
I said go ahead.
All I'm saying is that if you're unhappy you should leave.
Don't you have a hockey game at two?
How do you know they're taking the right amount of change? Or even paying for what they take?
Three?
Wow. That's great. That's something to be proud of.
Shit! Why are we getting up?
What do you mean?
You sucked his dick!
HOW MANY?
Well...?
You couldn't get these shutters open?
You're damn right it's not like that! Because I won't let it be like that! You want your slut? Fine!  The slut is yours!
You hold the counter and I'll pull.
It stings a little.
Were you working here at about four o'clock?
Yeah, but I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids!
I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! I swear!
Is he staying here?
I think the lady called it.
It's probably from being around all this food every day.
I beg your pardon!
Well this is the last time I ever rent here...
That's the price, my brother.
My man is deaf.  I'M GOING TO JOHN K'S PARTY!  Neh.
The only place I don't bring my drugs is church. And that ain't till Sunday morning.
I know. I've been here since eleven.
Dental School.
Twenty bucks?
Gabe!  Hey, man!  Gabe!  It's Gabe!
Hey, Gabe, we're flyin' off the Tower today.  C'mon with us.
"It's a perfect day for a monster jump."  Hey man, can you like do me a favor?
Answer the man.
He said the Tower, but he's on Comb Bluff?  Frank, fly me to the west valley, the winds are never too bad there and it's only a half hour climb to the Douglas Shaft.
A monkey?
You know how the airlines are.
Tucker?
Copy.  Jessie, go to the top of Bitker ladder.
Glad you could drop in.
Can't pass up another chance to play hero, can you.
Thanks for staying around when you didn't have to.
What are we going to do?
Take the gun.
Then turn it off, Gabe, because it doesn't get any better.
You're saying, I don't understand?  I'm the <u>only</u> one who does understand.  I'm the one you lived with for two years, I'm the one you made promises to, I'm the one who spent too many nights looking up at these rocks and wondering if you were ever going to make it down in once piece or ever at all.  Believe me, there's been times I didn't know what I wanted to do more, love you or hate you.  But the one thing in our relationship that I did know and still do know is that I <u>understand you</u>.
Gabe, did you come back to stay?  You didn't.
What if he can't?
I know you don't want to be responsible for anybody's life anymore, but walk away and you are responsible.  Please Gabe, he went up the west ridge.  If you go up the south face, you can catch him, no problem--
I can't believe you just said that.
A simple yes or no would have done.
We might be able to go that way.
Pull it apart!
Frank!  No, Frank!  Frank!
Gabe!
There's no "we".  There's a me. All I have to do is make it along the north wall to Bitker Ladder. What you're doing is going back down to the station to get help. And don't put on that mad face.
But maybe with a good start I can hit those hand-holds.
An' if I miss, dig in and try your best to slow the fall.
Just kidding.
You said there was a way across.
No, the goddamn game's not over! It's never over when you're playing against a team that doesn't care if they win or lose-- how do you negotiate with someone like that?!
On top of the peak.
You and Frank get the tents, thermal clothing, and medical supplies together.
You gotta be kidding me!  Do you want me to fly up after you? Over.
Travers!  Hurry it up.
Bring down the money or your friend's dead!
Man against nature, right Travers.
He's alive!
This is insane.  The hell with the money.  You radio in for that chopper, understand!
Why the hell are we wasting time here?!
Matheson has been transferred from the Denver office to Frisco. As a professional courtesy between offices, I was asked if he could hitch a ride.
I think Treasury personnel are the most superstitious people in the federal government.
Pardon me. Luce. He raises glass to breast, pulls red handle between her legs. Milk spurts into glass. Dim joins the others. Alex looks at a party of tourists.
What did you do that for?
He are here! He have arrived! Hooray!
I'm so pleased you appreciate good wine. Have another glass!
I'm sorry to hear about that, sir. His face contorted in rage.
And now you, another victim of the modern age. But you can be helped. I phoned some friends while you were having a bath.
Excuse me, missus, can you please help? There's been a terrible accident. Can I please use your telephone for an ambulance?
Hi, hi, hi there, at last we meet.
Naughty, naughty, naughty, you filthy old soomaka.
Yes, sir. I suppose you might call it that, sir.
You've not been to school all week, son.
Eeee... I'll put your breakfast in the oven. I've got to be off myself now.
Cut out all this clever talk about milicents. Just because the Police haven't picked you up lately doesn't, as you very well know, mean that you've not been up to some nastiness. There was a bit of a nastiness last night, yes. Some very extreme nastiness, yes. A few of a certain Billyboy's friends were ambluenced off late last night, yes. Your name was mentioned, the word's got thru to me by the usual channels. Certain friends of yours were named also. Oh, nobody can prove anything about anybody as usual, but I'm warning you, little Alex, being a good friend to you as always, the one man in this sore and sick community who wants to save you from yourself. Deltoid makes a grab for Alex's joint but finds his hand instead. Alex laughs. Derisively and rises. Deltoid distractedly reaches for a glass of water on the night table, and fails to notice a set of false teeth soaking in them. He drinks from the glass. The clink of the teeth sounding like ice-cubes.
Nobody's got anything on me, brother, sir. I've been out of the rookers of the milicents for a long time now.
When you say this funny feeling, you mean the state of mind brought on by the treatment they gave you?
Do you still feel suicidal?
Good. Real horrorshow. Initiative comes to them as waits. I've taught you much, my little droogies. Now tell me what you have in mind, Georgie Boy.
Thank you very much for this chance, sir.
That's right, Dad they did a great job on my gulliver, I'm completely reformed.
What about Basil? Where's my snake?
What's gonna happen to me then? I mean that's my room he's in - there's no denying that. This is my home also. What suggestions have you, my Pee and Em, to make?
What gives, O my Pee and Em, what makes you think you are welcome? Em sobs. Pee comforts her.
Crime?
Do you wear eye glasses or contact lenses?
Have you ever had any mental illness?
Do you wear any false teeth or false limbs?
No, sir.
Indeed it is. May I take this She removes his tray.
Fine... fine.
Something like that.
Good. I'm doctor Taylor.
Patients who've sustained the kind of injuries you have often have dreams of this sort. It's all part of the recovery process.
One thing I could never stand is to see a filthy, dirty old drunkie, howling away at the filthy songs of his fathers and going blerp, blerp in between as it might be a filthy old orchestra in his stinking rotten guts. I could never stand to see anyone like that, whatever his age might be, but more especially when he was real old like this one was. The boys stop and applaud him.
Jamey Mack! Be the hokey fly! Holy Mother of God! All the Holy Angels and blessed saints in Heaven preserve us. Alex breaks away but the Tramp toddles alongside him.
If thou lose hope being weary in the days of distress, thy strength shall be diminished.
I've done my best, have I not?
One pair of trousers - blue pinstriped.
Mothballs, sir.
Don't read it - sign it!
Moloko-plus.
How many to a cell?
Hi ya' doin'?  Where to?
The Bowery, you gotta deal with runoff from two bridges.
You like Bach?
Could'a fooled me, the way you were hollering into that cell phone.
You're an anomaly in today's world, Max.  You're good at what you do, so you must take pride in it...?
This your current address?
You dizzy?  You want to sit down?
Get outta here!  You and Louis?
You know Dmitri?
I know the answer.  I know all there is to know about Louis.
Vincent.  Do not cross me.
You guys been holding hands?
Remember that thing a few years back? That thing with the cab?
Cabbie drove around all night.  Three people got killed.
Joey Cicerno.  Dear friend and associate of my missing snitch, Ivan Petrov.  Both of whom were in bed with Dmitri.
Client?  I like to think of myself as more of a friend.  A mentor.
I'm sure you're very proud of Max.
I got caught up at work.
I'm...in...the...room, here.  Don't talk about me like I'm not in the room.
I'm standing right here.
He's not paying you one cent!
Vincent <u>Farrell</u>, Assistant U.S. Attorney.  A passenger in this taxicab, and I'm reporting you to the DMV...
How am I supposed to not get excited, listening to you trying to extort your employee, you sarcastic prick?
Max?  Maaax.  Pick up, dipshit.
...what do you want me to do, punch him out?  I have to work with him...
Uh, let's go to...  Hello...?
How long you think this'll take?
You on some kind of work plan?
Why not?
Like what?
We have a deal.  What's your name?
No.  You say you're cool.
You were going to drive me around. Drop me at LAX.  Never be the wiser. But El Gordo missed the elevator.  So we go to Plan B.  Pop the trunk.
Got it?
Max.
You listening to me?
Try some deep breathing.
Oh.  Oh, no.  You're kidding.  We...
Chopin prelude.  Stodgy, but nice.  Here's the deal.  I didn't want you involved in this.  Still breathing? But now that you are, we have to make the best of it, Max.  Improvise.  Life is that way.  Adapt to your environment.  Survive.  Darwin.  "Shit happens."  The I Ching.  Whatever. Roll with it.
I don't know any Rwandans.
Get rid of 'em.
Hands on the wheel.  Ten and two o'clock, like they taught you in driver's ed.
Who's that?
It was an accident.  You're not liable.  Tell him.
Don't take that.  Tell him to shut the fuck up.
Another collateral.
...see now, this has got a little post- war flavor, a little Miles thing happening.  Awesome.  What do you think?
You go every night?
What the fuck was <u>that?</u>
Limos, huh?
Maybe so.  Maybe she hears what you tell her.
Yeah?  Like what?  Limos?
No client has ever seen my face, and I intend to keep it that way.  Besides, if he decides to put a bullet in my head, I don't wanna be there for it.
You get benefits?
Your lady friend.  The one who gave you her business card.  Think she was just being polite?
That's the "why."  That's the why? There is no reason.  No good reason; no bad reason.  To live or to die.
Look in the mirror.  ...piss-ant paper towels...a bottle of 409...saving up for goin' to the Comoros.  How much you got saved?
Slow down!
They said send you downstairs.
The sound of love.
Look, I'm sorry --
Mekong, my friend, Mekong.
The President's in Europe. Tomorrow he'll be in Turkey. Right along this fault line.  They launched the space shuttle yesterday.
You know, to be 'normal' and live in the 'real world,' to swallow Coca cola and eat Kentucky Fried Chicken, you have to be in a conspiracy <u>against yourself</u>.  I can't lie to me, Liza.  And the more I strip through the sham, the crazier I look to people like you. Can't you see that's what they're counting on?  You want to go out sometime?
People do have heart attacks.
He says a dog bit his nose.
What took so long?  You were in there all day.
If you're worried about the President, call and warn him about the Space Shuttle.
Uh uh, don't want <u>them</u> to see me.
Flat, wraparound headlights?
Crown Victoria.  F.B.I. car.  A legitimate tail.
So why are they after you?
You wouldn't be sitting here if you didn't halfway believe me.
You want something to drink?
If my universe had a hub...
'On July 8, 1979, security forces under control of the Trilateral Commission abducted the fathers of all American Nobel Prize winners. The men, many of them octogenarians, were forced at gunpoint to ejaculate into small plastic bottles.  The sperm collected is now under study in a laboratory beneath the headquarters of the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica, California.'
Was that who I thought it was?
That was him.
Please put it down.
Johnny Dancer, right?  You don't ride him anymore, do you?  Not since your dad died.
Did you see the van back there?
Never mind.  You'd think I was making it up.
I see the big picture and you stumble around in the details.
Do you watch the news?  Read the paper.  Last week, this whole place was underwater.
I -- It's like, I resolve to call you up 1000 times a day.  To ask you if you'll marry me in some old-fashioned way.  Everything you do is magic.
Are you okay?  I wish I hadn't told you what I did.  But I can't help the way I feel.  You don't hold that against me, do you?
We're going to Queens?
What about them?
Did you kill my father?!
Then tell me what happened.
Someone else might call it stalking.  My dad felt it.  He started carrying a gun.
How'd you get the picture?
I'm sorry.
Blue moon...
Do I know you?
I like that.  A gun to your head and you ask about your partner. He's okay.  May have a headache for a few days.  Are you here with honorable intentions?
You made your decision yet?
That's not what I mean.  I want to see her.
Here's a fresh one.  Why you? Your colleague Mr. Wilson says Jerry won't speak to anyone else. That seems oddly possessive behavior to me.
Jerry's visits to your office. Why do you tolerate them?  Why him?
Veritas.  Truth.  What is it they say about truth?
I didn't know the C.I.A. had psychiatrists.
Years ago, I worked for the C.I.A. in the M.K. ULTRA program.  Are you familiar with it?
A dog.
It's okay.  I'm game.
Night after that?
Liza, settle a bet for us.
That you come with me.
There's no plug to pull.
Is it possible...?
You don't believe it to be... tell me something, Doctor.  Why do you think they would go to all this trouble... bring you tens of thousands of light years, and then send you home without a shred of proof?  Sort of bad form, wouldn't you say?  What was their intent?
What in the hell...?
Nothing.  Okay.  Some of us have been a little... not concerned, exactly, but...
Two:  There's nothing out there but noble gasses and carbon compounds and you'd be wasting your time.
I disagree.
Pepsi?  Tequila?
Very well; since my appointment he's been made interim director.
Ellie...
Ms. President, this is communist paranoia right out of War of the Worlds.  There is no reason whatsoever to believe the ETIs intentions are hostile.  We pose no threat to them -- it would be like us going out of our way to destroy microbes on a beach in Africa.
What is it?  What's happened?
I'm asking for your help, David.  I want to go.  They'll need someone relatively young, unattached -- and probably a scientist.  As the President's Science Advisor you have enormous weight... I'm asking if you'll support my candidacy.
... And while its function remains, for the moment, a mystery, my best guess is that it represents a transport of some kind.
What...
Hydrogen times pi...  Got it.  Strong sucker.
That can't be right; it's only twenty-six light years away.
I don't have the figures in front of me, but yes, that sounds about right.
Could we hear to China?
Could we hear God?
Pensacola.
So we passed some kind of test?
That isn't the way it works.
Page after page of data -- over sixty-three thousand in all, if I'm not mistaken... and at the end of each...
As each component was tested and shipped off to Texas a duplicate was maintained and assembled in Hokkaido -- for backup purposes, of course. We've been right behind you the entire time.  You see my problem:  I couldn't appear to control too large a percentage; my enemies wouldn't stand for it.  So I simply made sure the Japanese consortium received the systems integration contract.  Of course no one had to know the corporations involved were recently acquired, wholly-owned subsidiaries --
He's an incredible prick but I never learned so much in my life.
Ellie.  Arroway.
... I'm just so sick of feeling defensive about the things I care about!  Or being lumped in with the lunatic fringe by people like Drumlin, when if they'd just put aside their preconceptions for two seconds and look at the facts...
It's like the pre-Copernicans who swore the sun revolved around the Earth, or the Victorians at the end of the last century who concluded that all major discoveries had now been made.  I mean... try to imagine civilization a thousand years ahead of us -- then imagine trying to explain... I dunno, a microwave oven -- to someone even a hundred years ago -- I mean the basic concepts didn't exist...
Please.  Any chance of that died the day David Drumlin was appointed head of the N.S.F.  I have been in contact with a few other SETI people; we've been trying to find backing from private investors. I've even managed to scrounge a couple of hours of telescope time here and there...
Peter -- if you can get him to do that for me he'd obviously do the same for you -- we could -- !
It's good to see you, Ellie.
Thank God.  When we lost contact, I thought -- we thought... but you're okay.  We're still trying to determine the nature of the malfunction.  Did you notice anything at all that --
What day?
'My father's house has many mansions.'
I was referring to the selectees mingling with the selectors.
Relativity.  Explain this to me one more time... even if you traveled near the speed of light, when you came back --
I'm more interested in the story behind the story... How a young man goes from living on the streets of South Boston to being the best- selling media figure rubbing elbows with the President.
I thought it was well-written. Heart-felt.  And a little bit naive... But that's just the enemy's perspective.
What are my other options?  In fifty years?  Never?
Fifty cents? Sweet job like that worth at least a buck.
Well, Arletta, I got to stand down here.
You think life is some kind of ocean voyage and you start out with buntin' and hollerin' and high hopes, but the damn ship goes down before you ever reach the other side. Luke?
What went wrong?
You allus had good jobs, and that girl in Kentucky I taken a shine to her.
Comin' out here, Boss?
What's all this dirt in the yard?
Please! Please!
It ain't my fault you don't know how to handle your dogs.
Here, Captain.
You gonna get used to wearing them chains aftera while, Luke. But don't you never stop listenin' to them clinkin'. That's gonna remind you of what I been sayin'.
You was to sell your job, maybe this Lucas War Hero would give you a price.
You can't do that!
She looks just like Mrs. Patricia Handy, a married woman... I useta fool with. Man, I kin sniff blondes from a hunnert yards and redheads from a mile and a half.
Oh, man, did you see her? Did you see her?
Uh-huh. And he ain't got nothing showing. Raise his head off.
So then you just call him.
Oh lookit that brunette.
A cold drink.
That's my baby.
Somebody say somethin'?
Shut your mouth 'bout my Lucille.
I'm gonna kill you, you go on...
Hey, buddy. Take it easy. You're making me look bad.
Look at Him go. Bam! Bam!
You don't understand a thing, do you, Drag?
Nobody kin eat fifty eggs.
Koko, write down their names, don't just make marks.
All right now: get mad at them eggs. Eat it there boy! Bite it! Gnaw on it!
Man, it's so hot.
Yeah, found one in this supermarket, keys in the ignition.
But -- but --
It's good medicine.
Where were you?  Don't tell me. It's just under seventy, right?  The sun is strong but the air is dry and fresh...
I got it myself... I couldn't wait.
Oh God.  I'm really crazy.
We'll get the paramedics...
He took pains to hide his actions because he knew they were morally wrong.  He was not acting on mad impulse.  He was sane and acting out a pattern he carefully followed every time.
He told me he had done two others just like it.
When he was seventeen.
Who are you?
I was?  How you spell that?
You don't listen very good.  This break in -- I can call it a felony -- three strikes, and you got about sixteen strikes already, and you're in jail for the rest of your life, no parole.  Or I could see it gets forgotten.
No, that's still in my jacket I was wearing.  We were supposed to meet on the docks, that number 47 wharf, 10 o'clock Friday.  He's gonna hand me 500 bucks.
She's supposed to have it.
What book?
I'll look for it, Daryll Lee.
Ah ha.  What did he want?
You've been perfect.  Don't spoil the symmetry -- you have to have a male cop.
We'll keep talking.  Until they get here.  Then...
Who is this?
No, ma'am.  This is no joke.  And neither is tying up telephone lines to police with crank calls while people in trouble are trying to get through for help.
Do you have any evidence to report, ma'am?  Do you know any of the victims...
I think you are.  I really admire everything you've done; it would be an honor to work with you, and we need all the help we can get, especially yours.
How do you know that?
We'll show that to...
That's amazing.  A whole new book, thought up in a minute.  Very good.  All I know how t do is get up, take a shower, and go to work. Hope, if he does another I'll nail the son of bitch, and they'll spell my name right in the newspaper. Where is Andy going?
Ruben.
I did not; the Mouth -- that's what we call Susan Schiffer -- got it on her own.
Helen, hang up, let Ruben get on with his work...
'...great dark hall of fame... all our greatest killers...'  His greatest <u>heroes</u>?  He wants to be famous.  When they're caught and people like me write about them, we give them a kind of immortality. They get thousands of letters. Ramirez kills eight women and gets a hundred marriage proposals a month.  They're like film stars.
Let's speed up the game plan... call all the living serials to ask if they've had contact with a Peter Kurten.  We could use some help on the phones...
The University computer is down for maintenance, but I've been going through my own notes...
How many do you need to sleep. Really sheep?
Helen.  I saw him die.  I saw him burning on the basement stairs, he never reached the top.
This has been the worst 48 hours of my life.  I'm going home.  I'm going to try to get drunk.
Somebody is imitating his m.o. Look for a plumber or carpenter or handyman; that's how deSalvo got in the door and caught them off guard.
We're through for the night, aren't we?  You go on.  Get some sleep. I'll stay until we can get a man out here and maybe catch a cab home.
Tell me what to do!
You know how to use this?
I was just about to advise the Inspector here not to show Dr. Hudson the note.
Michael Johnson.
Don't put yourself down like that. I <u>never</u> used you.  I worked my way up like a marine grunt!
My third grade teacher at the convent shot better than that.
Nada.  Lemme make the call.
Is Niccoletti <u>assigned</u> here?
You damn well better start working on that impulse control.  A woman who is implicated in this case? Someone who's practically a piece of <u>evidence</u>?
What's Abba?
We're gonna have a bunch of clapped out old hippies blissing on the Grateful Dead!  Sleeping in the park, smoking dope and sticking tulips up their ass.
You ever reflect how this big explosion in dead women coincides with the flowering of women's lib?
Christ.  How old are you?  You sure you want to be in this line of work?
Where you going?
What the hell you need her for?
You want mine, too?  You take his, you take mine.  I'm the one fucked it up...
We were together six years, sir!
I don't want the job.  Don't do that to her.  She's worked too damned hard for it.
She doesn't lie!  You sure you fed her?
Where were you?
Did you come?
There, that's better.
Have you seen it?
I wish I had. They bury the dead so quickly - they should leave them lying around for months.
Have you seen his penis?
You'd better drive him. He's a bit shaky. I'll follow in my car. Where is yours?
The airport? Why? Are you leaving?
I've found that I enjoy burying myself in heavy traffic. I like to look at it. Yesterday I hired a taxi driver to drive me around for an hour. "Anywhere", I said.
Isn't that rather too close...?
You were the last one I saw just before the accident. Do you remember? We made love.
Can you drive?
Do you live here? With Seagrave?
I've always wanted to drive a crashed car.
I need to see you, Ballard. I need to talk to you about the project.
Hello, Letitia. I'm Dr. Emlee, and I have some questions to ask you...
What kind of place is this?
The medicine's still bothering me. It feels like I have cotton wrapped around my brain.
I thought about calling, but I want to wait until I know when I'll be out.
What's up with you?
Things have been kind of stressful lately.
Mom, please.
I gather he's late as usual.
Mom, we agreed. You can visit, but you're not allowed to mention Michael.
I don't know why you feel you have to lie, Letty.
If you feel lonely, or need to talk, all you have to do is say so.
First off, Letty, can you tell me where you are?
No, 79. Sorry, this makes me nervous.
Yes?   Go right ahead.
Was it bad news--the visit from Peter?
Guess which hand.
For a price.
Nervous? Scared? Worried you're not fit for a caper of epic proportions?
What's my rap?
I have a terrible confession.
It's a good thing my family loves you.
It's OK. You don't have to say anything.
John and Nurse Gates are waiting for you.
Just checking.
Furnished?
Where to?
Wow.
I love the pillows.
Not yet.
I'm supposed to meet the principal in half an hour.
I bombed. It's either work in the office or nothing.
I think I should go home.
That's OK. We can call and reschedule in the morning.
You're going to miss the Top Ten.
Hey, Letty. Mrs. Mayer.
Oh. And, Harry, he's the one who likes magic?
Something like that.
Bye, Uncle Cort.  What's with the lie?
Silly, silly, silly.
So, another one bites the dust.
My math program. The Superintendent said he'd fund it.
Yeah?
But I thought if you don't mind, you could listen and see how I come across?
What are you doing?    You're going to be late.
You don't have a fever.
Forget I asked.
It's just I've got those parent conferences, and I'm supposed to set up the math program by next week. And shopping for Ruth's dress and that, that engagement dinner.
Yeah.
What are you doing?
It's prettier here than I thought it would be.
I had to smuggle it in here. I guess you're not really supposed to have jewelry.
It's a doctor, isn't it? That's unethical. I'll have him rung up on malpractice charges so fast his head will spin.
You're going to throw away our life together for some shared experience with a looney-tune that you misguidedly think is love?
What?
The Superintendent was just getting ready to leave.
Well, I understand.     I know my behavior was poor.
It's a very nice letter. But I have to go with what's best for the students.
How's it look?
Yeah.   I figured I'd be hearing from you.
What about me? Aren't I a loose end?
Uh... excuse me, but don't you need a warrant or something?
Hey man, you can't do that!
No.
Where's your brother?
Daniel. Listen I'm afraid there has been a big--
Okay. I understand you're interested in one of our properties?
-- Super what?
Frankie, come in. Good to see you.      You want something?
They're gonna be what?
Uh, no --
What is happening with the world? There was a time no civilian would touch a made man. Now every babbo in the world thinks he can get away with something. What did they take?
And for my help I would get what?
And the other half?
I only have your word for that.
I don't know.
Not a good idea. Someone gets a license number and it all leads back to you. Raymond, you'll steal one.
Get that, will you?
Turn on the flashlight.
Do they come with batteries?
You think it's smart to tell him we're French?
You're sure?
Fuck you! You know I'd never go along with something like this.
You call being Bastaldi's lap dog better?
This is Zero.
After the outside alarm is off we go in through the bedroom window.
It's not?
They'll be waiting for us at the airport.
All right, knock it off.
Hadley --
I will.
Did you have to use that much explosive?
And, uh, I'm going to have to charge you a commission... kind of like a brokerage fee.
Maybe you should call the police.
Tell me the truth Hector... do you think we'll find my car?
What'd I tell you? Huh, Vinny? What'd I tell you when you came to me for money? Didn't I ask you not to do it? Did I not say that?  What'd I say to him?
Hey boss, it's not a science.
Just find them!
And the other car?
Are you forgetting who supplements your income?
I'm Sami.    Marcel sent me.
This kind.
Maybe I'm missing the obvious, but why aren't we leaving town? Any place has to be safer for us than Chicago.
A Black Panther was a member of an African American militant group in the sixties, Marcel. I think you're referring to The Pink Panther.
Today's your lucky day, Sami.
Why would they want us to rob the Mafia?
It's good.
Fine. All of you want to be angry? Be angry... but I'm the one who took the ball and that makes it mine.
Who is closer to the wall, Joey or me?
I'm telling you that's my car!   And someone's gonna pay for it!
I understand. The person who sent me wishes to help you.
I'm glad you didn't get something flashy.
You're not helping.
The new Beaujolais' come out in France next week. You like wine?
You put a loaded gun in your bag and brought it through customs? How stupid is that?
So, how did you get hooked up with these guys?
The art world doesn't fully appreciate my talent yet. I needed some way to pay the rent. Laurant and Vincent pay well for information.
Casandra. Old girlfriend?
I'm sorry things went so wrong today.
Sounds boring.
Oh really? Thanks. I thought it was a sewing machine. What the hell is it doing here?
Who are you?
Where's your master?
Who are you?  Why is the Green Destiny in your possession?
Put them down.
This spells trouble.
But I have had much practice.  As a child in the West, a platoon lived with us.  They'd let me play with their weapons.  The scabbard is so beautiful.
Yes, I am.  But I prefer the machete.  Certain moves, however, call for a sword.
I've missed you.
I'm hardly doing a thing.  The less I think of it the better.  My parents are arranging everything. The Gous are a very powerful family. My marrying one will be good for my father's career.
About you and Li Mu Bai?
Too bad for Meng, but it's not your fault, or Li Mu Bai's.
Here you must be in proper attire.
They forced me to marry!
You know about Lo?
Out here, you always fight for survival.  You have to be part of a gang to stand a chance.  Slowly, your gang becomes your family.  All that Dark Cloud stuff is just to scare people and make my life easier.
Don't send me back!
Good.  And how are you?
You use it justly, you're worthy of it.
I didn't think she'd dare come back to Peking!
No, I'd already sent them home. You can blame me for losing the sword, but please trust that I'll get it back soon using my own methods.
That's not for her.  She should come to Wudan and become a disciple.
I thought by giving away the sword, I could escape the Giang Hu world. But the cycle of bloodshed continues.
Don't you want to see her again.
Shu Lien... The things we touch have no permanence.  My master would say... there is nothing we can hold on to in this world.  Only by letting go can we truly possess what is real.
I'll look around and catch up later.
What happened?
Yes.  The very killer of Li Mu Bai's own master.  Last night, she killed a policeman who had tracked her down.
It's Jade Fox!
You're mistaken.  We're just street performers.  We were rehearsing.
I don't know...
I beg your pardon.  Li Mu Bai and I aren't cowards.
Sir Te, can you find some excuse to invite Madam Yu and her daughter?
Sure it coulda.  Funboy's not here, neither is T-Bird -- none of Top Dollar's number ones.
Talent. Hi.
Speak up.  Clear it with the Captain if you need a file.
Could be.
Mom --?
Oh wow, oh wow, don't fucking do that, man.  I nearly had a fucking heart attack.
It's just the dope, don't worry
My mom works over there.  I'm waiting for her, but she's probably with him, right now.
Does she have a name?
I remember him!  Here, Gabriel... here kitty... Gabriel... Is he still yours?
Shelly would've wanted you to have it.  This way, you'll think of her every time you see it...
I don't know if I can.  But you have this... and you know where to come.
Chili dog for breakfast... it's original.
Top Dollar, you're the only one here still wasting good air...
A year ago.  A very nice lady circulated a petition.  She died. Last Halloween.  Answer yes or no.
Who gives a fuck!  I'm a businessman.  You gonna do me, then do me and shut you're face!
I wish to possess what you have now.
Sooner or later, my action were destined to bring me a genuine Fury.  And it turned out to be you. At last.  I appreciate your abilities as few mortals can. That's why I desire them.
Neither.
Having fun yet?  No?  I'll give you a hint.  Remember whatshername?
Miss her?
Getting a little ambitious and extracurricular, aren't we?
Do you think this childish machismo impresses me?  When I was a boy in Saigon I watched my country change one block at a time,  one building at a time.  Whole lives erased.  A way of life, polluted.  Today, no one forces me to move.  I use my powers to change your country, one block at a time,  one building at a time.
You heard me.
I have his journal.
He told you he's failing in love with you? I've never known him to say those words before.
No. I mean. I don't know.  What else do you know about him?
How do you know I've been with several women?
Well maybe you should get to know the person before you judge them instead of listening to some bullshit gossip.
Who the hell is taking the time to write letters, spreading this shit about me?
Excuse me. Excuse me!
The Fountainhead.
You need help.
Give me a minute. I'll be right down.
You know it amazes me that someone as bright as you can be so horrible.
Do you deny that there's an attraction between us?
Need a lift?
Oh right, last night. I guess I owe you an apology.
I'm... I'm alright.
I don't know? Maybe I'd like it. I'm trying to change here. You could be supportive.
Am I bothering you?
Bonjour Monsieur Philipe.
I just came to say goodbye.
Back to the city. I may take off to Europe for the rest of the summer. I just can't handle it around here.
Please don't go.
I'm fine. I have to get going to my friends' house.  Was it --
You don't know how to love.
It's a beautiful home you have here Mrs. Rosemond.
My mother and I used to ride a lot, before she got sick.
Are you shitting me?
I think he's telling the truth Valmont. Greg couldn't write a grocery list let alone a letter.
Oh, I suck. I suck.
So, rumor has it that you went on a date with Court Reynolds. I hear he's very nice.
Really? Bulimic headcase.
Listen to me. Your mother must never know. Never.
I want you to make me copies of his letters and bring them to me.
Cecile if there's one thing I'm great at it's love letters. With my help, he'll be eating out of the palm of your hand. Perhaps we can arrange a little get together for the two of you at my house.
Cecile, you have to tell me.
Why didn't you do something?
Now listen. Now that you're on your way, it would be stupid of you to stop. Think of Sebastian as a tutor. Let him instruct you.
What are you doing?
Okay, okay. I'll just call your mom and have her come pick you up.
Just a kiss, right?
But -
Want a blow job?
Jesus. We've been at this for six months.
But you said you have the worst reputation.
This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. I'm trying to help you.
No it doesn't. I see right through you.
My daughter, Rachel.
Don't even think about it. Rachel is an exceptionally well rounded young woman, who happens to be attending Princeton this fall. She's way too smart to fall for your line of b.s.
Good luck, Sebastian.
Yes.
McConnell, I'm gonna out your ass in two seconds if you don't tell me where she is.
What do you do? Tell her you love her.
What do you mean?
I'd be careful if I were you. God knows what he's up to.
Will you stay here for the night? You can leave in the morning. That's when my parents get back and --
I don't find this very funny,
I need you to seduce our young Cecile. Introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery.
You can put it anywhere.
Loser.
I rat Cecile out to mommy. Mommy goes ballistic and ends their relationship. Boo hoo.
I hate when things don't go my way. It makes me so horny.
Any day now.
Who are you calling?
Before we go through with this, I just want you to be aware of the damage we're going to cause.
So? How'd it go last night?
If your asking if I nailed her the answer is no.
I'm sorry. It's just upsetting. You're in love with her. You don't love me anymore.
Why so nervous?
Get out? We had an arrangement.
I can't tell you how happy we are that Cecile is going to be attending Oakwood with you this fall. You've always been an inspiration to Beau and I on raising her. We just hope she can rise to the high standards which you've set for her.
I got your message and came as quick as I could.
I'm paying you to give cello lessons. Not to pervert my child.
Got me off the streets? I live on 59th and Park.
I'll do that.
Did I ever tell you the time when my late husband sent me -
Uh huh. You beat me three times.
I understand. Thanks for letting me crash here.
Did you hit her?
to a situation) Really, Mr. Reed, there isn't anything to worry about. It was only a slap --
I'm so glad to have met you at last. You're just as nice as Amy told me you were.  I hope you'll come to see us.
But it is a part of our lives too --a part of our past, It's a Goya reproduction. Those three cats --  are supposed to be the most beautifully drawn cats in Western art.
It's perfectly normal for a child to dream. I can see how a sensitive little girl, finding this portrait, would take the image of this woman and make of her an imaginary friend. That image dwells only in her imagination, and that image can go as quickly as it was born.
Where did you get this ring?
Someone gave it to you? Where was this old house?
Mommy, could Edward take me to Mrs. Farren's house to give her her present?
Well, it shows imagination, anyhow.
I'd hate her to grow up like that.
My, my, what a coil we're in! What's this all about?
You're shouting at me.
It's your play.
Oliver, please. Let's not go on with this. The child's trembling.
I thought you were with Amy.
No, darling, I hadn't intended to.
But where is that?
I shall wear it in my hair!
May I pet the deer?
You?
A ring that I can wish on like I wished on the candles?
You're going to be busy all day long, Edward.
Bad luck to see death in the snow.
Because it can't. It's dead.
But my mother says I mustn't accept gifts from strangers.
I like stories.
Hurry, hurry.
Promise me you won't forget tomorrow. You'll remember, won't you? You won't say that it was just a dream. Promise me.
There's a present you haven't opened yet, ma'am.
It's some animal hurt in the woods that made that sound.
I thought we were going to save those leaves you were burning for the compost bin.
I didn't even have to coax her tonight.
"To Daddy from Amy." Here's one for Miss Callahan. This one says, "To Edward from Amy.".
I know it may seem stupid of me--but it isn't the slap I'm worried about -- it's the reason.
Waiter! She needs more water.
No.
What?
I mean body temperature. Do you have a fever?
How have you been feeling?
Sounds all stress related. Your teeth may feel sharper if you're grinding them at night. You don't seem hairy to me. Is that all?
Yeah even then look what happened: Michael Mortenson kissed you and Billy Sullivan threw a worm at me.
I wonder what it's like being you. Being noticed all the time.
Sorry. It's just so bad lately. You're so lucky you never get PMS.
Or if there's a full moon.
I think she broke the skin.
I don't see anything. Maybe just a little.
Hey, did you get contacts?
He's dead? Am I bad luck or what?
Why would they exaggerate?
No, did you fuck him?
Did you get smashed or what? You have to eat if you're drinking. And not just those little salads.
I guess you're off that vegetarian kick you've been on for ten years.
What? Why the hell did he do that?
At least your PMS is over.
No he didn't. Come on, I don't want to be alone with those two. All they talk about is basketball and it bores the hell out of me.
What did he say?
You might want to tape your nipples down next time. It's really distracting.
Yes they are! Look how much more hair I have than you!
Maybe the blood was from your period like before.
DON'T call the police.
You say murder, but you have no idea what happened. You don't remember doing it, so it's out of your control.
If you ask me, the fucker got what he deserved. I'm glad he's dead.
I think I just got my period.
"The female-cycle werewolf will only kill men and never kills someone she truly loves." See I knew you never loved Mark.
She died at age 34 in the 1800's. They thought she was crazy. She was banished from her town. Seems her husband shot her.
I tried to kill myself -- earlier. It doesn't work. I think I need silver bullets. So I got depressed and when I'm depressed I clean.
No. I can't take that chance. I'd rather kill myself.
You're kidding, really?
No. Really, I'm... I don't feel well. I've got terrible PMS.
Oh come on. Knock it off.
You look different. I mean you look good.
Hey wait, I paid three bucks for that burger. You owe me...
It's a matter of life and death.
Wow.
The Nielson's?
Coffee and...
When's the last time you saw him?
No... no... this is embarrassing. I was returning your pillowcase... and I saw you cross the street... and I sort of started following you. I just find you really intriguing. I don't know why.
Oh, it's nothing.
Cool. I don't get guys who wear boxers. My ex wore boxers. I never got how he could wear khakis and not have his boxers bunch up.
What's wrong?
Everything okay?
No, no... But Mark -- a jealous boyfriend gone mad. Maybe he kills men you date.
I need to talk to you. About us. Frida... I... Can I carry your box?
What happened?
Except Mark of course.
Is that how you feel?
You didn't say it.
What's with the squirt guns?
Yes, your PMS. Frida I can deal with that.
If you don't like me, just say so. You don't have to make up some bullshit like you're a werewolf.
Peter I love you too but...
Sure. Cheating, lying. What's a little werewolf a few days a month? We can move out to the country where you can feed off deer.
No way can anything be proved. All they have are some wolf hairs. No one believes in werewolves.
It's about Gregory Jameson. He's dead.
So I asked the bartender what "coyote ugly" meant. It's like the "bagger" system. You know, a two- bagger -- someone so ugly that you need two bags -- one bag to put on their head and another one in case it blows off. Or a three-bagger...
It's for you. Frida.
I'm supposed to put up with a fuckin' cat I'm allergic to cause your friend's got PMS?
You have some weird friends. What does her thinking she's a werewolf have to do with us having the cat?
Frida's sheets checked out fine. It was just her own blood. From her... you know.
Hey, there was a lot of blood.
What?
This is more than fishy, this chick dates a dude and he winds up dead.
Poseur was missing a chunk of his neck. And his eyes were open. That always bugs me out. Do me a favor, if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, remind me to close my fuckin' eyes.
He means the last that we know of.
You think mafia hit?
What the fuck are you following me for? I'm not a suspect here.
Did we get those DNA tests back?
All the same entry wounds.  It's definitely him.  She lives...  lived here.  A prostitute.
Police.  Nobody move.
You seem a little edgy.  Everything okay?
Please, they'll kill me...
Why do you want to speak to him?
Iím your new assistant.
You wonít regret this, sir.
Who is it?
I need everything on the Jonathan White case.
Don't know that either.
Go on.
Jesus!  We have to get you to a doctor...
Such a joker!  Like your father.
Someoneís after me.
Donít kill me!
Ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't it?  Is there nothing <u>you</u> remember?  Not even a detail?   You must try.
I cannot say...  You don't know the answer to that?
What are you doing?
If you would only take this, inject it in your brain, everything would be much clearer.
What are you hiding?
First Lady...
First thing we're gonna work on is the mannerisms.  Alan has put together sort of a training program
Dave...
Be a professional. If you can convince her - - you can convince anybody.
Mr. President...
That shelter was in this bill.
Uh, Mr. President... I don't believe that's on your agenda today.
They say it hit both sides of his brain... Even if he makes it he's gonna be a vegetable.
I don't give a shit.
Her?... Oh -- the First Lady...  She was giving that commencement speech up in Bryn Mawr.  I managed to catch her before she left the hotel.
I told her his blood pressure went up after a little incident at  `the hotel.' She seems to hate him more than ever.
What about the wife?
Are you threatening me?
I don't think so
What happened?
No.
Well,  let's say your mother was in the car and you had to get her to a hospital.  You'd do it then for sure wouldn't you?
Now,  let's say the whole country. Was in that car.   The entire United States of America.
The teleprompter.  Is it hooked up?
At a press conference.
Gimme a quarter.
Let's call it a night.   I can't take any more.
Alan...
Yes, Mr. President?
Oh... Hi.
... Sometimes they do.
You ever think back to how you started.
How'd you get started?
You're not?
So you just protect the President the whole time?   That's your whole job?
I was waiting for that jack.
You sure you don't want a lift back home?
You bet.
Kind of reminds me of that thing you did back in the state legislature.
I mean, what is it?  Another Secretary? A jaunt to the Bahamas with Some 'campaign worker.'  Where is he?
How were you gonna get home?
You don't have to keep walking with me.   I'm okay from here.
So what do you do the rest of the time?
You know, secretaries and stiff.
It was okay?
What?
What's wrong?
Hi.
I missed...
Try to find someone who looks like me this time.  That last guy was a joke.
Who's this priest I'm thanking?
Oh yeah.  Did you take care of later on?
Please...senor...destroy me...one bullet...please.
Where are your headquarters, rebel? Tell me or I'll let you hang there forever...FOREVER!
Help me get him to the boat.
What is it?
You'd hold us back. We have to go on.
Miss Henried, I think you better...
Tonight?
That's the man. He's been holed up here ever since the shit hit the fan. Him and his family owned these islands 'round here. They was leasin' this one to the Fed. The whole underneath is dug out. There was missiles here and laboratories and bomb proof housing, nuclear power, all o' that. Now this is Dickerson's....Gasparilla's... private fortress. Him and a bunch o' his cronies from all the best golf courses in Tallahassee...and his private army, of course.
Thanks. I can fight my own battles.
Curse?
It's a disease. It's a...a bug...a parasite that infects the brain.
They seem to be havin' a good time. Some punishment.
Let me go! I'm the one he wants. This is all happening because of me. If I turn myself in...
Looks like just two. We can take 'em when the time comes.
How long do we have to watch him?
What?
Oh, no. I'm tryin' to get off this island alive. I'll help you all I can but I'm not goin' in there on a suicide mission. What can you hope to accomplish? Some radios maybe? A supply room or two? You'll all be killed and in a few weeks they'll be back to business as usual. That place was built to withstand nuclear attack! What are you gonna do with a half-dozen guns and a few sticks of nitro?
This stuff really works? No shit?
If you could knock out the central communications room you could foul up their whole intercom system. Then, if you move fast enough, stay ahead of 'em...without bein' able to signal each other, they might have a hard time catchin' you.
Prayers have no power to save. The knife can save. It can cut the disease away. The bullet. It can shatter the brain where the evil takes seed. These are saviours...our new saviours...our only saviours.
Aaaaaaah...my God...my God...I am heartily sorry...for having offended Thee....offended Thee...
NOOOOOOOOO!
You gave them a fresh taste of blood!
Some of Rhodes' men. At the door.
It's because of me.
Mary.
No time for that. I'll take care of them.
What'dya get?
All I'm saying is we have to be careful. We can't get caught.
I'm in as long as we're careful.
How'd it go?  Did you read it to her?
What do you mean you don't know?
Well, welcome to "Hell"ton.
Anything else you'd care to rifle through, Mr. Dalton?
Welton Academy, hello?  Yes, he is, just a moment.  Mr. Nolan, it's for you.
Who else was involved in this?
Nuwanda, what is going on?
Why don't you talk to Mr. Keating about it?
It's all right, Chet.
Oh Chet, that feels fabulous,
Pleased to meet you.
So, uh, where are you in school?
Hello?
carpe breastum.  Seize the breast.
Of course just like that.  That's how you always know when it's right.
Chet?  To a play? Are you kidding?
The hoi polloi.  Doesn't it mean the herd?
We used to meet here on special occasions. Who would like to convene the meeting?
Again!  Louder!
Excellent!  Have him act.  Give it rhythm!
Mr. Keating? Sir? Oh Captain My Captain.  What was the Dead Poets Society?
Oh Captain, My Captain, we came here so I could talk to you about something.
Too bad.
Damn.  Damn!  If I could just get Chris to read this poem!
You know what the dead poets would say: Gather ye rosebuds while ye may...
If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost.  That is where they should be.  Now put foundations under them.
I will not be disputed in public, do you understand me?
When you've finished medical school and you're on your own, you can do as you please.  Until then, you will listen to me.
Don't you dare talk back to me!  It's bad enough that you've wasted your time with this absurd acting business.  But you deliberately deceived me!  Who put this in your head? How did you expect to get away with it? Answer me!
What is this, a midnight study group?
I've found it.
Neil, you're not gonna...
Todd, what's the matter?
Well, maybe they thought you'd need another one.  Maybe they thought...
I mean, this is one special gift!  Who would want a football or a baseball bat or a car when they could get a desk set as wonderful as this one!
Follow me then to plainer ground.  God, I love this!
Visit from my father.
Right here...middle of nowhere...
Where are my men?
Now, where's Mulligan? Where's Vivo?
You trying to take over my show Finnegan, that what you trying to do?
What other bunch?
Noooo!
But what makes you think there aren't more of those...things...back there?
What's that supposed to mean? You people.
Got it?
Like cattle...
There's not much horsepower left in the engines, but there's enough noise...once this baby's set...I'll rev it up...that slimy bastard will come for it like candy...
Can we use our indoor voice please...
What did you do the my kids!!
It's okay...come on...
Not even a Joey, I'm glad to see you? Joey, what happened to your leg?
You know what I think? I think our luck has just about run shit out...
Where are you going?
She fucked you?
Fucking women, man...
You want 'em?
That's mustard!
Maxie! Hey Maxie wha'd'ya say!
Here. Here we go.  Here's to you, Nick!
Yes, Albert?
Who's going?
Nick's going?
And we want you to know, Sal, that any help you might need--
Ammo! Get the ammo!
What do you think? You think he's been picking flowers? Fuckin' guy's been saving your ass, Albert. Everybody's ass! Even in Europe!
You, Vince! You! You are! You're a crock! You're a walking, talking crock!... I mean, what do you know?
You don't!
I'm tellin' you she does it, Vince! With twenty guys you know!
I got delayed. I --
Nick! Nick, you'll kill him!... Easy. Nick, easy! Hey, hey. Vince goes back a long way.
No, I --
You mean...?
She's in back.
Boy, do I love this conflict. Huh?... What the hell were you doin' in there?
Hey, guys...
Look at that, see... Watch. Wait a minute, watch. There! D'j'u see that? D'j'u see the way he... You know what that guy is doing? That guy is squeezing her ass!
Nick! Hey, Nick!  Boy! Boy oh boy! Are you okay? You're okay, huh?
Not so good.
But Sal's mother! What about Sal's mother!
I thought... Oh, Nick, I thought you were hurt, some accident. Maybe you fell or maybe some car...  I thought someone stole you away!
Fine. I just go along, you know. Down at the market. Back here. I mean it just seems there's a million things to do!... Are you sure you're all right? I mean, what about the wound?
Frost.
Maybe... I don't know, if you want to talk --
Does this... I mean, how does this job work out?
No-o-o!
Nick?
You have to think about this, Sal. Listen to me, Sal! You have to think about this.
Humper's ready. Old humper's hotter'n damn hell!
Who's a yo-yo...? Who do you think's a yo-yo! They're all yo yo's. I mean they're all great guys, for Christ's sake, but... The point is, Nick, without you I'd hunt alone. Seriously. I would. That's what I'd do.
Pow?
I'm telling you, Nick, no one's going to come.
Forget Sal.
How many bullets?
No. No way!
I'll betcha! That's bullshit and I'll betcha! You're fulla shit!
Here, here! This is it!
Sure I got boots. I got boots right here.
No.
What's that noise?
Great. Hey. That's great.
Did you get one?
Where?
Maybe you could use socks, Nick. Jesus, I mean, come to think of it socks are pretty expensive now.
I saw him last night. I thought I was dreaming. I thought I was out of my mind.
Yeah.
It's okay. Hey, it's okay! Just a week. Just to see Phantom Mary.
I mean, I guess you still think about Nam. Right? I mean --
Oh, Jesus!  You're kiddin'!
Down I would say... What would you say?
Looks like ya gonna take office just in time, Chief.  Things need straightening up in this city.
I think he wants more than your cookies.
Who is it?
My man Dubbs.
I want to ask you a few questions.
You helped set up my partner, Sergeant William Wade.  I want to know who put you up to it.
Looks like you did more than jackoff while I was gone.
I want to see my wife and kid.
Don't threaten me.  I tend to take these things seriously.  And get a couple hours sleep.  You look like day old shit.
I'm wasting time.
Wade's in Cryo-Prison.
What do you mean he's escaped?! They're not supposed to escape!
You okay?
I drive.
I'm ready.
Why?
You're saying you were put away for a crime you didn't commit?
Yeah.
Good night, Wade.
I'll have a cup of coffee?
No.  Talk English.  Then I'll understand.
Yeah.
What is it?  Your legs?  Hands?
You startin' a fan club or some- thin'?
But he was such a good cop.
You all right?
You could always take it off.
Let's dance together -- Belle.
Golly, Belle, that was a good idea -- we should do that every morning.
Hey, you! Watch out there -- you're scuffing my Brussels carpet -- Consarn them.
Who are these people?
You're lying.
You think you're so smart, Mrs. Stone. You wanted to be near Jabez. It looked like your big chance tonight, but you're wrong, you can't win him back -- not that way.
Gee -- that Fair --
I think I'd like to begin with the fire-eater --
Make them go faster, Mr.... ?
But it didn't stop. I know it didn't stop. Granny told me it didn't.
Mama!
Kin you spare a moment for me Jabez?
Loan shark -- hey?
Sure does. But I'll have to sleep on it a couple of nights.
What do you want?
Jabez -- will you join our Grange now?
Yes, I wanted to get here before the others.... I want to talk to you alone.
Good evening -- I'm sorry, Jabez -- I'm a little late.
Why do you fret about something that isn't there?
Yes, indeed. But not now. Not for seven years. Oh, I almost forgot -- what is the date?
Are they all as -- small -- as that?
Here's a man who knows what's good for Dan'l Webster! Medford rum! Ah, a breath of the Promised Land!  To the champion of the Iron Horseshoe, Jabez Stone!
I'm sorry you can't see that, I know you could once -- you made a little speech once, that I'll always remember and I know the others do too --  They remember and they see how you have changed. That's why they didn't want to come tonight to you, Jabez -- you're as blind as a Burma bat, with your gold pot! Mind you, it's not the money, I've been talking about, it's what you make of it.
Ahem -- we want to have a little confidential talk with you, Neighbor Stone. Don't like to take a man away from his planting -- but sometimes --
Oh!
And so, Jabez Stone, in the name of the Whig Party of Cross Corners, we offer you the nomination of that party for Selectman.
But -- I was just lucky.
Yes.
You keep that -- that's for you. I want you to talk up the party to make sure that the best folks really come.
Jabez -- help!
Down, Shep! Down!
" ... and if the final vote shall leave thousands of our fellow citizens and their families in hopeless distress, can we -- members of the Government -- go to our beds with a clear conscience, can we, without self- reproach, supplicate the Almighty Mercy to forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors?
Yes -- I had to pay the vet in full. He just wouldn't have treated the horse this time. After all, we can't very well do without a horse.
I'll get the doctor.
Mary -- what would you do?
What do you think of that, Jabez?
I'm serious.
Well -- that's the last time -- we'll have servants to do it.
Mary --
My fault? ... Oh, Jabez -- all I want is to be proud of him. He can be such a fine boy, if we show him how to be.
Mr. Webster ... Wait! ...  Mary!
Jabez! What kind of talk is that for the Sabbath? And me a-reading the holy word!
Now, Jabez Stone -- as for what you're calling hard luck -- well, we made New England out of it. That and codfish.
How'd you know to have the calf ready, Ma?
Yes -- and you figgered right, consarn it!
Hush up such talk, Jabez!
Most outlandish thing I ever heard tell.  Don't seem right, somehow!
Money -- money's a funny thing, ain't it, Ma?
You go down and see what's keeping Dorothy.
My son ... what's the matter?
Ma -- Ma -- it's all right, Ma!
Yep -- you can't get around that mortgage. -- I'm sorry, Jabez.
Wish I could really do something for you. But you know Stevens. He'll throw you off your farm tomorrow if you don't pay him tonight.
Hello, Sheriff.
Fox hunting -- a Stone going fox hunting on a week day -- and the earth crying out for the touch of him!
Well, Martin, I only wear them in Washington -- that's the trouble. But if you ever come down there, I'll show them to you.
It is.
Well -- she hardly ever comes here -- she's not the type of woman who cares to live in the country. Yes -- I'm all on my own -- sometimes it makes you feel a little lonely --  Do you mind if I indulge?
You don't have to defend him to me, Mary -- I've been called names myself.
Mr. Webster -- you will help him?
Hey there, Dan'l! Black Dan'l!
Someone to see you, Dan'l!
It's only a short drive, Mr. Webster.
Say, that's pretty good, young man.
That isn't it. It's ... the loneliness, Mr. Scratch ... the loneliness!
I want someone to talk to ...
No, no ...  I want to talk to men ... to people in Cross Corners ...to my neighbors ...
I can't be honest with them.
Argyle.  Don't you take this stuff?
The girl was off today.  Hey, I didn't expect you to sit up front.  So, your lady live out here?
Closer to Japan.  You're fast.
'Cause I'm a New York cop who used to be a New York kid, and I got six months backlog of New York scumbags I'm still trying to put behind bars. I don't just get up and move.
Like I said, Argyle...you're fast.
You're all right, Argyle.
One of yours?
What's happening?
What are you going to do?
What am I, a method actor?  Hans, babe, put away the gun.  This is radio, not television...
-- you wouldn't let me kill him when I had the chance --
The code key, please...?
Mr. Mystery Guest.  Are you still there?
You...you don't work for Nakatomi... and if you're not one of them...
Better than being caught with your pants down, right?  John McClane.
Hans.  Your Hans.
Nein, dies ein ist mein.  This time John Wayne does not walk off into the sunset with Grace Kelly.
...the circuits that cannot be cut... are cut automatically in reponse to a terrorist incident...You ask for miracles, Theo...I give you the FBI...
I...have a request.
After all your posturing, all your speeches...you're nothing but a common thief.
Didn't we have this same conversation in July?  Damn it, John, there was an opportunity out here -- I had to take it --
Relax, Ellis.  I'm off duty.
I hear you...  Partner.  And LA's finest are on it, so light 'em if you got 'em.
I'm here, Roy, but I'm, uh, kind of busy.  Let's talk later, okay?
Al?  Al, you there?
Eleven years ago.  Oh, it was dark... he was big for his age...damn ray gun he had looked real enough...yeah, I had all the right excuses...but afterwards... I really couldn't draw my gun again.
Powell?  What's going on?
Look...I'm getting a bad feeling up here...I'd like you to do something for me.  Look up my wife...don't ask how, you'll know by then...and tell her...tell her...I've been a jerk. When things panned out for her, I should've been behind her all the way ...We had something great going until I screwed it up...She was the best thing that ever happened to a bum like me.  She's heard me say I love you a thousand times, but she never got to hear this...honey...I'm sorry.  You get all that?
I don't think so, Sir.  In fact... I think he's a cop.  Maybe not LAPD, but definitely a badge.
What about the body that fell out of the window -- ?
Is that him?
This is --
Whattaya think: we gonna kill any civilians tonight, Gene?
If you're right I'm gonna back you a hundred percent, you know that.
I was lookin' at it.  I saw you, man!  Jesus!  You oughta see yourself!  You wouldn't believe it.
Hey, Sonny!  I'm watchin' it on TV!
Sonny, I'm gettin' real bad vibes.
Hey, don't take the car!
I'll kiss the baby for you.
No.  Look, we're kind of....
Yeah.  You said... I thought you were never getting out?
So... that sure is something.
Fine, thank you.  I'm in trouble. That is... now I am!
I know!
Huh ... I don't know.  They got Howard Johnson's there.  I don't know why the fuck I'm going there for.
Denmark?  Sweden?
Would you do something for me? Please?
No!  They're standing all around me. Seven thousand fucken cops... all around me.
Yeah... I knew it.  But, what choice do I have?  I'm in the hospital; they drag me out of the hospital... bring me down here...
Yeah... yeah!
Yeah... huh, thank you.  I'm going to go back, Sonny, to the hospital. They're really nice people.  They're really trying to help me.
Well... I don't know if I have or not.
It's my only chance!
He's got eight people in there with him.  He's got this kid with him ... they're gonna shoot the people.
If he won't listen to you, who will he listen to?
Somebody's got to stop him, Leon.
He needed money?  For the operation for you?
Okay, you're in there and we're out here.  What do we do now?
You alone, or you got confederates?
Give me a name, any name, just so I got somethin' to call you.
Okay, Sonny, I want to see if the people in the bank are okay, then what I want to do is work out a way to get them out of there.  I want to come over there, without a gun ... and you can frisk me.  So you can see you can trust me.  So we can talk and find a way outta this mess.
You want me to give up, huh?  Look, Sal's in back with the girls. Anything happens to me - one move - and Sal gives it to them.  Boom boom.  How do I know you won't jump me?
Let Sal come out, take a look. What hope you got?  Quit while you're ahead.  All you got is attempted robbery.
The girl hostages.
You're full of shit ...
You know, you're telling me that a helicopter can't land here ...
Don't fuck with me ...
We're all set at Kennedy.
Hey... let him out!
Now, you -- what's your name?
You got kids?
Are we going to get the ball rolling?
You tell me.  Is he endangering his health, because if you tell me he is, I'll get him out.
I'll never see them again, Mister Mulvaney.
Yeah.
You all right?
I wish somebody would tell me I'm gonna live long enough for it to be a habit.  My parent, she'll be okay. My husband, he'll be okay.  I even know who the bum is gonna marry. Terrific.  She'll take good care of him.
You're really pure, you know?  You got a perfect record.  You never used that stuff to ruin your body, why start now?
Hey, for christ's sake... now... fuckin' asshole...  He can't make it.
Ah, Jesus...
Goddamn women...
Well, I stalled him for a while. When it comes the time, then we'll work it out.  Okay?
I want him to think that.
I figure maybe we can get the FBI to make a deal ...
I never been up in a plane before.
Okay ... okay ... all right, Sal, it's okay.  I got everything straightened out ... it's gonna be okay.
What?
Sal?
Hey, Sal ... How you doin'?
Just give me a receipt.  Hey, Sal, you okay?
Aw, Jesus ... you been doin' us favors all night!
Okay - you got your one.
Okay, who's the head teller here?
Oh, shit!  I gotta have time to think.
Here's your document, Sonny.
Fuck!  We did it!
What do you want here, Ma?  You could of watched it on TV.
Mom - I got it all worked out; it's over.  The best thing is you go home.  Watch it on TV.
Oh my God, mother!
Not now, Mom, please.
I'm a fuckup and an outcast.  There isn't one single person in my life I haven't hurt through my love. You understand that?  I'm the most dangerous person in the world, because if I love you, watch out, you're gonna get fucked, fucked over and fucked out!
Did Pop come down?
Why are you doing this?
This is Drake Bishop.
This is Bishop.
Where are we going?
Will you speak the fucking English language? The poor girl has no clue what you're talking about.  The boy speaks English, you know. Reads, writes, I swear it. He does this when he's around girls. Thinks it's cute.
Jesus Christ! What's that smell?
Oh! And another thing. I am a liar. A pathological liar. There was no day in Danang, no multiple tours in Nam. Just lies to get laid, lies to get respect.  Truth is... I'm scared shitless all the time.
Promise me... you won't ever tell Domino.
We need hostages. Celebrity hostages. Just in case this gets ugly. <b> EXT. NEVADA DESERT -- LATER ON </b> The Cast Winnebago drives through the desert.
<i>The driver's name was Locus Fender. We know that he was in on the heist.</i> <b> INT. ARMORED CAR -- NEXT </b> LOCUS FENDER  is behind the wheel of the armored car. His unshaven, disheveled appearance looks totally out of place in his security uniform. <b> INT. VEGAS SECURITY LOCKDOWN -- NIGHT </b> Taryn is now scrawling notes on a pad.
Is it true that you were hired to track down and capture the thieves... and then deliver them to Drake Bishop... owner of the Stratosphere Hotel & Casino?
You then learned where the thieves had hidden the money... and at the instructions of your employer went to retrieve it yourself.
He's a reality television producer. His name is Mark Weiss.
Take us to Vegas. <b> EXT. DESERT ROAD -- DAY </b> The crew rides in the back of the Wanderer's truck toward Vegas. <b> INT. VEGAS SECURITY LOCKDOWN -- NIGHT </b> Domino stares at Taryn as she returns to the table.
HE'S STILL ALIVE, EDNA!

Really? Did you play in a band?

They need to get the introduction on camera. Just play along, alright?
Where is Domino?
Just like Billy Ocean says. <i>When the going gets tough...</i>
Yeah, I know dat motherfucker.
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout. That's what I'm talkin' 'bout.
Buggin' Out, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but you can really direct your energies in a more useful way.
What did I tell ya 'bout dat noise?
Mookie.
How long?
No!
That was a foolish act, but it was brave.  That chile owes you his life.
I thank you.
My name is Eddie.
Fifty cents.
Good!  Leave me alone when I'm sleeping.  I'm gonna get a lock on my door, to keep ya ass outta here.
Jade.
How come you're not at Sal's?
Yeah, then ya should take better care of your responsibilities.
No, you're tripping.  Don't come in Sal's.  Alright, read my lips.
Nice!
You should see the way he looks at you.  All Sal wants to do is hide the salami.
...peanuts.
Jade, you're late.
I'll do.
You are too cruel to Da Mayor, it isn't right.
D, not C.
How many you say?
WAKE UP!
It's a fucking shame.
Sweet Dick Willie.
Let it be broke.
I didn't say nobody, I said you.
Mookie, no cursing in the store.
Mookie, get offa da phone.
I would like to get paid now.
Sal, if you want me to deliver any faster, get me a jet rocket or something, cuz I can't run with pizzas, all the cheese ends up on one side and shit.
Whatdafuck do you want?
How much?  How much do I owe you?
I know I haven't seen you in four days.  I'm a working man.
Alright.  Alright.  I'll be over there sometime today.
That's out.  No!  It's too hot! You think I'm gonna let you get some, put on your clothes, then run outta here and never see you again in who knows when?
It's cold.
What?
Mookie, you must think I'm stupid or something.  You're gonna run outta here and I won't see your black ass for another week.
You don't care about me and you definately don't care 'bout your son.
You deaf or what?
I don't know.
Pino, no joke.  C'mon, answer.
That's the dope.
I'm listening.
Me and you are gonna have a talk.
Jesus Christ on the cross, I said I'm listening.
How do you know this?
You really think so?
Can you do better?  I didn't think so.  This is a respectable business.  Nuthin' wrong with it.  Get dat broom.
Pino, relax, will ya.
I should have Vito go with you all the time.
Sal's Famous Pizzeria, yeah, two large pizzas, pepperoni and anchovies, hold on...  See, Pop, Mookie fucking talking on the phone and people are trying to call in orders.  He's making us lose business.
I didn't think so.
You're gonna be in the street with the rest of your homeboys.
Pop asked you.
Both of youse--shaddup.  This is a place of business.
Pop, I'm gonna go with Mookie.
No, I'm not it.
Yeah, well, I'd much rather write an expose or a hard hitting investigative piece, but nothing really ever happens around here. But, I chose you and that's fine.  I'm Jessica Matthews.
Hey guys.
That's because Ms. Heller doesn't want you to know this whole thing is a scam.
Excuse me?
Okay, there's a lot for us to go over, so it may get hard for you.
Sit down, I have something to tell you.
What? Well now I'm in a position where I may just heed your help.
Just down the hall.
Why didn't you tell us your boyfriend was Principal Collins?
Hey look, it's our teacher.
You're going to be just fine, HARRY.
Here's your lunch. And an apple and banana for extra energy.
Oh, Harry, I'm so proud of you making a real friend.
No, it's a treasure map.
What?
No no no no no.
God, she's beautiful. My wiener's all tingly.
No, I just usually eat my lunch on the crapper. Saves time. Out with the old, in with the new.
Oh, yeah. Well I almost always beat Captain Rob.
Yeah, go-cart accident.
I can't help my heart. And when I'm your dad, you'll have to do as I say.
HARRY.
No.
You're it.
There she goes, now wearing nothing but her underwear.
How do you know it's for us?
Well... Uh...maybe... jeez, how can I say this... you and I could...perhaps ...maybe...uh... partner up?
Oh hey Lloyd, why are you here?
HARRY! I found the treasure!
If you have to ask, you don't know.
Hey, look. Ice cream.
But my mom gave me the map.
Oh, good. There's Jessica.
Hey there goes Principal Collins!
Hold up. First, we have to decide who gets who, remember? No more competition?
The one on the left.
Sorry, Charlie.
Why are you teaching Special Needs? You're the lunch lady.
Well, what have we here? It appears be a tape.
TURK, what are you doing here?
Being a jerk doesn't make you special.
What?
HARRY and I have been talking about school. In fact, I want to ask you something.
Oh, baby, you're the bestest.
Don't worry about me, I'll be fine. I can take care of myself and I'm getting the story every high school reporter dreams of.
Well I need to get a job and you're telling me that if I join up - I can really come and go whenever I want?
Well he missed a great pot of stew!
What are you crazy kids doing in my tool shed?
Ha! Too big to make the turn!
I think you did it.
No. No. That's not it. We don't kill him. We don't kill anybody. But I like the way you're thinking. You're focused and you're trying to follow. No, what we need to do is start a fake Special Needs class.
Guess what"s under these coconuts.
Baby, I'm going to spend the morning at the mall. You know, shop for Waikiki. Honey, what are you looking for?
Wait a minute, I think I know who stole it.
Are you going to kill her?
So the chest is still out there somewhere.
My Lord!
It was Feyd?  It was Feyd!  Where is the ducal signet ring?  I must have his ring.
Yes?
Can you hear me?... If this visit has anything to do with spice... -- The Guild Navigator shudders and swishes quite violently in his tank.
Dust cloud ahead, Sire.
Not in the mood?! Mood's a thing for cattle and love play... not fighting.
What's gotten into Gurney? He's not faking. Paul presses forward and the fight moves quickly around the room. The smell of ozone grows stronger as the shields hit and SPARK off one another. Paul directs a parry downwards, turns, and leads Gurney against the table, plunging at just the right moment to pin Gurney against the table top with his blade right at Gurney's neck.
Things have been so serious here lately.
Don't you trust your own eyes.
Paul, this is the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam. She is going to... observe you...  Please... -- REVEREND MOTHER Jessica, you know it must be done. I enjoin you to stand guard at the door and practice the meditation of peace.
He knows.
Cinnamon... the spice!  Do you smell it?
Are you a Fremen?
Will we see a worm?
Always?
Why do they come?
Water on Arrakis!!! I have seen this place in a dream.  A treasure.
We surprised a band of smugglers.
Long live the fighters!
It burns.
I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear... I will permit it to pass over me and through me. -- The Reverend Mother moves her face up to his. Her ancient face with its metal teeth gleaming inches away breathes hotly. She is smiling.
Well he isn't... and he won't die... Tell me he won't die!
Yes. Perhaps he would at that.
Bring me two more Beefeater martinis. Eddie will have another whiskey, Dagmar's a Rum-and-coke, Moustapha and King are chablis -- hey Bela, would you like a wine?
Who are you?  What do you want?
Why were you buying a coffin?
Oh, there's my bus.  Shit, where's my transfer?!
I am getting tired.  I need to take my medicine.
Are you sure this is okay?
You're right, Bela.  Now Dracula, <u>that's</u> a part that takes acting.
Look, you seem a little agitated. Do you maybe wanna take a little break, go for a nice walk... and then we'll come back and shoot the scene?
But we need to start off with a bang! Something we <u>know</u> the audience will want to see.  Mmm.  What was your biggest hit?
Ha-ha!  Dr. Acula!
"It is my home."
Goodbye!  Goodbye!
It was a very impressive offer. Fancy offices, a big home... I'd be treated like a king.
Out <u>there</u>?!  What happened to the stream?
Goddamn, it's cold!
Do you know I turned down "Frankenstein"?
Bela, I've got twenty-five scenes to shoot tonight.
What happened?!
I envied him.  Hell, I envied you too, having a girlfriend that would jump in front of a car like that.
So guess where I'm going next weekend?
Jesus!  Are you serious?
I've never seen anything like him!
Which one <u>is</u> the red one?
Edward Wood, Sir.
I don't understand.
Bravo!  Bravo!  Magnifico!
We thought Mr. Lugosi was insured though the Screen Actors Guild.
Dolores, give me your shoes.
Huh?!  Oh, uh, no, I didn't get the job. But something <u>better</u> happened!
And what about this so-called "Barbara" character?  It's obviously ME!  I'm so embarrassed!  This is <u>our</u> <u>life</u>!
Ed, who is Daniel Davis?
Who cares?!  We're on a ROLL!  These are the moments in life you're supposed to grab.
Don't get angry at me.  Maybe you just need a day job.
Look, how many times can I say I'm sorry?  I blew it!  I thought she was rich.
I'm going to my mother's.
Dolores, wait!
So my associate Mr. Marco tells me you may be interested in investing in a motion picture.
Yeah.  Well I need the other sixty-thousand.
The other sixty-thousand you said you'd give me.
Yeah?  Well now he's a junkie.  He don't deserve to work.
He's so great, <u>you</u> hire him.
Screen Classics?  Hmm, don't know them.
Oh, "Dr. Acula."  I get it.  I don't like it.
Well... I've got another project I wasn't gonna tell you about. Lugosi's in it, but he's got a smaller part.  The lead is an ingenue, a sterling young actress named Dolores Fuller.  The title is "Bride Of The Atom."
Yeah...?
"Graverobbers From Outer Space"! It's <u>money in the bank</u>.
Tor.  Have you ever thought about becoming an actor?
Well, I think you'd be a sensation in pictures.
No.  She tink Lobo is waste of my time.  Lobo don't talk.
Tor, I should be getting home.
What is happening?
Ain't that the truth!  I've even bad producers recut my movies --
Mr. Welles, is it all worth it?
Yeah, well a couple of things have changed.  It ain't gonna be the Christine Jorgensen story no more. Goddamn "Variety" printed the story before I had the rights, and now that bitch is asking for the sky.
Is there a script?
It opens in nine weeks in Tulsa.
Well, Mr. Weiss, I've never told anyone what I'm about to tell you... but I really want this job.  I like to dress in women's clothing.
No, no, not at all!  I <u>love</u> women. Wearing their clothes makes me feel closer to them.
And this is why you think you're the most qualified to make my movie?
And what's with this new title?!  My poster says "I CHANGED MY SEX"!
<u>Then how's it gonna get in the</u> <u>picture</u>?!
How long's he been here?
You're not gonna believe the first picture I ever saw.  Your friend's.
Oh.  Okay.
What was that?
I might as well be.  I made shitty movies that nobody wanted to see.  I blew it.  All he wanted was a comeback... that last glory...
You know, when you rewrite a script, it just gets better and better!
You should feel lucky.  Ed's the only guy in town who doesn't pass judgment on people.
I can't get it to go up.
Huh?!
I don't understand.  Do you want my autograph?
You want me to show it on my TV program?  Well I got nothing to do with that.  You should call up the station manager at Channel Seven --
Look... would it be possible to make the "Ghoul's Wife" a little less prominent, so people won't really notice me in the movie?
<u>It's uncanny</u>.
Ed, you said you were getting permission.
Hey.  This is looking good!  Paul, where's the octopus motor?
Too tall... too short...  And this guy doesn't work at all.
...Do you accept the Lord Jesus Christ as your savior?
Isn't it wonderful?  Bela lives!
Wow.
Yeah. I brought you some movies.
Have I ever said a bad word to you about your father?
Our neighbors gave me a ride.
Did you see that?
Her. That look. She likes the Ed guy better than she likes the brother.
I'11 tell you something else. The old guy in the wheelchair? The stepfather? They're gonna have him die.
Yes, Ed.
Leave her be.
Ed --
Ed --
Isn't this getting kind of pathetic. I mean we drank the juice, now we're just licking peel. Let it go!
Mr. Pekurny.

You know who we are?
Hey, if it's free, it's me.  You ready?
Yeah, a thing. He became a big hero. He was on TV and there was a parade and a movie about him
No.
How's Marcia? She all right?
He... apologized, he begged me. He can be very... charming when it suits his purpose.
What happened?
What?
Oh my god! On TV!
Don't tell Al. He doesn't know.
Why shouldn't I be in a place like this? I'm a whore!
She left. She moved. She got Fed-Ex to give her a transfer and she left. She couldn't stand it anymore. We had people, news people, regular people, just sleeping in our hallway, going through our mail, our garbage. I mean it was she couldn't take it anymore. Now I've got to move. I can't afford this place by myself.
Look, if you don't let me out of this... I'11 just... I'11 just sit in my apartment all day. I won't go anywhere, I won't do anything. What kind of show will that be?
Hey, Lou.
Yeah...
Are you sure about this?
So?
Really?
Me too. I mean I'm going out with Ray and I'm... thinking about you.
Sunday night at the Devils game, I'm driving the Zamboni.
You know, the big machine that cleans the ice.
Oh -- Sunday is good for me to meet your folks. We get a big family audience on Sundays so it works out.
So...?
A poll. "Is Shari Good Enough for Ed?" Seventy-one per cent said "no."  They hate me!
I'm sorry.
Where?
Okay.
I need to talk.
Oh that was... no, I ... she just kind of trapped me into giving her a ride. It's you. I want you.
Ray borrowed this whole tub of money against this balloon payment that I don't get if I qu -- it's too complicated. I -- Besides...
My truck overheated, so I opened the hood and my hair got caught in the fan belt. So I had to get a haircut.
Let's have a contest. Now this would mostly be open to professional investigators and detectives. But anyone can join in.
But facts! They have to be verified. Anything from their past, their present, business, personal -- arrests, affairs ... And whoever comes up with the sleaziest, most degrading material -- I'11 give you ten thousand dollars. And you get to be on Ed TV.  Hah?
That! Being that guy. Being the guy they watch.
Whenever you ask me something why do you always say "Let me ask you something?" Why don't you just ask me?
Richie!  She spent six months dating a criminal
What are you, hiding from the Police?  Show your face, you look great.  Doesn't she look great.
Who is it?
Hi.
What is this? What's going on, who is that?
Next thing you know! Why didn't you stop?
Why me?
You know what your problem is?
And each contestant gets one of these.  An "I tried to screw a network executive" tee-shirt.
Who is it?
I was in jail.
The last two years, I've been a limousine driver, but I don't see well anymore, so...
Yeah? That's good. Sorry is good. You know I finished that model.
-- That we were doing "together." I finished it. It came out great! Because no one was standing over my shoulder bothering me - "That's too much glue. You're using too much glue."
That girl's an idiot.
Hi.
Look, my life is not so great, that I want it shown on television. And neither is yours.
But you haven't written your novel.
Sherry   Sherry  Sheerrry. ...
How'd it go?
What?
Larry?
Larry? We've got twenty-five minutes until the assembly, and we still have to do counts for VP, Treasurer and Secretary. Mr. Hendricks and I have both verified the numbers, and unless you can come up with the ballots you claim are missing -
You know what they say about the early bird.
Well, good luck there, Tracy
Now at the end of her junior year, Tracy was poised to win the presidency of the student body.  And so far she was running unopposed.
Are you sure all her signatures are real?  It's not easy to get all those signatures.
This isn't the time or the place to get into it, but there is, for just one example, a certain former colleague of mine, who made a very big mistake, a life mistake.  I think the lesson there is that, old and young, we ail make mistakes, and we have to learn that our actions, all of them, can carry serious consequences.  You're very young, Tracy underage, in fact -- but maybe one day you'll understand.
Hello, Mr. M.
Huh.  Right.  College.  Wow.  Where are you going?  Where 'd you get into?
Where to?
And this model comes with ABS and dual air bags standard.
So Tracy?
Why are you doing this?
Coming to see me.  Are you trying to. . humiliate me?
What's this?
I want you to do something for me.
Oh, is this...?  God. First one of these I haven't been in for a long time.
What a surprise.
I hope so
That little bitch made a fool of us I want her out of the election. Getting everybody all riled up like that.  She's finished, you hear me? Washed up.
Life would go on, and I would certainly be a stronger and wiser person from the experience.
Walt will be speaking with you about this, but I need you to find someone to take over my classes. The lesson plans for the rest of the year are in my top right drawer.
You wanted to see me, Mr. M.?
Looks at her skeptically  doesn't say a word.
More this way.
Shall we give it a name?
Did you know Dave's a bed wetter?
All his life.  He's tried everything.
Yep.
I was lonely.  You took advantage
I know.  I understand disappointment. I really do.
Who, me?  Nooo.  I never... I don't know anything about that stuff, Mr. M. Besides, that's Tracy Flick's thing. She's always working so hard and --
You said I was a liar   You're the liar, you're the --
Where 're you going?
What...?
These are private -- these are for us.
She's doing this to get back at me
Who put you up to this?
So Mr. McAllister asked you to run.
Hell, good luck!
Yeah.
Hey, Tammy, guess what happened today.
Yeah.  So guess what happened.  So Mr. McAllister, he --  Oh hi. Lisa.
What do you want?
How's the left these days?
I saw you fight Kid Gavilan.  I like your style.
I was friendly with Sue Lefferts, but we weren't really friends. You know what I mean?
Yeah I know.  Patchett's running whores and judging by his address, probably something bigger on the side.  He doesn't want any attention.
Do you enjoy it?
Actually, it was two.  You're different, Officer White.  You're the first man in five years who didn't tell me I look like Veronica Lake inside of a minute.
Look.  I want to see you again.
It doesn't matter.  All they get is Veronica Lake.  You got the real Lynn Margaret Bracken...  Where'd this come from?
So you saved her.
Come in out of the rain, Bud.
We talked.
Yeah, I hate them.
What's going to happen to Stensland?  He'll give himself cirrhosis over this.  <u>He's one</u> <u>year from his pension</u>.
You lost me, Dudley.  I don't know what you're talking about.
Susie, I told you I didn't approve of that boyfriend.  He was too old for you.  You let him come into this house and be fresh to me.  I went out one day and old Mrs. Jensen next door saw Susan's boyfriend and another man and thought she heard a ruckus.
Maybe.  I don't know.
Was it... a rat?
A naked guy with a gun?  You expect anyone to believe that?
How's it going to look on your report?
Dudley's guys.
You expecting problems?
It's a suicide note.  Says he killed Jack because Jack had figured out a pornography scam Patchett was running.
We had one thing figured wrong.  I don't think Dudley workd for Patchett.
They never made a match on the shotgun serial numbers.  What if Breuning and Carlisle took them from the evidence room?  Couple of cold pieces that had been hanging around a year or two.
You wanted to meet here?
Where's the other guy?  Buzz.
You wanna go downtown and discuss this officially?
Officer White.  I heard you got a hard-on for wife beaters.
Should I?
Bud White, what brings you down to the basement?
What do you want to know?
If she was sitting here, then it's facing the wrong way.  What are these smears in the blood?
Ed, your observations have been astute.  What's your assessment of this situation?
Where are the police academy files?
Ray, you protected Ty and Larry up in Casitas, didn't you?
I don't want a floor plan; I want to know who!  Who's taking the ticket for this, Johnny?
This is Mr. Hudgeons, Wendell.
Okay so we worked together.  It was an information exchange.  I got him first class collars and he got me good stories.  We were friends for Chrissakes!
You'll reap the benefits, but are you truly prepared to be despised within the department?
Sir, I took the call.  It's my case.
Don't get sidetracked.  Stay with the Nite Owl.
Damnit...
Transfer me, suspend me.  Just leave me alone.
Is there more to that, or do I have to guess?
Okay, college boy, I'll help you. But I want half the collar.
Movie star hookers.  Whatever you desire... It's Fleur-fr-Lis again.
I'll tell you what I told Officer White when he asked me about Susan's death.
Really?  What did White say?
How about White?
Does all that make it harder for you to hate him or easier?
You don't like that you don't know how to play him.  He doesn't follow the same rules of politics you do.  That makes him dangerous.
If I knew you were coming I'd have baked a cake.
On what evidence?
Do you have any proof?
Okay!  You're right!  Dudley's got photos of me and Reynolds.
It seems like my Susan, but...
That other policeman already checked under the house and found not a thing amiss.
Big V Jack Vincennes!  May I have this dance?
We did a piece last year. 'Ingenue Dykes In Hollywood.'  Her name got mentioned.
Contract players at Metro.  You pinch 'em.  I do you up feature in the next issue.  Plus the usual fifty cash.  Tell me, am I fucking Santa Claus?
They're sitting in the dark, goofing on the Christmas tree.
It's Christmas morning in the City of Angels, and while decent citizens sleep the sleep of the righteous, hopheads prowl for marijuana, not knowing that a man is coming to stop them.  The free- wheeling, big-time Big V, celebrity crime-stopper, Jack Vincennes, the scourge of grasshoppers and junk fiends everywhere.  You like it, Jackie- Boy?
<u>Hush-Hush</u>.  Off the record and on the Q.T.
Shut up!
Loew didn't go with him.  You're sure?
Please hold the line... No such number is assigned.
Fleaur-de-Lis.  'Whatever you desire.'
Working whores with squad two.
Brill?
What'd he say to you?
Don't bullshit me, I can save your life.
Um...who's that?
209 to anyone! I need some help here!
Lemme ask you something. I put a bird feeder out in the yard, but the squirrels, they keep taking--
Alright, I made a joke about squirrels, don't get so--
You've got it on tape?
No one. But I'm a little nervous.
It is?
Why don't you just call Brill directly.
One of many people who would live a word with you.
Why don't they just identify themselves and tell me what they want?
What if--
I'll pay you.
How many years have <u>you</u> been hiding from them? How many years have you been running?  What'd they do to you?
I taped it off the 11 o'clock news.
I was worried about my hundred and twenty 'K'.
Did you call anyone?
None of your business.
They can tap anything as along as it's an airwave intercept. Cellulars and pagers your kid can do.  Hard-line calls we'd pick off the relays as they were being fed into ground cables or fired up to the SATs. We'd suck in everything. All foreign, most domestic.  Domestic was my group. Druggies, radicals, loud-mouths. Anyone we wanted.
That was twenty years ago. With digital? They can suck a salt grain off a beach.
Remember when Senator Hamersley died in an accident up near Shenandoah?
Here?
In the warehouse. They're hiding in a duct on the third floor. When we go back inside, they're gonna kill us. When they notice that we're moving toward the car, they'll come running out of the building.
What the fuck?!
We lost 'em.
Drive.
What if <u>what</u>?
Reynolds.
We're gonna lead Albert by the nose to one conclusion. And then when he's pissed as hell, we're gonna drop the tape in his lap. How fast can you teach me what I need to know?
What do you know about locking cellular phone signals?
Baudmore Consultants.
Most of this stuff's only available to law enforcement.
I yanked this off your RV. It's a Global Positioning Tracker.
Hi, Mr. Dean.
Is it okay?
What size?
I'll be right back.
Because my life is being ruined.
Mr. Zavitz was in trouble.
Was he with anyone?
For your wife?
Bobby!
So you tap everyone's phone? You use computers to probe financial records? New Search and Seizure laws?
We won't suspend the civil rights of the good people.
What do you mean?
He's got his priorities?
Stacy?
I've seen it.
I think you should leave now, Robert.
Stacy--
Stacy, somebody's trying to kill me. Now goddamit--
Is Eric in school?
Has anyone been by? Police? FBI?
Good.
The lingerie.
They're saying you killed that policeman.
I'm sorry, sir, this card's been declined.
My suitcase--
You don't know who the fuck--
DePinto?
Never.
Why would I--
I got a call from my firm this morning saying don't come in.
I gotta go.
That's temporary.
This conversation's over.
Otherwise you may have to what?
Listen--
Gentlemen--
Who would do that?
I'm sorry, Mr. Dean. But Larry's in St. Lukes now, so I'm a little--I'm not myself. The Union bosses say unless we take Bellmoth's offer, it'll only get worse.
Because they've been paid off by Bellmoth.
Are you and mom getting a divorce?
Yeah.
No.
Ssh!
They killed Rachel.
Yeah?
It's been a few years.
Tell me about it.
Dick Burns got a phone call this morning from someone wanting information on you.
No. He said they were doing a credit check. Are you refinancing a loan?
I'm not asking you to say for certain. This is what you're trained to do, right?
It means who's side are you on?
Is that anyway to talk to an old school chum?
The originals?
Am I to understand--
We'd have to--
It was in his bag. Now it's not.
No, no, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were hoping to be transferred to a weathership outside Greenland.
No sir.
And they have the video. That's confirmed.
We think it was on Brill. If it was, it's destroyed now.
We're not stupid, Reynolds.
No thank you.
Isn't Zerzura supposed to be protected by spirits who take on the shape of sandstorms?
You've been cheated, don't worry, we'll take it back.
This is an incredible story - about a man hunting an Ostrich, he's been telling me about Zerzura, he thinks he's been there, but his map, the route he's describing, he couldn't survive the journey now, but he's a poet, so his map is poetry - and now we're onto an Ostrich.  I'm telling her your map is poetry. The Arab shrugs.
What am I looking at?
I'd better get back.  Say goodbye here.
Dance with me.
Don't you know you drove everybody mad?
Oh dear.
Safe journey.
Clifton - your wife - do you think it's appropriate to leave her?
It's Geoffrey under this.
I see.
Do you have your papers, sir?
I understand you are agitated - perhaps you would like to sit down while I radio back to HQ -
You shouldn't go into another man's tent. It's inexcusable.
I was talking about the girl.
Why do they care about our maps?
I believe I'm rather late.
Bermann thinks he'll be interned, poor fellow.  I'm going to do what I can, but  And D'Ag turns out to be a great admirer of Mussolini. So now you can say I told you so.
David Caravaggio.
Petty thief, six months imprisonment Kingston Penitentiary, 1937.
Well, you must know.  You were brought up Libya, yes?
Go!  Hey!  Go! Caravaggio is in terror.
What do you want?
Yeah, for a while.
Thief, I think, is more accurate.
Oh, all over.
I think anybody she ever loves tends to die on her.
Are you outside? A beat and then Caravaggio shuffles in.  Like an old boxer.
Why do I feel if I had your book I would know everything?
First wedding anniversary - what do you call it?
Have a drink.
You get to the morning and the poison leaks away, doesn't it? Black nights, fucking black nights, when you want to howl like a dog. I thought I would kill you.  You killed my friends, you ruined my hands.  But the girl was always here, like some Guardian Angel.
Did Katharine say? - Geoffrey has to fly back to Cairo.
I should try and move your bed.  I want you to be able to see the view.  It's good, it's a view from a monastery.
He's Canadian.
He's going back to the front this evening.  I can't see him otherwise.
No, I can't go, but if it, if you weren't offended, it would be very good of you to allow us - every other cabin is crammed. This is as private as we'll get.
Something smells so rich.  My stomach is heaving -
He wants us to move out, says there could be fifty more mines in the building. He thinks I'm mad because I laughed at him.  He's Indian, he wears a turban.
Arguing about books.
Hana was just telling me that you were indifferent -
I'm still here.
Who knows the Bosphorus Hug?
Excuse me.  Yes?  I don't have the key to that door.
I see.  Then may be you're safe as long as you only play Bach.  He's German. Kip is looking around the piano. Hana giggles.
Why would anyone do this?
What is this business with you and explosives?  Do you think you're immune?
Kip - come and dance with me
If one night I didn't come to the tent, what would you do?
Since Caravaggio turned up - food seems to appear, so please.
Whoa - give me a chance!
I've got a surprise.  A boat!  We can go to Capri.  It's got a cabin, it's private.
I thought that was for when we were very very old?
Hey!  Hey!  Stop!  Hey!
Yessir.
I'm afraid we're not having much luck obtaining funds for the expedition.
Katharine!
Brick platform opposite the old Ajaib-Gher -
What are you talking about?
They're excited!  They're happy about destroying a whole city. Would they do that to a White Man's City?  Never!
You didn't answer the beeper either.
A thief this good could handle the sensors in the rooms. What we don't get is how he effectuated his entry.
So he popped the pane?
Mac's signature.
You're saying the thief wants us to think it's Mac but it's really not.
It's not the thinking of it, it's the doing it.
I've been following this guy for years. I'm your best shot.
In the middle? You've got the Mask, why don't we have him?
A billion people speak Chinese. Don't be too impressed with yourself. As for that scroll, I can resell it for double. In 30 minutes.
I'm sorry about the scroll, but sometimes you have to lose to win.
Like I would have art in my suitcase.
I've got something for you.
And I thought we were getting on so well.
I know.
We going somewhere?
I'm not here to run errands. I'm here for the Mask.
Lose something?
Nothing? You don't even lock the door?
And good morning.
Years ago, if memory serves. When does the exhibit end?
Only a week?
Pack up. I'll see you get back to London.
Someone was expecting that.
I'll need that.
Camera in the--
Popup, on floorboards. And--
We're working.
Be careful not to break the laser beams.
We did it.
What?
Idle hands, the devil's workshop.
Oh my god, I thought--
What about the rules?
Currency data so we can do optimum conversions at the moment of transfer.
What's that?
So how long till we do this?
You're out of your mind. We can't do a job like this with no rehearsal.
Access codes to the vault are changed daily, passwords for our computer on the hour...
But would you--would you--
Four billion dollars.
I'm going to disappear. I die in a car crash in Taiwan. Very easy to do.
Relax, don't jam it...
Always in a rush.
I'm not real big on collecting banged up Ferraris at airports.
I'd give you a hand but it wouldn't look good.
The porta power...comm kits...got the IR/Thermo camera?
I'd say she's a size 6 who wears a size 4.
It's too soon.
Tonight your league night?
Doesn't look like much. How come those Commos want it so bad?
The face decays, the mask doesn't. Art lasts, we don't. That's why art's so valuable. It's a little piece of immortality.
My friend, you always surprise me.
See you.
I added air conditioning, put in the pool, made all those pillows by hand ...
Cause first you gotta move, then there's decorating, and if the windows aren't the same size, you know -- you're making all new curtains.  Honest to God, I don't know if I have the energy.  You know, I've been sick. Me and Peter both have.
So the whole idea of selling the house -- don't get me wrong, I'd be glad to move to some better place, but if they aren't gonna pay us properly, I just don't see the point.
Cause of the chromium.
Well, hell, maybe that's why you all have been so sick --
An on-site monitoring well?  That means --
Well -- then it's gotta be a different than what's in our water, cause ours is okay. The guys from PG&E told me.  They sat right in the kitchen and said it was fine.
Okay -- let's try and settle down here.
I'm sorry about that.  Really.  But --
Okay, look.  If you really want to apply for a job here, you can do it the way everyone else does.  Send in a rÈsumÈ, make an --
Yeah?
All I have is hundreds.
Now, why in the hell would you assume that?
So what made you think it was?
This is the only thing you found?
I'm the one who's injured, and this joker who sits at a desk all day is gonna walk away with almost half my reward?
You think there's more?
This is a whole different ball game, Erin. A much bigger deal.
What now?
Jesus.  They look like the Secret Service.
What kind of truck?
He's gone.  Did you get a license plate?  Or a make?
I was just asking.  Are you all right?
I want my fucking money --
Erin, you're a big girl.  If you got a problem with Jane, work it out for yourself. I don't have time to deal with --
Is that what you want?
... but it won't cover Annabelle Daniels's medical bills.
Plus, 40 percent of 20 million's a whole lot of money.
Counts?
Why good?
She insulted me!
If you tell me to relax, I'm gonna kick your fucking head off --
And if you had to guess ...
Fuck legal terms.  We're talking about human beings here.  Sick people.  A whole bunch of them are gonna be dead in ten years.  They need their money now!  We gotta get 'em to agree to the arbitration, Ed.  We gotta get every damn one of those plaintiffs to --
Why not?
Fuck Kurt.
Ho - ly - shit.
I wasn't gonna --
What is that?
When'd they file the demur?
And you were told to destroy those?
Erin.  Cool.  What can I do for you, Erin?
Well, how do I find out what kind of chromium is up in Hinkley?
I hate it too.  I hate this trip.
PG& -- Are you sure?
Hey, Ros, where are they?
Whose number do you need?
Okay, look -- I think we got off on the wrong foot here --
I had a good neighbor, George.  She was 60 and Mexican and she watched my kids for free.  Something tells me you're not gonna be able to measure up to that.
I'm never here.  I gotta leave 'em with this weird sitter all afternoon who costs a fortune and smells like chicken fat.
I hope that's not supposed to impress me.
This isn't gonna get you laid, you know.
What are you doing here?
You're not nothing, Erin.
If you got a problem with me taking care of your kids instead of getting some job, just say so.
I'm so tired I'm about to drive off the road.  Keep me awake, willya?
I'm bored, and so are the kids.
Hello?
Think you could learn?
No, I need my car --
Promise you'll turn around if you get tired.
-- toothbrush, toothpaste, and a pair of hose.  Here.
Where's my paycheck?
Dr. Paulsen?
Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing.  The Millennium Falcon definitely went into lightspeed. It's probably on the other side of the galaxy by now.
He will learn patience.
He can do it.
He'll learn.
Told you, I did.  Reckless is he ... Now things are going to worse.
Will you?  You underestimate The Emperor.  It is you he wants ... that is why your friends suffer.
How you doing, Chewbacca?  Still wasting your time with this clown, eh?
Barks a blue streak.
Barks a doleful farewell.
We should have stayed and finished them off.
Okay, Chewie, it's now or never.
... Like we're being watched.
Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land here, and if I could get my fighter out of this puddle I would, but I can't.  So ...
No, no!  I'll stay and help you find your friend.
Oh, a Jedi Master.  Different altogether.  Yoda you seek, Yoda.
The night storms will start before you can reach the first marker.
What is thy bidding, My Master?
Captain Solo.  What's the situation?
With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.
Thank you, General.  But there's a price on my head.  If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt, I'm a walking dead man.
Captain Solo, sir. Might I have a word with you?
I don't know, Artoo.  Sir, might I inquire what's going on?
He doesn't make sense to me either, Chewie.
It sounds like it's trying to get in.
I can see the edge of the asteroid field, sir.
Not you?
You probably don't.  How could you?  You're so terrified of your own emotions ...
Spare me please!  Don't tell me about the Rebellion again.  I've had it with your noble mission. All you let yourself think about is the Rebellion.  The result is you're as cold as this planet.
Hey!  Someone's still in here.
Let's hope so ... it's just the chance we need.
They're moving away.
What are you afraid of?
I do not!
Looks like some kind of Mynock.
You could have warned him before you shut him off.
Well, sometimes ... Ah-hah, I knew it!  Lando Calrissian.
Lando's not a system, he's a man. A gambler, con-artist ... all- around scoundrel ...  ... your kind of guy.  The system is called Bespin.  It's a ways from here, but reachable.
You do have your moments ... Not many, but you do have them.
I was worried about you.
About what?
Why you slimy, double-crossing no-good swindler ... am I glad to see you.
That won't be easy, my friend ... What brings you here, anyway?
What about Leia and the Wookiee?
No.
Sorry, am I interrupting anything?
.... We are a free station and do not fall under the jurisdiction of the Empire.
Very noble.  Not smart, but noble.
I knew that set-up was too good to last .... I'm going to miss it.
Ready are you?  What know you of ready?  I have trained Jedi for 800 years.  My own counsel I'll keep on who is to be trained.
I can't. It's too big.
Concentration.  Heh?  Concentration.
That they are.
No, no.  This will not do.  Anger is what you feel.
Ben?  Ben?
I see them! ... They're in pain ... they're suffering.
They're my friends.
All too easy.  Perhaps you are not as strong as The Emperor thought.
The Force runs strong in the Skywalker line.  You will achieve great power ... Come, join with me!  Together we will be the most powerful ... even stronger than The Emperor.
Did you call the Zoo?
Do you have a name?
Zira, are you mad?
To a lot of psychiatric small talk --
With food?
What are they doing here?
We shall want a full autopsy ...
L.A. is in a constant state of warfare. Gangs fighting for the right to rule.
You were injected with glucose. There is no Plutoxin 7 virus. You were never going to die - at least not from anything we gave you.
He doesn't look like his picture.  I bet he's fake.
Ooww!
Come on, Cuervo. I delivered him, didn't I? All I'm asking for is what you promised.
He's... near.
I was called away on urgent business, Snake.
I don't know, sounds thin to me.
I think we've burned off enough fuel. We may be lighter enough to hover. Just barely.
No. The right skid's broken. If I try to set it down she'll crash. I have to stay in a hoverwhile you jump off.  Hey, Carjack. We gotta hide the girl. Give her your dress.
How you doin' Plissken?  You like the watch?
That's right, big shot. Unless you do what we want you're not coming back.
Wait a minute, what are you talkin' about?
Maybe. But you're not putting any shit in me this time.
Get this crap out of me.
Where do I put ashore?
So you want me to take her out?  Is that an order from the President?
By the way - who gives me the anti-toxin?
Plissken...?
It's the President, for Christ's sake!
I said pull over.
Where are they going?
Not yet.
What're you doing in here?
Say, you need anything, Snake? Guns? Explosives? I can get you a crate of hellfire grenades, no problem - five hours.
You ain't doin' so good, Snake. You need help.  You should talk to Hershe. She hates Cuervo. They used to be partners, but they split up.
Who?
Don't follow me.
Be careful of the bald cats. They live in these buildings.
Is he coming?
Not a boast, sir, but a curse.  Never have I met my match in joust or duel.
Sir, your rage has unbalanced you. It seems you would fight to the death against a knight who is not your enemy, for a length of road you can ride around.
Arthur.
Perceval, you have returned!
Whose son am I?
I want to thank you.
It is whispered in the forest that...  ...Leondegrance's castle is under siege by Lot and Uryens.
It's just that I have no experience, and no men to speak of. How can I--
I love her. If she would be my queen, my dreams would be answered.
At your service, sir.
Yes.
With all your powers, you are content to be ridiculed, laughed at...
Me? I have lived by the oath of king and knight.
I have come to claim what is mine, Father.
The very spear that pierced the side of Christ as he died on the cross.
I cannot offer you the land, only my love...
Who is, then?
But I have to leave tomorrow. The forests are thick with rebels, invaders plunder our shores...
I didn't know Leondegrance had a daughter.
Who does it serve?
Why?
Very well. Climb up.
You left your husband's side? You left your brother's wedding?
It's clear you are, and it irks me.
They do.
What do you want? You must desire it for me to weave it.
The oath. You didn't say--
How about Lankaster Merrin.
It's a stylized ritual in which rabbis or priests try to drive out the so-called invading spirit. It's pretty much discarded these days, except by the Catholics who keep it in the closet as a sort of embarrassment. It has worked, in fact, although not for the reason they think, of course. It was purely the force of suggestion. The victim's belief in possession helped cause it; and just in the same way this belief in the power of exorcism can make it disappear.
Just five or six people.
Hello? Yes this is Mrs. MacNeil. Operator you have got to be kidding I have been on this line for twenty minutes.  Jesus Christ, can you believe this, he doesn't even call his daughter on her birthday for christ sake.
What the hell do you mean going out and leaving Regan by her self! What are you kidding her window's wide open...
Oh Burke! Poor Burke!
Phonograph.
It's serious?
You were expecting a deliver y that day?
Oh, I see.
I lied. It's for me. The spelling is on the back, Kinderman. You know that film you made called Angel? Isaw that six times.
Rats?
But it's clean?
Karl? Did you put this in Regan's bedroom?
Karl if you put this in Regan's room I want you to tell me, now did you?
A stimulant.
Oh no. I'd wait and see what happens with the Ritalin. I think that's the answer. Wait two or three weeks.
Hey, come on, I'm grown-up. What'd she say? I mean specifically, Doctor.
Well, It's a symptom of a type of desturbance in the chemico- electrical activity of the brain. In the case of your daughter in the temperal lobe, up here in the lateral part of the brain. It's rare, but it does cause bizarre hallucinations and usually just before a convulsion.
Look doc, I really don't understand how her whole personality could change.
Are you sure?
You're a friend of Father Dyer, right?
Did he tell you about my party?
Didn't tell you of what she did?
On what?
Did you know my mother died recently?
Wanna drink.
What kind of stuff?
Think it was a guilding. It was grey. Oh it was so beautiful, the guy let me ride it all around.
Where?
Wait a minute you need two.
Captain who?
I love you Rags. We'll have a good day yeah?
She doesn't remeber a thing.
Where'd you get it then?
I believe you.
Do you like films?
If you're the devil, why not make the straps disappear?
He broke the bread, gave it to his disciples and said "Take this, all of you and eat. For this is my body." When the supper had ended, he took the cup, again he gave you thanks and praise. Gave the cup to his disciples and said "Take this, all of you will drink from it, this is the cup of blood, the blood of the new and ever lasting covenant and the mystery of faith".
Do it again.
You speak Latin?
Ydob eht ni mraw si ti! Uoy ees I! Tseirp a si eh! Emit su evig! Nirrem! Nirrem!
I am no one! I am no one! He is a priest!
Your Uncle John stopped by to visit me.
Do you want to hear the background of the case, first?
Save your servant
...and the power to confront this cruel demon.
Yeah, it's true. You do look like a boxer. John Garfield, in Body and Soul. Exactly John Garfield anyone told you that Father?
Let me tell you how Father, and please confidential. Burke Dennings, good Father, was found at the bottom of those steps leading to 'M' Street, with his head turned completely around. Facing backwards.
Maybe somebody crazy, someone with a spite against the church, some unconscious rebellion, perhaps.
Not to bother you with trivia, but a psychiatrist in sunny California was thrown in jail for not telling the judge what he knew about a patient.
Hey, Father? You like movies?
Yeah, I hate to go alone. You know, I like to talk film; discuss the critique. D'you wanna see a film with me? I got passes to The Crest. It's Othello.
Who?
MERRIN!!!!!!!
Miss?
Are you comfortable Regan?
How old are you?
Who is it?
I'm afraid.
Give me the keys.
Now?  Why not tomorrow?  After the show.
What about tomorrow?
Honey ...
Piano.
My brother and I. One each.
Come on, friend.  I can smell it on you. Get yourself a cup of coffee.  You'll forget what you're angry about.
Uh, Ma, you know, no one calls him that anymore. Jack. He goes by Jack.
That's not the point.
You cannot continue to walk in at the last moment, Jack.
That's a lot of water under the bridge, eh, Jack?
Count it.
Listen ... why don't you come out to the house this weekend.  Say hello to the kids. They've grown.
Cindy.
You look awful.
By the way, we gotta go see Ma tomorrow.
We gotta go, Jack.
So what'd we get her?
I made her nervous.
What's with Charlie?
What're you talking about?
What was it like?
I'm grateful, Frank.  How much? For the singer.
Thirty-seven girls. And not one who can carry a tune. That must be statistically impossible.
What are you, crazy?
You hit me.
All right, all right.  I'm a little tense.
Sounds like a booking agent looking to book an easy fee.
November.  '71.
Day.  Wednesday.
She was staying at the Grand downtown ...
We were playing the lounge one night and she came in.
I figure that way we won't get confused.
You leaving that on?
All night?
What matters to me is we've got the six easiest nights we've had in ten years. So 'Tie a Yellow Ribbon' sounds a little flat. So what?  Nobody's gonna hear it, Jack.  Nobody. So why should you care?
He's with the hotel.  I called him.
We had a leak in the bathroom. He fixed it.
He had to come quickly.  It was a big leak.
The Royal.
What're you doing?
We're not getting paid then.
Seventy-one?  What's seventy-one?
Basketballs, Frank.  You had us playing for basketballs.
Fuck you.
Jack!
How're your hands?
Right.  It was someone's birthday. Halloran?
Christ, that's right.  How could I forget.  What a nightmare.
I guess you're,right.  Well, what do you say we get a little midnight snack? Theo's should still be open.
So she's got a few sniffles.
Moran.  Monica.  The whole thing. It's my stage name.  My real name's Blanche.
Candy Man.'  Is that all right?
What do you mean?
How should I take it?
I don't believe it.  I come all the way down down here, break a heel, and you're not gonna give me a chance because I have gum on my lip and I'm a few minutes late.
Ready?
What-?
Is there a language problem here?  Your dress. For tonight.  Where is it?
It's orange!
Come on.
Hey, pal.  I don't know about you, but where I come from there's a little girl's room and a little boy's room and the little boys don't go where the little girls go.
Oh, thanks.
Fucking.
Give me that.
I guess it's,the Plaza then. That brings us to the twenty-seventh. We got the Avedon for three or the Park downtown for two.
Uh, well ... we flipped a coin.
Well, well.  Ho, ho, ho.  You moonlighting at Macy's, Frank?
You play all these places?
Go ahead.
I don't believe it.
Hey, we're connected.
Hey, will you look at that?
What's with you two?
Decency?  Hey listen, pal ...
I can't sing it anymore.
Whatcha doin' over there?
How come?
No.
They never do, Mr. Barker.
You miss him, don't you?
You kidding?  We must've killed three pots in there.  Anyway, I gotta get home.  Rest the pipes.
No. Thanks. She starts to move away, then stops and looks back.
Relax.  We'll drop the song.
What's that supposed to mean?
Oh. Hi.  Sorry.
Yeah... No.
Yeah.  The big boys sent it down yesterday.
Did you break a cup, Jack?
Guess they're up.
Jack.
Big piece or little?
None?
Waxy Wright.  Didn't Jon Archer bust you for poisoning five members of the Canadian parliament?
Uh-oh, somebody's in trouble.
Perfect fit.
Or reactivated the first one.
Pollux ...
Thanks, Pollux.
Well, you tried.  You failed miserably, but you tried.
I'm late for surgery.
... I was dreaming ...
We were back in high school. You wanted to join the sky diving team, but I wouldn't let you.
Totally -- you were being very, very bad.  You went up in the plane and jumped out.  You had a parachute, but it didn't open.
What are you saying?  Oh, God -- you're going on assignment again ...
The bomb.  He's reactivated it.  And everyone there is going to die.
This is it, Jon.  For the next 72 hours -- you're on your own.
What're you gonna do with me gone?  You'll drive your wife and kid nuts! I bet your daughter is just about ripe by now. What's her name, Janie?
Jamie ...
We've got him sighted. Okay, Pollux, pull out.
Just saving the tax-payers the cost of a trial.  So take a hike.
There's my little darling.  The night wouldn't be complete without you.
It was confirmed by your personal security code. Nobody knows that code but you!
Don't worry, nobody knows I'm inside.  Check it out.  Remember that fat fuck agent who roughed us up in Thailand?  He's being treated for bone cancer at the V.A.  Thanks to the miracle of NSA grid-technology ...  -- Ooops!  His radiation does just quadrupled.
Just following your example.
I just heard about Castor's fratricide -- rather poetic, don't you think?
I just thought that -- under the circumstances -- you might want to postpone the meeting with the station chiefs.
As much as ever.  Nothing.
-- Yes.
Where's Jamie?
Kate Reynolds was my girlfriend in college.  I almost married her...
God, no.  I thought about it for practically the entire flight...
I'll leave from the office tomorrow afternoon.  Call the group.  Schedule an emergency strategy session for noon.
Hello?
You have kids, Jack?
Thats right. And auto supply...
We did one point seven million in total revenue...
Good for you. Why shouldnt you protect whats yours.
Jack, are you okay?
Excuse me?
Rise...and...shine...!
This isnt my real life. Its just a glimpse...
Do you like kids?
This is day care.  Its where babies go when their parents are at work.
I have winter camp until four, then ballet until five thirty.
Big Eds?  Big Eds Tires?  Why...?
What are you doing?
What am I saying?  You dont need to hear that...  All I meant was a lot of people have a hard time dealing with all the forced reverie, thats all.  Is that you?
You see, its like were in each others heads...
Wheres your follow through?  Wheres your stance?
She is relentless.
Cmon, Evelyn Thompsons got no class.  She doesnt marry Dr. Steve, the womans living in a trailer.
So Jack, its your wifes birthday, got anything to say to her?
Howd you know my name?
Wait a second...  Jack...Jack...
Wheres my car?!  Wheres my Ferrari!?
Like I said, it's a business deal...
I'm just saying that you seem like a smart guy.  At a certain point you're gonna do something, and then there's no turning back...
Might wanna fasten your seat belt, Jack...
Everyone else in that store is a statue, they see their lives passing in front of their eyes, but not you.  Youre making a business deal...
Its a glimpse, Jacko.
Figure it out.  You got plenty of time.
As long as it takes to figure it out.  Which, in your case, could be considerable.
But what do I do?
Finger food...?
Something like that.
Merry Christmas to you, sir...
Mr. Mintz?  I dont think so...buildings closed pal.  Youll have to come back tomorrow.
I dont care who you are.  Its Christmas and like I told you the building is closed.
Sorry, pal.  Entrance is for residents and guests only...
I have a bad feeling about this.
Go. Im sorry, you should just go...
Look, we dont have time for this right now, well talk about it later.  Now get dressed...  Youre not wearing that to the Thompsons party. I dont care how hilarious you think it is...
Why not?
Jack...
I think it worked out okay, dont you?
The trek out to the hospital every day didnt help either...  You were great. Surviving the heart attack was one thing...
Jack, stop that. I'm still mad at you...  ...who knows what wouldve happened if you hadnt stepped in at the store.
You actually forgot our anniversary.
Now Im worried...just say it.  Whatever it is well deal with it.
I mean yes, I help people that need it...
Pretty incredible, isnt it?
Are you out of your mind?
Its been interesting, thats for sure.
To Paris. Paris, France.
Please. Lets just go have a cup of coffee. Thats all Im asking for. Im sure theres another flight to Paris tonight.
I just got a call from Terry Haight.  Bob Thomas is nervous...
Hey Peter, lemme ask you a question.  An old girlfriend calls you out of the blue on Christmas Eve...
Peter Lassiter...
...were really more of a boutique operation, as you can see...
Last night was great...
Don't you have anywhere to go?
You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.
I don't think She's real big on hate.
Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
No.  I cannot take orders from that underwear model.  That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?
What?  Come on.  She's got a good thing with Victor --
He's smart, powerful, successful --
It's about to be a broken face.
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God?  Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp.  Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
They said that's not such a good idea, the shock alone could --
Hey!  That's a <u>prototype</u>!
Oh my G-g-g.  What did you...do to Ben?
About me?  How sweet.
Reed said it'd be weeks till --
You look like an eighties rock band.
Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning, somehow --
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero who's been through a terrible orde--
You need to control yourself and <u>think</u> before you --
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
Me like-y.
Apparently I can disappear.
Stop it.
What is that <i>thing</i>?
Wait.  You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?
Uh, we call my sister the invisible girl...the Invisible Girl.
I'm driving.
What are you doing --
Front page?
This isn't going to be a problem, is it?
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
Ben's still out there --
Not until Ben is back inside!
I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you?
Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and --
Which was?
Uh, Sue...?  I <u>can't</u>.
It has to be the cloud.  It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
You should be able to bend light around other objects, even people, if you could control your emotional state better --
Reed.  I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.
There were a lot of variables to consider --
When I walked out, I waited <u>ten</u> <u>minutes</u> outside your door.  Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.
I can...make it work.
If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us <u>worse</u>, maybe even kill us.
Grant's uniquely qualified for this mission. He's a Communications Expert and was a Frogman during the War. Besides, he brought Benes into this country, and the fewer people who know about him, the better. At any rate, you'll find Grant invaluable, should anything go wrong once you're under way.  Okay, Don.
What is it?
-- and why we need you.
You mean <I'm> going along?
This is Dr. Duval, our Head Surgeon.
Yes, we'd like to get moving.
I'll be standing by. <I'll> know.
Listen...the Heart.
But we just can't leave him in there! What'll happen to him?
You're going out there? With those Antibodies --
Wouldn't it be quicker if we all helped?
Air bubbles!... Doctor --
He's making a fine recovery.
Well, it's not exactly a pleasure cruise.
A long time, with one man.
Then how come it worked loose?
Shouldn't you answer that?
Oh, no. Plenty of cause. He won't follow the herd, or change his convictions -- even when they're not popular. And he believes in an absolutely free interchange of information between scientists of different countries -- and these days, there's nothing more suspicious than that.
We better get back to the sub. Every second counts now.
We can't take a second more.
I'll do nothing of the sort! The operation is <my> responsibility! I won't do it, and that's final!
The Soul? The finite mind cannot comprehend Infinity. And the Soul which comes from God is Infinite.
--and certain chemicals involving proteins --
Yes...  We can transfer over to the Inner Ear, and go by way of the Endolymphatic Duct.
The ship's good as finished. We'll have to get out on our own! Is there a quick way out?
We need you for Security purposes, Mr. Grant.
All right now -- push the snorkel through as soon as I get inside.
Looks like somebody declared war.
What'd you do that for?
'Prepare for Miniaturization'...
Any reserve air?
What happened?
Thirty-two minutes left...  But chances are we won't have to wait that long for try-number three.
Even so, because of our size -- I mean lack of it -- we'll still be cruising mighty fast. We'll be smashed to bits if there's any turbulence --
I'll never find my way through that.
Where is Pancakes Hause?
You'll take care of it. Boy, you are smooth smooth, you know.
She started shrieking, you know.
...So I guess that's it, then.  Here's the keys -
Oh, no, it's real sound. It's all worked out.
Three people. In Brainerd.
IS IT, JERRY?  You ask those three pour souls up in Brainerd if a deal's a deal! Go ahead, ask 'em!
We had us a deal here for nineteen- five. You sat there and darned if you didn't tell me you'd get this car, these options, WITHOUT THE SEALANT, for nineteen-five!
Well, he never done this before, but seein' as it's special circumstances and all, he says I can knock one hunnert off that TruCoat.
Oh, don't be silly.
...So, I'm tendin' bar there at Ecklund & Swedlin's last Tuesday and this little guy's drinkin' and he says, 'So where can a guy find some action - I'm goin' crazy down there at the lake.'  And I says, 'What kinda action?' and he says, 'Woman action, what do I look like,' And I says 'Well, what do I look like, I don't arrange that kinda thing,' and he says, 'I'm goin' crazy out there at the lake' and I says, 'Well, this ain't that kinda place.'
So he says, 'So I get it, so you think I'm some kinda jerk for askin',' only he doesn't use the word jerk.
And he says, 'Yah, that guy's dead and I don't mean a old age.' And then he says, 'Geez, I'm goin' crazy out there at the lake.'
Hiya, Norm. How ya doin', Margie? How's the fricassee?
Yah.
Yah.
A subconscious-type thing.
Okay. We'll get the money together. Don't worry about it, Jerry. Now, d'you want anyone at home, with you, until they call?
So you're goin' to the Gophers on Sunday?
...How ya doin' there, Scotty?
Dad, I really think we should call the cops.
Well, you can help me. My name's Marge Gunderson -
Yah, ya know we've got the big statue there. So you haven't had any vehicles go missing, then?
Yah, it's this vehicle I asked you about yesterday. I was just wondering -
Okay, are you sure, cause, I mean, how do you know?  Because, see, the crime I'm investigating, the perpetrators were driving a car with dealer plates. And they called someone who works here, so it'd be quite a coincidence if they weren't, ya know, connected.
Yah, but -
But the deal's already done, I already got the money -
I mean send it over. I'll shoot it right over to ya.
Well... yah.
Yah!
Yah!  I... those are in the mail.
Yah, you bet. It's in the lot there. Brand-new burnt umber Ciera.
Yah, how ya doin'. So, uh, we all set on this thing, then?
Are you calling Stan?
Yah, you said you'd have a think about it. I understand it's a lot of money -
Yah, well, it's a chunk, but -
Stan and I're okay.
What the heck were you thinkin'? Heck, if I'm only gettin' bank interest, I'd look for complete security. Heck, FDIC. I don't see nothin' like that here.
- All's I know is, ya got a problem, ya call a professional!
A million dollars is a lot a damn money! And there they are, they got my daughter!
Dammit! I wanna be a part a this thing!
Hiya, Lou.
I'd be very surprised if our suspect was from Brainerd.
Ya see something down there, Chief?
Geez, you okay, Margie?
...Well, that passed.
Oh, yah. Norm made some eggs.
...Last vehicle he wrote in was a tan Ciera at 2:18 a.m.  Under the plate number he put DLR - I figure they stopped him or shot him before he could finish fillin' out the tag number.
Yah, that's a good one.
...You can sleep, hon. It's early yet.
Gotta eat a breakfast, Marge.  I'll fix ya some eggs.
Yah, that's me.
...This is a nice place.
You were such a super lady...  and then I... I been so lonely...
Yep.
...I know you don't want to be an accessory to something like that.
Hello?
Well, it was nothin' specific he said, it just seemd like it all hit him really hard, his wife dyin' -
Oh. Oh, my.
And this guy is...
But we still haven't found Gustafson.
Sorry - didn't copy.
...Chief Gunderson?
Yes, ma'am. Are we the closest PD?
Thanks, hon. Time to shove off.
You bet. Thanks for lunch. What do we got here, Arbie's?
Yah, okay. How's the hotel?
They announced it?
And his wife?
That wouldn't interest you.
The first rule of Project --
Bob was a champion bodybuilder.  You know that chest expansion program you see on TV?  That was his idea.
I'm going to need you out-of-town a little more this week.  We've got some "red-flags" to cover.
Telling me off.  Is it going as well as you hoped... ?  "... Mr. Taylor."
I want brain parasites.
So far, you have four and I only have two!
So, we each have three -- that's six. What about the seventh day?  I want ascending bowel cancer.
Looks like this is goodbye.
Picture yourself watching Marla Singer throw herself around her crummy apartment.
Except for their humping, Tyler and Marla were never in the same room.
You're such a nutcase, I can't even begin to keep up.
No, thanks.
Uh ... nah.
Really... I mean it.  Have you been going to your groups?
When?
Why would you get bent if I asked?
Yeah?
I'm sorry, I...
Sixty seconds, then I'm out of here.
Because... I'm Tyler Durden.
Two sides?  You're Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Jackass.
Leave me alone!  I don't ever want to see you again!
My God, you're shot...
Is this a test, sir?
You were in here last Thursday night.
You're the one who did this to me. You're Mr. Durden, sir.  Tyler Durden.
Throwers don't worry about ticking. Modern bombs don't tick.
Baggage handlers.  But when a suitcase vibrates, the throwers have to call the police.
I had everything in that bag.  My C.K. shirts... my D.K.N.Y. shoes...
Tonight, we're going to open the green door -- the heart chakra...
If I did have a tumor, I'd name it Marla.  Marla...the little scratch on the roof of your mouth that would heal if only you could stop tonguing it, but you can't.
One minute.  This is the beginning.  We're at ground zero.  Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.
We have front row seats for this Theater of Mass Destruction.  The Demolitions Committee of Project Mayhem wrapped the foundation columns of ten buildings with blasting gelatin.  In two minutes, primary charges will blow base charges, and those buildings will be reduced to smoldering rubble.  I know this because Tyler knows this.
This is how I met --
What do you do, Tyler?
What?
I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.
I don't... think so.
God, it's late.  I should find a hotel...
What?
Why would anyone want this shitty job?
Shit.  Sorry.  That didn't count.
How do you feel?
But a good strange.
The fight.
My boss, probably.  Who would you fight?
What are you reading?
Alive or dead?
You're okay with this?
Hey... don't knock librarians.
You want to finish her off?
Stop it.  This is your pain -- your burning hand.  It's right here.  Look at it.
I... I think I understand.  I think I get it...
This is the greatest moment of your life and you're off somewhere, missing it.
Yeah.  Where you headed?
There's fight club in Delaware City.
What are we doing?
Hey.
What do you want?  A statement of purpose... ?
Should I E-mail you?  Should I put this on your "action item list?"
I want to hear the truth.
What are you talking about?
And, we're definitely filling a void in the rural South.
He's not here!  Tyler's not here anymore!  He's gone away!
You took me to the house.
You have jobs.
What are you doing running through the streets in your underpants?  We both use that body.
Fuck you.
You want out?
Defuse the bomb?
One minute.
Can't you call it off... ?
Please...
Damn it!  God-damn it...
NO...
No more running off without you. From here on out, we do it together.
Excuse me?
Abort the plan.
It's what he would have wanted, sir.
But, this is Project Mayhem.
But, in Project Mayhem, we have no names.
Robert Paulson?
His name is Robert Paulson!
Okay!  Okay, fuck it!  Use the basement!  Get off me!
Is this a picture of Mom and Dad?
Animals.
Yeah, how?
That's good.  Get all your tears out now, you'll need your eyes.  For the signs.
If you have the same power as Alex, you'll be seeing signs soon.  When you see anything creepy or ominous, an in-your-face irony kinda thing? Don't ignore it.  It usually means the difference between life and death.
No!  It can't be.
Here we go.  The vehicle's a delivery van registered to Jorge and Isabella Cruz.  And Christ, there's almost a dozen domestic disturbance complaints on these two.
A guard grabbed me before I could find Eugene.
Um, Clear?  I'm sorry...about before. I...
Dano, shouldn't we go back and help your mother?
What?
May we come in?
We had a fight.  Some things got broken, the dog went crazy, she left me.  Wouldn't say where she was going.
Take a guess.
This can't be happening.  My career's at a peak, I finally met a cute guy, I just bought a new house...
I got that beat.  So like, last May, I was supposed to stay at this cheesy bed and breakfast in Pennsylvania. There was a major gas leak no one knew about and all the guests suffocated during the night.
Turn around.  The cleaning woman said they're at the dentist's. 14th and Main.
This is cheery.
It throws the entire Death list out of whack.  And a new list has to be rewritten from scratch.  We all start over with a clean slate.
Whoa, nine months?
Stop it, don't move him!
But it's over.  Isabella's baby was the key.  You saw her die and everything, right?
Relax, you need to chill the fuck out.
When I die.  Is it gonna hurt?
Kimberly?  It's Dad.
I mean it.  Take care of it.
I'm sorry.  I'm just so happy that you're safe.
You're all certifiable, you know that?  I can't believe I've been listening to this crap.  Come on, Tim, let's go outside.
It's only the end of June.
4:25.
Get out! Get out of the car!  Get out of the fuckin' car!
You know what to do.
You're payin' for my trip, Browning!
We're losing our favorite teacher.
Is knowing going to make it easier? It makes it harder.
Fag.
Yes... see, there's this... pattern... that's occuring.
I'm sorry we broke in.
Please tell me I'm gonna get to see the Jets win the Super Bowl.
Knock it off!
You guys are real... aren't you?
You mean the snake?
What's that?
Cocktail party.  Uh huh, right.  Let's saddle up.
Why would they send us to a deserted camp?
Gawd, you look awful.
You're gonna love it.
You really got a Masters Degree?
And how'd you sneak up like that?
Go United States.  See Nguyen. Maybe teach economics.  Buy Cadillac.  Watch "Dynasty."
Yes you can.
What was that?
Alternate LZ Zulu Sierra at 0500. It says "May have heat.  Don't be late.  All our love."
Stay on your heading, Captain.
Why me?
This operation is in two phases. Recon and rescue.  You are phase one.  Your two-man team will probe the site, confirm the presence of American POWs, if any, make photographic and tactical observations, then proceed to the extraction point without engaging the enemy.
Negative.  Absolutely not.  The phase two assault team will get them out.
I didn't know you were a stick man, Rambo.
All this is for us?
Typical...
How long before you're fully on line?
You think they'll find any?
Take your time.
"Terminate with extreme prejudice."
What's your name?
Hello, John.
Hardcore outfit.  The best I ever trained.
Let's do it.
Will it hurt?
...SO...anybody special in your life?
You know, let me tell you something! I'm not that kind of person. I don't do people favors. If I talk to you it's because I want to. So we're not all ...uh...Jerri Hall...Big deal... What a boring world if we were. You do the best you can with what you got. You're not so so invisible, ya know... You want make an impression? Try this; you can be a real bitch.
No really..I can't.
<u>You're surprised</u>!... But I guess I just never met the right guy.  Whatta gonna do?
Are you in a mood today baby? Is this one of those days when you're in ...whadda call it... an emotional abyss?  Talk to me, cause I don't understand these moods.
<u>What</u>!
Oh, I used to be such a Catholic.
... You have a little... uh... something on your face...
Lydia?!  Lydia who!?
I was not with a woman last night.  I was out with Parry.
Hello....congratulations.
Well talk back.  He won't bite you.
What are you two up to?
No.
You can't even give me that?!  What were you gonna do, Jack?... Just gonna organize your life...  ... walk out that door, move in by yourself and what -- drop the news when you find somebody else?  What were you planning to do, Jack?
I think.. I...I realized...I love you.
Yeah so? The guy's beat up - he...he probably has a concussion or something, right?  He'll snap out of it?
Yeah, but does she swallow, Edwin?
You a friend of Parry's?
... First time in my life I'll be a voice with a body.  Do you know what that means?  What this could lead to?
How un-sixties of you.
Huh-huh.
Hello. My name is Lydia Sinclair.
Free?
God, I have no idea.  She's worked here for fifteen years and I have no idea.  I'll call her.
Hi... Where are my shoes?
They said you're The One.
I think you're a very nice... very nice psychotic man.  I really appreciate what you did for me.  It was a very brave and noble thing...
Do you follow her every day?
Why did you do that?
Here...I just would like to help you. I thought...maybe...you could use some money.
Here's another twenty. Will that do?  I mean, what's it going to take!
He knows who you are!  He's afraid!  I can tell!
Parry...
.....What are you doing?
Are there any questions?
Holdin' my penis...
Are you all right?
You can't leave me tied up out here alone, you fucking faggot!
I never say anything I have to.
I don't drink coffee...
That's a wig you wear, isn't it?
You're not going to play it again.
Now quit, Bobby. You said you're goin' a help me pick a song.
I'll go out with you, or I'll stay here, and do anything you'd like for me to do... if you'll just do one thing. If you'll tell me that you love me.
You know what, you are never satisfied.
Come on. We're goin' over to Elton's.
You just going to sit there?
Come on, DiPesto. We can still have a good time.
I'm sorry.
I'll be gone two or three weeks.
You like it?
What?
'Cause if it was me, I could just catch a Greyhound back.
This certainly is an improvement on the motel an' the coffee shop.  How could you have left such a beautiful place, Bobby?
I'm gonna go in that cafe an' get some coffee. You want anything?
Sure you don't want anything?
What's your name?
Alaska.
No. We have tomatoes.
One Number Two, and a chicken sal san -- hold the butter, the mayo, the lettuce -- and a cup of coffee... Anything else?
Oh.
Oh God, I'm so glad, Robert, that you're coming...
Well, I really appreciate it, Carl.
Why? Am I some kind of freak to you or something?
You're leaving?
What have you been doing since then?
If you're free.
You think I'm a fake.
Yes, it was. You've made it clear that if I can cut a little piano, I might get a little response.
It's convenient to fake looking for something right now, isn't it?
I don't find your language that charming.
No inner feeling.
Carl restored my confidence. He really did. He's much more substantial than you give him credit for.
Robert?
I'm sorry everything's been so confusing, but I have to go, Robert...
No. It's useless, Robert. It wouldn't work, not ever...
That'll make you happy.
Did you hear about my misfortune, Robert?
She's tremendously gifted, this girl.
I don't understand why you had to stay in a motel. There's more than enough room here.
Oh no, it's been much more than that.
Come on, Terry, we got a ride!
There'd never be a hole big enough. Now took at me, for instance, when I was just one person, before Bobby, I had so much garbage collectin' onto me every day, I was thinkin' about gettin a dispose all...
Well...
And you know, I read where they invented this car that runs on... that runs on... when you boil water...
John believes in the basic goodness of man, and that's fine, but gaze into the pit like I have and that view seems a little soporific. And not unlike television, it hardly represents the real world...
Pardon me?
If you want to call it that.
For once in your life have some 	respect for me, don't even curse at me or nothin'.
Yo.
So you got a girl?
A play-ya.
That's it?
Come down!
Why don't you ask Eddie?
Why?
Forget it! C'mon Let's go to the pool.
Amanda is Eddie's cousin.
The one with the phat ass?
How does he look up close?
I think he's 18 or 17.
My friend told me she lived around here.
You wanna do somethin' with me?
Where you know Amanda from?
Look. You know that and I know that, but somebody's bucking for a promotion. I think it's that bozo, Hanrahan, I can't be sure. Anyway, unless I go back there with something, you and your son-in-law are next week's scapegoats.
What?
Maybe tonight?
Fletch.
Your editor called me yesterday to respond to allegations you're about to print about police involvement in narcotics dealing. Fletch starts to get up, but Cummings plants his foot on Fletch's chest, forces him back down.
What the hell are you doing here?
Mrs. Smith.
Right.
Margaret.
Sure, but the end was so sudden.
For sure?
Jesus.
Oh, I'll help, Fletch. I'm a slave to that sonofabitch. He busted me, third offense, gave me a choice: Work for him or do fifteen long. All I get out of this is free snort.
Gonna need it. That boy is dangerous. Fletch?
Doctor Holmes went to get you some smelling salts. He was quite surprised that you fainted.
Here you are, Doctor.
You should have proved that in a court of law.
He doesn't read my stuff well.  'Sally Ann and Alan were married four years ago and never divorced, making Stanwyk a bigamist even in Utah. Stanwyk is also traveling with three million dollars in cash, the result of Gail Stanwyk's conversion of Boyd Aviation stock. Mrs. Stanwyk believed the money was to be used to purchase property in Utah, but it wasn't; a fact that can be confirmed by realtor James Swarthout of Provo.'  That was stupid, Alan.
I'm Harry S. Truman from Casewell Insurance Underwriters.
My parents were great fans of the former President.
California. San Berdoo. Utah's part of my route. Can I ask you a few questions?
Okay.  Now, the last time you saw your son was when?
Lets see, it was before he moved to L.A... four years April.
I really creamed the sonofabitch, didn't I?
John Ultramalensky, right?
Rio de Janeiro, maybe?
We can't talk about it here.
Because we can't.
I'll give you a thousand dollars cash just to come to my house and listen to the proposition. If you reject the proposition, you keep the thousand, and your mouth shut.
Then I found out Hopalong Cassidy had shot himself in the game room. That just blew it for me.
I'm still here.
I have the same problem with my help.
A .357.
So it looks like a burglary attempt. You catch me. I get the gun, and shoot you.
Do you have a passport?
I am not someone who leaves a great deal to chance, Mr. Nugent.
That's right.
Cute young thing, too.
Oh, that's all right, I've got lots more. Want to see the reception?
Alan's in Utah.
I really should change.
I mean put clothes on.
Have you gotten cuter since I last saw you?
Thanks, I feel much better. Listen, if you're so bored, why didn't you go to Utah with Alan?
Good point.
What about his parents?
So?
He told me he was dying of cancer. Not True. That ranch you thought you were paying for in Utah? Not true.
He's a bad guy, Mrs. Stanwyk. Gail. I think he's involved in something very big and very bad.
Have you ever heard the name Jim Swarthout?
Wrong. He sold you $3,000 worth of scrub brush.
No. You can't. Look, I know you don't know me from Adam, but you've got to trust me.
Wait a second. What am I supposed to do for twenty-four hours?
I've never lied to him before.  It's the first time he's ever lied to me. He was just as convincing as when he says 'I love you.'
Are you telling me my husband is a bigamist???
I don't have all the pieces yet, but I'm close. I'll know tomorrow.
Don't worry, I can take it.
They just left, sir.
Hi, where's Mrs. Stanwyk?
I would, actually.
Right. Tell you what -- have you caviar?
Muchas gracias.
Excuse me. I have something I'd like to discuss with you.
The door was unlocked.
No wonder.
I commend him on his choice.
Where is she?
I spoke to her last week. She didn't say anything.
Fletch.
'Uh, almost' is not an answer. 'Yes Frank, it's all done': that's an answer.
Two...
I never read the paper.
Now, Irwin, try to follow me. You can't run the ad and then not run the story.
Just kidding, Frank. You'll have the story and you'll be damn proud of it.
Gummy and two cops...
You're onto something. That's good. What?
Yeah. It's wedged in between Wyoming and Nevada. I'm sure you've seen pictures.
I have some ideas.
Yes?
Oh, that!  Don't take it personally. He always wakes up before I do. Down boy!  Roseanne Barr naked!
Now that we've broken the ice...
No thanks.  I carry my own.
Five thousand should be enough to assuage any qualms you have about my family tree.
Listen, Queen Collie, I have a code. I never, ever, drop a case.  Besides, I, uh, used all your money to pay my bills, so I kinda owe you.
So many assholes, so few bullets.
I've heard cars fuck with more harmony.
You're friends with the most obnoxious asshole on the airwaves. The King of the Shock Jocks.  I'm, I'm shocked.
That's for me... Radio contests, really Ford, how tacky...
Quiet.  Tell me you tapped in the police computer and found out lots of good stuff about Art Mooney...
And it's good to see you, Julian. This is my assistant, Jazz.
Ah, an obvious choice.
Your timing swallows the massive one. Grendel just tried to kill us, he's about to frame and kiss Don, and we can't do shit.  Don't even ask about those discs. Goddamn that Art Mooney with a star by his name!  It's tied to Johnny's C.D., I know.
Yeah, Colleen mentioned it.  What do they make?
Hey, they blew me.
A simple 'please' would suffice...
What?  Jesus, tell me!
Yeah, it's weird.  Bobby and Johnny were such good friends...
This is boring, guys.
This way...
Are you okay?
I got something serious to dis-cuss.
Fuck that, I mean, the heck with that.  I kicked their ass!  Well, I tried.  There were two of them you know...
Where's my father?  Have you even looked?
Yeah, go on...
I need someone to help me with my case load, you interested?  This whole father/son thing, if you're not into it, I mean, it's okay. You know what I'm saying?
If you're hiding something... oh, oh, I'll have so much fun.
'Booty Time.'
God, I wish I could prove you killed everybody.  Unfortunately, I know who the real killer is.
Feel my thumb?  I keep it there forty seconds more and a welt develops cutting off the oxygen to your brain.  I leave.  Twenty- one minutes later, you're dead. The slowest, most painful minutes a person can experience.
What's fine?
How's it going?
Good to meet you, Mr. Fairlane. Your mouth makes quite a reflection.  I'm Julian Grendel.
Uh, nice piano.  Probably get a lot of complaints from the neighbors -- heh...  It's another time, Julian, another place.  If I told you Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and Colleen Sutton were the ones you were complaining about, the ones who tried to rip you off, what would your reaction be?
It doesn't have to be like this?
<u>Okay</u>!  Okay.  You got me.  Boy, you guys are tough.  I have the third disc.  Indeed.  I.  Do. Yes, sir.  Yeah you assholes, it's in a very safe place with instructions to have it sent directly to the police if I don't make a phone call by seven o'clock.  So if you'll excuse us...
Shit.
Yeah, it's pretty amazing how much cash you gotta give to the actual artists who create the music.  Those ingrates really take a bite.  But seriously, when Pops died, you got Vomit, Crunch, and Sutton to help finance a C.D. Cleans operation. You got greedy and they tried to get the three discs together to threaten you, but...
You heard that Bobby Vomit O.D.'d, right?  Do you suspect foul play and stuff?
Hey, troops, here's that rock 'n' roll detective I told you about.
I don't believe it.  Getting paid to be the asshole you always were.
What?
How's everything?
How come there's nothing out there? That stuff is all milk.
B.O.C.A.
What?
Man, I'm clean.
Allo... Salvatore...
Tu sais j'ai réfléchi longuement à ton cadeau pour le voyage.  Je l'ai choisi moi-même.  Tiens.
Mais non, c'est pour toi.
Comment va-t-elle?
I'm afraid they've become a bit... over-cautious.  Our American friends.
You're in show business.
I'm sorry, I don't know who you mean.
There's nobody like that on six.
That's in France.
What ya doin' out so late?  Hidin' from the cops?
Why not?
Yeah, we got the Westbury covered like a tent.
Let's popeye around the Chez for a half hour, catch the end of the show and a couple drinks.
The greaser with the blonde.
We got information that there's no shit in the street -- it's like a desert full of junkies with a big score coming in to make everybody well.
You want the red or the white?
My ass.  The only reason you're in this is because you've got a big expense account for buying junk and you like to see your picture in the papers.
Same car.
Pass.
No.  Many are involved in crimes and confiscated... or just abandoned. This is, as you know, your prime source of scrap metal, M. Charnier.
Two railroads as part of a connecting railway which provided passage from New England to the South.  It was actually the first railroad through New York City.
It was a crematorium.
What am I, a shmuck?  What's the hurry?  He could see a couple of shows and visit the top of the Empire State Building.
That was over thirty years ago.  I paid for that and then some.
Sexual assault, Daryl.  Five years.  But you got lucky, right?  You got away with something else.  Something you figured nobody knows about.
You're shitting me!
We gotta go underground.  Get those guys out, now.
How do we get to the vault door?
Boy is he excited about the game tomorrow.
Satch, you gotta just give me...Satch is here John.  You hear me?  Satch is here.
What is going on here, Satch?  What are those guys doing out there?
As nuts as that sounds, yes.
Deleon.
Where are you transmitting from?
Sorry 'bout that.  So Queens, you psyched for the Series?
You're telling me your name is Frank Sullivan, you live in Queens and you just saw the first game of the '69 Series...live?
Gordo, if this is you, so help me...
What the hell...
What's going on?
Oh my god.
We gotta be bouncing off the mother sun spot of all time.
Yeah, that's how Hams work.
Why?
On the job?
But that's tomorrow.
Dad...?
What?  Johnny, what's wrong?
What?  What is it?
Whatta you mean...
What are you talking about?
You ever talk to a victim's family?  The one's left behind?  They don't act like what you'd think.  There's panic and fear.  But mostly, it's like there's this logic problem.  And if they could only solve it, everything would be okay.  But if you look real close - look at their eyes - you can see it.  Just a glimmer.  But somewhere they know.  They know their world is never gonna be the same.
What do I tell them?
You all right?
We got him!  Dad you got him!
I got it.
You're telling me this maniac is a cop? What the hell am I supposed to do with that one?
Hey, Sull.  My cable's out again.
John.  John, you all right?
My father didn't die in a fire?
Don't choke on your pride, Sull.  You ain't ever gonna catch another one like that.
Our lucky break.  Mario ID'd the dental. Mary Finelli...reported missing April 16, 1968.
Not the first time that's been true.  I'm telling you, I got a feeling about this guy.  This is the guy, Satch.
He ain't our guy, John.
I'm sure everything'll work out.  She really loves you...
Hey, future boy.  Frank tells me you're a cop?
Wife around?
The 2-3.  Homicide.
My name is Abel.  And I am my brother's keeper.
Going?  How do you mean?
What're you gonna do?
Derek... stop.
You know what I've been through. Don't ever scare me like that.
You can say... "Hello, how are you?"... for starters.
Just slow down.  Let me get to know you again.  Let me get to know this place again.
Look what I found.  Remember these?
This is too painful to look at.
You know, I'm not sure I could live anywhere else.  The nights are always so peaceful and quiet.
Why did you come back here?
What happened that night?
You know him?
That scarecrow?  Can't you tell how weird his is just by looking at him.
I don't see anything.
This has been on helluva beginning to a quiet weekend in the country.
We had a slight misunderstanding with that motorcycle gang...  ... but Shelly made them see the error of their ways.
Vera... you and I have had a chance to really get to know one another today.  I like you... very much.  I was thinking that maybe.
Will you hurry up!  I gotta get this fuckmobile back before Horace finds out I took it.
Don't worry about it.  Just stay cool.
Is that all you found?
Never should've let her play.
Come on, Dad.  You could have Rick drive down Cunningham Road and look for them.
When are you going to stop treating me like one!
...And I said, shut up!
Yeah, hi.  Listen, I've got to talk to your dad.  About Jason. I've got a plan.  I need to buy some things first but mainly need help to...
What?
There...Ya happy?
Okay, give it back.
Okay, listen...what's your name, sweetie?
That's debatable.
I'm sure Cort and Sissy are back in their cabins.  So you just go back to sleep and don't worry.
So where's Cort gone off to?
I just realized something. Where's Cort?  I haven't seen him for hours.
Now you better cool out a minute, boy.  You already almost got your head blown to pieces.
Aren't you the kid whose mother and friends were....
And you've been at some psychiatric clinic ever since, haven't you?
If you'd just go to the cemetery, you'll see I'm not lying.
Don't concern yourself, Martin. This boy needs treatment.  We're taking care of it.  Sorry for the disturbance.
Eight times.
In the media, you've frequently been described as "salty" --
I understand.  However, our audience should be aware that you only charged forty thousand dollars to catch the Idaho skin stretcher.
You need to leave.
Everything going okay?
Legs giving you trouble?
Steven buggin' you?
Jesus!
Why didn't you tell me?
Does he know about what happened?
Is this Anthony?...Yeah, well, I just have one question for you, Anthony -- did you fuck my dog?
Randy, c'mon!
How many times do you want to hear this?
What do you mean you've never made a prank call?
I hear the crew members are cute guys in their twenties.
He's undefeated, you know that?  Julius is the only senior I'd even consider doing it with. If he wasn't black, that is.
It's not that, it's just that...  It I get caught, I'll lose my science scholarship and everything.
Right.
Did you hear that?
What's that?
Jason's here in New York.
All right. But if it mysteriously disappears en route, I'll have you sent back home the minute we dock. Understood?
I'm her legal guardian, not you or anybody else, and I alone know what's best for her. End of discussion.
He never learned how either and he's still at the bottom of this lake.
I...I can't...
Since the school is closing anyway, I'm going to write that novel I've been threatening on everybody.
Maybe not. But you're not telling me everything, are you?
Did you have an accident in the lake?
Yes...
Rennie...
I heard you weren't coming.
I don't know...we've gone off course or something...
Rule one, don't panic. Rule two, assess the damage and act accordingly...
Don't talk like that.
But didn't we know it would happen?
Suffering. You exude a person who sits in a small dark apartment eating soft white bread.
What happened eighteen months ago?
And he was there?
Do you want me to tell you what it was like, reading that review at the newstand with trucks rumbling past and street vendors facing Mecca?
I used to carry a gun when I drove a cab.
I think you're a little confused. Nothing personal friend.
Does it feel comfortable?
She died.
That's not all, Nicky. I've been backing your plays for fifteen years. And I've never been more depressed.
I used to tell myself. Talent is more erotic when it's wasted. Will I see you tonight?
It makes me so mad. Steven Schwimmer ready to strike. The exterminating angel.
I'm seeing your play tonight, remember?
She's doing like those Iranians. `I divorce thee. I divorce thee. I divorce thee'
If lawyers for the mob are called controversial, why are divorce lawyers called prominent?
Laurel. Tickets are all set. I double-checked.
Opening night?
I see the outline of your body in chalk on this very floor.
You have to tell me what you thought of the play.
I have this thing where I have to know a person is being honest with me before, you know, I can feel completely free to be myself.
Your father said you might be here.
I want to be fair-minded, Nicky.
We did it in the office. She thought her apartment was too impersonal.
Hey, Pop. I know you don't like the commotion of opening night. But I especially want you to see this play. It's new territory for me. And for you too. I have to know what you think.
Call me Frankie. And it looks like we're going nowhere.
It's a complicated subject.
Then say it.
Don't worry. It's a test.
If they lost tonight, they'll lose tomorrow. It's all over.
I was six years old the day Pesky hesitated throwing home and Slaughter scored all the way from first. That's when I knew the Red Sox were my team. Pity and terror.
And you're not saying that because of the gun in my hand?
'm not worried about this kid.
Game six is history,pal.
Yes.
What's good?
You've worked with Elliot?
So does Elliot.
Elliot wants to kill him with a railroad spike.
Is it true?
No one's waiting.
Do you want to talk about doing crazy things.
Stay. Teach me to be compassionate.
No -- prison is rather agreeable to me, and there is no doubt that after the war, independence will come. My only worry is what shape it will take. Jinnah has --
You really are going to Pakistan, then?  You are a stubborn man.
That's the sort of thing you'll be seeking on this "farm"...
No violence, please.
What are you doing?
If I want to be one with them, I have to live like them.
I'm sure your legs are quite as handsome as mine.
And Jinnah?
What do you want?
Without a paper -- a journal of some kind -- you cannot unite a community.  You belong to a very important profession.
I don't know... I'm still searching for a "response."
It's beautiful.
And you've come all this way because you think something is going to happen?
It is foolish if it is just to save the life of an old man.
The honor is ours. May I introduce Mr. Kallenbach. He's an old friend  and his interest is in flowers. I presumed to tell him he could wander your gardens while we talked.
You mean a general strike?
I must say when I first saw you as a bumbling lawyer here in Bombay I never thought I'd be greeting you as a national hero.
It must have been the only Non-violent campaign ever led by a man who wanted to kill everybody every day.
We need your help!
In Calcutta it's like civil war. The Muslims rose and there was a bloodbath, and now the Hindus are taking revenge -- and if we can't stop it there'll be no hope for the Hindus left in Pakistan.
You almost sound like you believe that.
Who are you trying to convince?
No?  What's keeping you?
I guess so.  Well, while you're up there, maybe you could tidy the place up a bit.
And don't go getting everybody lost out there. You'll give us a bad name.  You won't have me to keep an eye on you, you know.
I don't understand why you were dragged out here, Sir.  It's hardly worth wasting your time--a no-nothing case like this.
With respect, Sir--it may be the only unaccountable specimen but the profile suggests--
We're in the wrong place.  We're wasting time.
--There's that word again.  I have a feeling This man doesn't play the odds, Detective.  Not exactly a slave to probability.  Is it "likely" that a man who has successfully eluded authorities for fifteen years--a brutal killer--is going to come to us now like a lamb?
I don't like anybody <i>this</i> unlucky.  Widen the sweep.  The West side.  Draw a five mile radius around Gattaca.  Hoover some of the classier establishments.  Random car stops.
Don't underestimate these imposters.
We don't have the manpower.
Positive saliva match.  The cup was definitely used since the original sweep.
Twelve have a mission within the week.
I have to know where you come from.
What about this?
At least up there your piss will be worth something.  You'll all be showering in it, right?
You know I wasn't drunk--I knew what I was doing when I walked in front of that car--
Call German.
Come on--we're taking off.
They'll recognize me.
If you say so.  The stripe.
How are you, Jerome?
How the hell did you get here.
First, we may as well decide on gender. Have you given it any thought?

These new personality corrections I've been reading about.
Not that.
Hugo!  I've found him!
So we don't know for sure about you, either.
Why don't we say we were together?
Have they found our friend?
Does it have a name?
So you didn't do it after all.
What <i>is</i> this place?
What about the car?
A year is a long time.
Flight got you nervous?
What are you doing?
--I've read your profile.  I don't know about the father but you carry enough hereditary factors on your own.  You can have other children.
The name?  For the certificate.
All it takes is a long arm.
You hired Jackson and Rudy., not me.
I'm in a hurry.
Close... but it takes a hell of a lot more than promises to pull the kind of strings I pulled.
You want to drive?
Feel good?
Where do you want to go?
It doesn't look like that.
What's Beynon got set up?
I hope so. I am not looking forward to another stretch.
How does it taste?
How's Estelle?
Couldn't handle it then. Now I can.
Wait... give me a minute.
Why are you laughing?
That doesn't hurt.
Keep going over these. I don't want anybody getting lost.
It doesn!t make much difference where you are, if you're waiting, Doc.
So what. I've got to give him his money. That was our end of the deal.
Your kind of mistakes are going to land me back in Huntsville.
Texas is a big state.
There may be a hunting party.
You can't trust anything these days.
Where are you going?
Okay?
Do what I tell you, it's not a game.
Okay.
Jeep. There's a dry river bed fifteen miles east. He takes us to the Mexican side, drops us off at the airfield by breakfast... we've got a 9 o'clock flight.
I don't know.
What is it?
Are we going to make it?
Whatever happens... we're going all the way.
No, I'm not.
All right. Shells?
I 'm handling the fine stuff. You're back up all the way...
I'll hang on to these. We don't need them till we get to Gollie«s. Okay. Any questions?
How's Mama and the kids?
Drive.
I guess you ain't gonna shoot me, are you?
You do what he says, Harold.
Hello, Jack,  I don't know anything, Jack.
You can't get away from me, Albert.
What did he say?
You knew what I'd do.
What do you want?
Oh ay?
How'd it happen, then?
Five grand. It belongs to you. Along with a little name I'm going to give you.
Good afternoon, Mr Brumby. Carter exits.
What about?
How were things between you and Frank?
I don't believe you, Margaret. Frank wasn't like that.  I'm the villain in the family, remember?
You know Sid Fletcher?
Oh yes. When he came up on business.
We went about together.
Yes, while he was here.
Could you do me a favour?
A fairy godmother, all of your own. Aren't you lucky?
To the demon king's castle, of course.
And what was that?
Who's setting you up in this place?
Aren't you scared Kinnear will find out?
What kind of entertaining?
I want to give you an Oscar.
The young girl. Who pulled her?
Was it Albert?
Then he must have pulled her.
Now tell me the truth.
Thanks for coming.
Oh, what you doing now?
You work here, Keith?
What you having, Jack?
Heard of a man called Thorpe?
Ever been into an arcade there and put a penny in the slot machine?
Stuff it! My girl friend's coming from Liverpool tonight.  Nice surprise, isn't it?
What is it?
What'll they do to him?
'Cos I know you wear purple underwear.
Did you sleep well?
What you going to do?
You coming back?
Oh, that's nice.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Cyril didn't like it, either.
Scotch, please.
Of course, of course. Well, any time, just drop by.
Gerald phoned us in the middle of the night, said he'd heard you've been making a nuisance of yourself.
We know why you're all steamed up, and so do Gerald and Sid.
Put it away, Jack. You know you won't use it.
All right. Two hundred.
Four hundred?
Polacks and deadbeats.
Deadbeats all.
You did?
You had one you'd know it.  Patel. They keep coming up.  I don't know. They like to talk to salesmen.  They're lonely, something.  They like to feel superior, I don't know.  Never bought a fucking thing. You're sitting down "The Rio Rancho this, the blah blah blah," "The Mountain View--" "Oh yes.  My brother told me that..." They got a grapevine.  Fuckin' Indians, George. Not my cup of tea.  Speaking of which I want to tell you something:  I never got a cup of tea with them. You see them in the restaurants.  A supercilious race.  What is this look on their face all the time?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Their broads all look like they just got fucked with a dead cat, I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't like it. Christ...
The whole fuckin' thing...The pressure's just too great.  You're ab...you're absolu...they're too important.  All of them.  You go in the door.  I..."I got to close this fucker, or I don't eat lunch," "or I don't win the Cadillac..." We fuckin' work too hard.  You work too hard.  We all, I remember when we were at Platt...huh?  Glen Ross Farms... didn't we sell a bunch of that..."
They did.
...that's right...
For some sales pro...
He's doing very well.
The nurses?
River Oaks, Brook Farms.  All of that shit.  Somebody told me, you know what he's clearing himself? Fourteen, fifteen grand a week.
Yes.  It is.  It is simple, and you know what the hard part is?
He made up those rules, and we're working for him.
As a "robbery"?!  No.
So all this, um, you didn't, actually, you didn't go talk to Graff.
Yes.
A buck a shot.
A job with Graff.
He'd give me a job.
That's right, the guys are moving them downtown.  After the thirtieth. Murray and Mitch.  After the contest.
Dave.
They come to you, you going to turn me in?
Are you sure?
...I thought that we were only talking...
Why are you doing this to me, Dave. Why are you talking this way to me? I don't understand.  Why are you doing this at all...?
I do?
Fine.
I, you know, they should be insured.
He said he filed...
They stole...
Where criminals can come in here... they take the...
Were the leads...
See...?  Were you the guy who broke in?
Then don't sweat it, George, you know why?
Did they...?
Did the leads come in yet?
Oh, God, I hate this job.
...how can you talk to me that... that...
...that's why I came in.  I thought I...
That's what, that's what, that's what I was trying to do.  That's why I came in...I meet gestapo tac...
Mmm.
Fuck insured.  You owe me a car.
Listen to me, the statute, it's for your protection.  I have no complaints with that, in fact, I was a member of the board when we drafted it, so quite the opposite. It says that you can change your mind three working days from the time the deal is closed.
Roma, would you, I'd like to get some lunch...
You stupid fucking cunt.  You, Williamson...I'm talking to you, shithead...You just cost me six thousand dollars.  Six thousand dollars.  And one Cadillac.  That's right.  What are you going to do about it?  What are you goin to do about it, asshole. You fucking shit.  Where did you learn your trade.  You stupid fucking cunt.  You idiot.  Whoever told you you could work with men?
Mr. Levene...?
Four.  You had four leads.  One kicked out, one the judge, you say...
...no...
What is this "you say"?  A deal kicks out...I got to eat.  Shit, Williamson, shit.  You...Moss... Roma...look at the sheets...look at the sheets.  Nineteen eighty, eighty-one...eighty-two...six months of eighty-two...who's there? Who's up there?
Under him?
...it isn't you...?  Who is it? Who is this I'm talking to?  I need the leads...
Marshal the leads...marshal the leads?  What the fuck, what bus did you get off of, we're here to fucking sell.  Fuck marshaling the leads.  What the fuck talk is that? What the fuck talk is that?  Where did you learn that?  In school?  That's "talk," my friend, that's "talk." Our job is to sell.  I'm the man to sell.  I'm getting garbage.  You're giving it to me, and what I'm saying is it's fucked.
Then put me on the board.
I will close.  John, John, ten percent.  I can get hot.  You know that...
No.
Well, I want to tell you something, fella, wasn't long I could pick up the phone, call Murray and I'd have your job.  You know that?  Not too long ago.  For what?  For nothing. "Mur, this new kid burns my ass." "Shelly, he's out." You're gone before I'm back from lunch.  I bought him a trip to Bermuda once...
Wait.  Alright.  Fine.  The one.  Give me the lead.  Give me the one lead.  The best one you have.
What happened?
The only thing remarkable is who you made it to.
What are you trying to tell me?
You robbed the office.
It was his idea.
Abso...
Their check's no good?  They're nuts...?
Williamson, get on the phone, call Mitch...
When?
Fuck you, Dave...
Fuck you care...?
How was it...?
The only arrangement I'll accept is full investment.  Period.  The whole eight units.  I know that you're saying 'be safe,' I know what you're saying.  I know if I left you to yourselves, you'd say 'come back tomorrow,' and when I walked out that door, you'd make a cup of coffee...you'd sit down...and you'd think 'let's be safe...' and not to disappoint me you'd go one unit or maybe two, because you'd become scared because you'd met possibility.  But this won't do, and that's not the subject..." Listen to this, I actually said this. "That's not the subject of our evening together." Now I handed them the pen.  I held it in my hand. I turned the contract, eight units eighty-two grand. "Now I want you to sign."  I sat there.  Five minutes.  Then, I sat there, Ricky, twenty-two minutes by the kitchen clock.  Twenty-two minutes by the kitchen clock.  Not a word, not a motion. What am I thinking? "My arm's getting tired?" No.  I did it.  I did it.  Like in the old says, Ricky.  Like I was taught... Like, like, like I used to do...I did it.
I own the property, my mother owns the property, I put her into it. I'm going to show you on the plats. You look when you get home A-3 through A-14 and 26 through 30. You take your time and if you still feel.
No...Black Creek.  Yes.  In Florida?
My wife told me to look into...
"Home Cooking"...what did you call it, you said it...it was a tag phrase that you had,,,
Yes.  Is this something that I can talk ab...
Oh!  My God...I've got to get you on the plane!
Rick...
I've got to talk to you...
My wife said I have to cancel the deal.
No, I don't know.  Tell me.
No, I'm saying you don't include Saturday...in your three days. It's not a business day.
What would have elapsed?
When did you write the check?
And when was that check cashed?
I'm very sorry, Jimmy.  I apologize to you.
...what, what, say it.  Say it to me...
To negotiate what?  To negotiate what?
What?  What?  What, Jim: I tell you what, let's get out of here...let's go get a drink.
What are the police doing?
Cop couldn't find his dick two hands and a map.  Anyone talks to this guy's an asshole...
Eight units.  Mountain View.
I'll show you how to chew it." Your pal closes, all that comes out of your mouth is bile, how fucked up you are...
Have a good trip.
They got, listen to me...
Where are you going?
What's the fucking point in any case...?  What's the point.  I got to argue with you, I got to knock heads with the cops, I'm busting my balls, sell you dirt to fucking deadbeats money in the mattress, I come back you can't even manage to keep the contracts safe, I have to go back and close them again...What the fuck am I wasting my time, fuck this shit.  I'm going out and reclose last week's...
Are you alright?
Do you like them?
On your pillow.
I can help you.
What took so long?
Do you think he'd be satisfied with the two hundred dollars?  I think he would.
How are you, honey?  You've met Merle, haven't you.  He was with me in Vegas.
The ink on your divorce isn't dry. Your children see you on weekends; your oldest boy, Michael Francis... was in some trouble with the Reno police over some petty theft that you don't even know about.
I want to talk to you, Michael.
Whatsamatter, you don't want me to dance with him 'cause he's a man!
I don't want to stay here...
Would you like some?
Anyone not in your family, is a stranger.  Believe me, when trouble comes, your country won't take care of you.
I think there's only two hundred dollars under my hat.  I'm right.  Only two hundred dollars.
My life won't be worth a nickel after tomorrow.
Why'd you do it, Frankie?  After all these years, why'd you turn against him?
Who's that?  Pentangeli?  Frankie &quot;Five-Angels&quot;...thought you were never coming West.
I never met them.
Mike, I got something special up my sleeve for these boys.  You ever hear of &quot;Superman?&quot; And I don't mean the comic book.
Mikey, why would they ever hit poor old Frankie Five-Angels?  I loved that ole sonuvabitch.  I remember when he was just a 'button,' when we were kids.  We used to put bedsheets on our heads, you know, like we were ghosts.  An' ole Frankie come peek into our room, we'd jump up, and he'd always pretend like he was really scared. You remember?
&quot;Yo soy un hombre sincero...&quot; I am a sincere man, From the land of the palms...
The song.  Are you sincere with me, Fredo?
For you, she is beautiful.  For me, there is only my wife!
I wish they had.  He takes fifty dollars a week from my father's cash drawer.  But you can't kill a man like Fanucci.
Kay, Michael didn't tell me a lot; and what he did tell me, I can't repeat.  But the responsibility for you and the kids was the most important thing he left me with.
Hello?
Why didn't someone tell me!
Rocco!
If you need anything, just...
Mikey, I hoped...
Did the boy get something from me for Christmas?
I want you to reach Fredo.  I know he's scared, but have one of our people reach him.  Assure him that there will be no reprisals.  Tell him that I know Roth misled him.
What is it, can't you give me straight answers anymore!
He's been dying of the same heart attack for twenty years.
Everything is going to be okay, Frankie, don't worry.
You're right.
Frankie, you were always interested in politics, in history.  I remember you talking about Hitler back in '43.  We were young then.
Don't worry about anything, Frankie Five-Angels.
What the hell are you talking about?
No one can trace anything to me; I pride myself on that.
This committee owes an apology!
Yes.
Anthony, Daddy's busy.
Why too late?
On a plane back to Sicily.
That's all.  You see, in Sicily, in the old days... there was only one legitimate reason to kill a blood relative... only one.  IF he was a traitor.
There are still things I have to do.
You're a considerate young man.
However I can help you...
We do favors for each other...
I still don't speak Spanish, Michael.
If only I could live to see it, kid; to be there with you.  How beautifully we've done it, step by step.  Here, protected, free to make our profits without the Justice Department, the FBI; ninety miles away in partnership with a friendly government.  Ninety miles, just a small step, looking for a man who desperately wants to be President of the United States, and having the cash to make it possible.
This doubles my investment.
Terrible.  I'd give twice this amount to take a piss without it hurting.
You know my lawyer, Tom Hagen. Johnny Ola.
They asked him to sign paper to take down the markers; but he got mad; told them to wait until he was finished.
How can you be fair with animals? They recruit niggers and spicks; they do violence in their own Grandmother's neighborhoods.  And everything is dope and whores; the gambling is left to last.  Let me run my family without you on my back.  I want them taken care of.
You give your loyalty to a Jew over your own blood.
I know.
This was my father's old study. When I was a kid, we had to be quiet when we played near here. When I was older, I learned many things from him here.  I was happy that this house never went to strangers; first Clemenza took it over, and then you.  My father taught me, in this room, never to act until you know everything that's behind things.  Never.  If Hyman Roth sees that I interceded with you in the Rosato Brothers' favor, he'll think his relationship with me is still sound.  I'm going somewhere to meet him tomorrow.  We have friends in some very important business that we're making.  Do this for me; you make the peace with the Rosato Brothers on their terms.  Let the word out that I forced you; you're not happy wit hit, but acquiesced, just because of me.  It will get back to Hyman Roth.  Do this, Frankie.  You can trust me.
Your family all seem to be okay in the other houses; your Mother's still sleeping.
We could have talked first, saved a lot of running around.
Don't I look like I'm listening?
What if I say shove it?
You know if there's a way I'll go to the commission and the commission will side with me.  That puts me and the other New York families against you.
I'm talking about Italians!
He supports me.
Thanks, doll.
These old movies are such a hoot. They thought they were being scary, but they're just funny.
I've gotten to know someone who's famous.
What's that mean?
I wasn't going to try anything.
Yeah, I'm a good man.  Something make you think I'm not?
Gimme a break.  I'm going to sit on my ass while he draws pictures.  Is that going to hurt him?
Got a lawn this afternoon, but I'm free until then.
No.  You are a guest now.  You go in the living room.
How long you worked for Mr. Whale?
You mean family?  All in Joplin, Missouri.
I'm not married.
Yeah?  What's your husband do?
You and he are not doing things?
Good.  That is what I hope.  I did not think you a bugger too.  I fear only that you might hurt him if he tries.
It's not what you think.
Take care of Mr. Whale like he was your flesh and blood.
Do you want to be questioned about you and Mr. Jimmy?  Please, Clayton.  It will be better if I find the body alone.
Good morning.
My name is Whale.  This is my house.
I couldn't help but notice your tattoo.  That phrase?  Death Before Dishonor.  What does it mean?
Getting to be a warm day.  A scorcher, as you Yanks call it.
Or would you prefer a beer?
Sure, everybody does.  When I was a kid I'd go with my sister twice a week.  Why?  Were you an actor or something?
Still.  You must be rich.  Making a couple of famous movies like those.
You have the most architectural skull.  And your nose.  Very expressive.
All right then.  Sure.  I could use the extra dough.
That shirt, Mr. Boone.
I'm sorry.  It's too white, too distracting.  Would it be asking too much for you to take it off?
Would you be more comfortable barefoot?  Feel free to remove your boots and socks.
No, you were middle class, like all Americans.
I liked it.  We all did.
Just a trim.  And mine while you're at it.  Fingers are a bit stiff today.
Can I see what you did so far?
Oh dear.  I <u>have</u> made you nervous.
Mr. Boone.  You're not due to cut the lawn until Wednesday.
I'm curious, Mr. Boone.  What convinced you to come back?
My apologies.  I had no business snapping at you.
If you don't mind driving, I'd like to take you as my guest.  There should be lots of pretty starlets to keep you amused.
Very good, Clayton.  May I call you Clayton?  Or do you prefer Boone?
That only leaves the rest.
Sorry.  My pajamas are tailored. Would it be too distressing to continue with the towel?  No more immodest than a kilt, you know.
My old man was a Marine.  He enlisted the day he turned seventeen.
The morning after Pearl Harbor, he drove down to St. Louis to reenlist.  He was so damn excited. World War II was going to be his second chance.  They told him he was too old...fat ...nearsighted.  Said he'd be more use to his country if he stayed home and looked after his family.
Storm's getting worse.
All right.  Let's take it off now.
I'm not that way.  Get it through your fucking head.  I don't want to mess with you.
Wait until I tell my friends I had you naked in my arms.  Won't they be surprised?
Did I hurt you?
I can undress myself, thank you.
I'm up.  Thanks.
Hey, Boone.
Go home, Clay.  We're closing up.
She tells me you haven't been sleeping well.
I did.  But Princess Margaret was a doll.  We're all equals in her eyes.  As commoners, I presume.
Jimmy, there are people here I need to speak to.  You'll be fine on your own?
And you said there'd be some of me left.  Nobody's going to know me in this getup.
Hanna?  Who's the new yardman?
Which ones?  I bring them all.
Oh, that monster.  How could you be working with him?
She is horrible.
You will take them all, Mr. Jimmy?
That is my daughter.  She say she and her husband are coming to town this afternoon.  I am sorry, Mr. Jimmy.  I will make it short.
Mr. Whale, this is such an honor. You're one of my favorite all-time directors.  I can't believe I'm meeting you.
That's my favorite line in my favorite movie of yours.  "Bride of Frankenstein."
You're serious.
Then the rumors are true?
You, Mr. Kay?  How do you know George Cukor?
I commend you.  If you're going to pursue poofs, go after those who can do favors for you.  You waste everybody's time when you court dinosaurs.
How are you?
What about?
It's been a long time, Memphis --
Six years. Shit. Time flies, don't it? Six years ago we were fartin' through Armani and pissin' Cristal. Now look at us ...
A boost. A big boost ...
Who was the job for?
Fish.
You have a Hollandaise sauce ?
Speak for yourself, boss I don't have a Hollandaise sauce
Yeah -- ?
It's about my brother ... Kip...
I don't want them hurt. Any of 'em...
You should never have gotten my brother and his friends involved ...
Well, now, he's clear. And you'll stay away from him...
Well, that certainly won't do.
They just brought in Donny Astricky. Shot by a jacker ...
You want to come along quiet?
I know you.
And this has what to do with me?
What do you want from me?
Who is it -- ?
Got it ...
Diane 1.
You ever feel bad about any of this?
You guys have any skills at all?
What color?
All I get are the Orientals. They can build 'em, but they can't drive 'em So? What are you doing here? What's with the outfit -- ?
Eleanor is Memphis' "unicorn."
How's it going -- ?
A bunch of strung-out hypes and stick- up men. This ain't like the old days, Memphis. The profession has lost its..
oh.
He doesn't return my calls. or my letters ...
Yes. can you hold, sir -- ?
Breakfast brunch -- ?
Whatcha got left ... ?
It looks just like a regular Mustang --
You all right -- ?
All my enemies own car crushers. It's like a pre-requisite ... Owwww...
You're kind of cultivating a new look.
Hey, you want something to eat ?
What happened to you?
You can handle it?
You don't think so, huh?
You hear me?
That's strange. I'm nervous. Donny's nervous. Everyone's nervous. But not you...
Come here --
Toby...
Shit ...
Jim Rockford. ROCKFORD FILES.
You still wrenching at Bacchiochi's?
"Mitch?"
So I was replaced by Mitch?
And here I am...
What the hell are you doing -- ?
Hey.
They only made a handful. We're lucky there's even one living in the area...
She's trouble --
You mentioned that in your letters
Cos there were those dark days, when I figured - my God, how easy it was for him to just give it up; to make the deal; take the rot for the whole crew ... And give me up in the process.
What the hell's that -- ?
She was so great, why'd you leave her?
Arright ... Enough ... I can't have you bellying up to my heart again, man, f you can't help falling off the stool. But he puts his mouth to her ears ...
Stop. What about Maserati Boy?
With a twist of my wrist ... You're turned over ...
Hear you roar ...
You think it can be done?
Tell me...
I remember I had a 1964 Buick Opal. worst car ever built. Value job. Everything broke and I-fixed it. A coma car - built to German specs. Plastic gas line. 3 speedometer head. On a quiet night, you could hear it rusting in the garage. But when that car was gone, I missed it. If it came driving back in here right now, there'd be tears and laughter ...
Some crew you got ...
You need him...
Okay, then... Otto?
Hey, Memphis. Remember me? Toby Walker. I live next door ...
I logged outside the G.R.A.B. site, right? Then I monitored their incoming outside data requests, right? Then I got these ISDN numbers, right? Then I tracked them back, right? Then I took the one I could jack-up the easiest, right? Then I called back see, they think I'm an insurance company - that's where it looks like I'm coming from -- and they're sharing stats with this insurance company, right? So now they're sharing it with me, right? They think I'm looking for stats for an actuarial conference on auto-theft. So they let me in, right? Give me all these numbers. But then I don't leave, right? I'm in. I've got the key. Now I just go anywhere I want.
How come ... ?
There's excessive resistance in the cranking circuit ... You know what you gotta do -- ?
Why don't you leave him alone?
But he was always a bad kid, that one.
Hey, look at him. Tommy. You grew up.
Just stay away from the garbage. Yon know what I mean.
I know what you did inside. You did what you had to do. I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking from now on, outside. I'm talking right here.
I'm not going to get fucked like Gribbs. He's seventy years old and the fucking guy is going to die in prison.  I don't need that. I don't care who it is. I'm warning everybody. Gribbs got twenty years just because he said hello to some fuck who was sneaking around selling junk behind his back. That's not going to happen to me.  You understand?
Right in my face. You looked in my face and you lied.
Talk? To you? After what you did!
Henry.  Wake up.
You son of a bitch. She's been here.
Stop! Stop!
Yes, you can. I've got it set up. We'll be fine. All I need is for you to keep bringing the stuff. I've got a guy in here from Pittsburgh who'll move it for me. Believe me, in a month we'll be fine. We won't need anybody.
Get packed.  We're getting out of here.
Who's gonna do that?
What are you talking about?
I flushed it down the toilet.
What are we going to do with him? We can't dump him in the street.
What'll I tell Fran?
It's that rat bastard from Pittsburgh. He ratted you all out. He's been a rat since he got busted in Pittsburgh.
I You wasted eight fucking aprons on that guy. :
You ready?
Tommy.  Come on. Relax.
You gotta help me. Okay? This girl I told you about? Diana? She's from the Five Towns. She's Jewish. She won't go out with me alone. Can you believe this shit? She's fucking prejudiced, but she's built. She's never been out with an Italian before. She says she'll only go out on a double date with her girlfriend.  You believe this shit? But you gotta see her. I mean, she's beautiful.
Is it my fault she won't go out without her girlfriend?  For Chrissake.  Come on.  You don't even have to stay.  Jeesuz!  What's the big deal?
What kind of person doesn't call?
You?  You think you're the only one?  I've talked to them a million times, but they don't listen.
Someday they'll get what's coming to them. That's the only way they'll stop.
You guys know my cousin Mikey Sullivan?
Submit, bitch! Submit! Submit!
Yeah, so he's like "Check the front of my truck, I can prove I hit it 'cause there's probably some blood or something"--
Who'd you call?
I don't know what the fuck you're doin'. You're givin' us a ride.
Sorry, brother.  I don't know what to tell ya. You know all the girls I been with. You been with 'em too, except for Cheryl McGovern which was a big mistake on your part brother...
Suck my crank. Fuckin' sheet metal pussy.  So, when are you done with those meetin's?
Are they hookin' you up with a job?
Okay.
Oh...
Yah, that is a nice ass.
Did she get my Double Burger?
My uncle can probably get you on my demo team.
Some other guy?
Did your Uncle get arrested?
Hey, asshole. Happy Birthday.
I'm not sure--
So why do you think I should work for the National Security Agency?
No, there's a limit.
Please, I'm a professor here and it's very important.
What's that?
--That edge!
Shall we start the, uh...
Oh, for God's sake, Will.
This is correct. I see you used Mclullen here--
--This can't be right.  This is going to be very embarrassing. Have you ever considered--
Then don't set up any more meetings.
--You know how fuckin' easy this is to me? This is a joke!  And I'm sorry you can't do this. I really am. 'Cause if you could I wouldn't be forced to watch you fumble around and fuck it up.
Well, I'm sorry.
So who won the bet?
You were missed.  How long has it been since we've seen each other?
I've been busy, Gerry. I got a full schedule.
I got it.
Any vulnerability he senses, he'll exploit.
Would you excuse us?
You moved?
Jobs doing what?
He married his cousin.
Sean, this is important. And it's above personal rivalry--
Look, you took one road and I took another. That's fine.
Look Sean, I don't care if you have a rapport with the boy-- I don't care if you have a few laughs-- even at my expense! But don't you dare undermine what I'm trying to do here.
Oh, come on, Sean--
Yes you do. You're angry at me for doing what you could have done. Ask yourself if you want Will to feel that way for the rest of his life, to feel like a failure.
Hello, Sean.
So I hear you're taking some time.
How about one now?
What should I do?
So, you finally got a job Morgan?
No, but, I mean you know...I do other things. That no one knows about.
Probably not.
Free weights. WILL Oh yeah? Me too. What do you bench?
Yeah. Do you paint?
Why thank you.
Well, are you going out again?
Why not?
My wife's dead.
Really? How'd the date go? WILL Do you still counsel veterans?  I read your book last night.
Well, I've read you colleagues. Your book was good, Sean.  All those guys were in your platoon?
So wait a minute. The Red Sox haven't won a World Series since nineteen eighteen, you slept out for tickets, games gonna start in twenty minutes, in walks a girl you never seen before, and you give your ticket away?
Gerry says the meeting went well.
What did you think?
Someone who challenges you in every way. Who takes you places, opens things up for you. A soul-mate.
What?
Well, I'm here.  So, is that my problem? I'm afraid of being abandoned? That was easy.
Oh, this is your file. I have to send it back to the Judge with my evaluation.
Twenty years of counselling you see a lot of--
The wrench, why?
I know.
That's what you want?
I'll keep in touch.
I was trying to be smooth.  But at twelve-fifteen I was gonna come over there and talk to you.
Now, I'm gonna make all these caramels disappear.
I really don't 'date' that much.
I bet you have a great family.
I have twelve big brothers.
Yup, you're lookin' at lucky thirteen.
I swear to God.
It was great. There was always someone to play with, give you advice.
Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry, Mikey, Davey, Timmy, Tommy, Joey, Robby, Johnny, and Brian.
I want to meet them.
Didn't your mother ever tell you not to look a gift horse n the mouth?
I've never seen your place.
What about your friends? Or your brothers? When do I get to meet them?
You men are shameful. If you're not thinking of your weiner then you're acting on its behalf.
Why is it important to you? If I inherited all that money, the only thing important to me would be workin' on my swing.
Well all right, Beethoven. He looked at a piano and saw music. The fuckin' guy was deaf when he composed the Ode to Joy. They had to turn him around to take a bow because he couldn't hear the crowd going crazy behind him. Stone deaf. He saw all of that music in his head.
Then what are you afraid of?
Yes, Will. I didn't even know that?
All right, mister. I'll go. You just show your license to contrack, an' then you make out a order--where an' when an' how much you gonna pay--an' you sign it an' we'll go.
Twicet now I've fell for that line. Maybe he needs a thousan' men. So he get's five thousan' there, an' he'll pay fifteen cents a hour. An' you guys'll have to take it 'cause you'll be hungry.  'F he wants to hire men, let him write it out an' say what he's gonna pay. Ast to see his license. He ain't allowed by law to contrack men without a license.
I'd come back--
But it ain't runnin' away, Ma. All I wanta do is go away with another fella an' look aroun' for work by ourself--
Ready, Ma?
That comes from not holdin' you tight *enough.*
Lots must a died, too.
Any gas?
Kinda pie y'got?
Want to work?
How many men?
House 25. Number's on the door.
Two and a half cents.
Deputy sheriffs.
We got five sanitary units. Each one elects a central committee man. They make the laws, an' what they say goes.
*You* find out, I can't.
That cut you got?
Course I'll say grace if somebody sets out the food--  --but my heart ain't in it.  Nice drinkin' liquor.
Ain't you seen your folks since then?
This used to be mine. I give it to Grampa when I went away.  You reckon they could be dead?
This is Muley Graves.  You remember the preacher, don't you?
How about us? Is that the truth for us?
Gimme that gun. Now git outa here. Go down in them willows an' wait.
You ain't--you ain't sorry, are you, honey?
They shore don't waste no time!  Take her out.
Sure do.
What's the matter? What's happened?
For three dollars a day, that's what I'm doin' it for. I got two little kids. I got a wife and my wife's mother. Them people got to eat. Fust and on'y thing I got to think about is my own folks. What happens to other folks is their lookout.
I seen your hands. You been swinging a pick or a sledge--that shines up your hands. I notice little things like that all the time.  Got a trade?
I didn't mean nothing.
Workin'. Pickin' peaches. But I seen a bunch a fellas yellin' when we come in, so I come out to see what's goin' on. What's it all about?
You know what I al'ays said: "Tom'll come bustin' outa that jail like a bull through a corral fence." Can't keep no Joad in jail!
*Ain't* a-goin'... ain't a-goin'...
How long you plan to be in Arizona?
Don't it ever scare you it won't be nice in California like we think?
We gonna live here?
I like the tent better.
Anybody ask anything?
Ma... you know, if Connie was here I wouldn't min' any a this.
You an' me's goin' together--jus' you an' me. We're a-goin' to that dance an' we're a-goin' to jus' set an' watch. If anybody says to come dance--why I'll say you're poorly. But you an' me, we're gonna hear the music an' see the fun.
Make her easy, John. Watch her.
Muley tol' me what happened, Ma. Are we goin' to California true?
And they's some coffee here. I could fix him a cup...
Look, Ma!
I'm a-tryin', Ma. Honest I am.
That ain't the way they're tellin' it. They're sayin' you done it fust.
Tom! They's a whole lot I don't understan', but goin' away ain't gonna ease us.  They was the time when we was on the lan'. They was a bound'ry to us then. Ol' folks died off, an' little fellas come, an' we was always one thing-- we was the fambly--kinda whole an' clear. But now we ain't clear no more. They ain't nothin' keeps us clear. Al--he's a-hankerin' an' a- jibbitin' to go off on his own. An' Uncle John is just a-draggin' along. Pa's lost his place--he ain't the head no more. We're crackin' up, Tom. They ain't no fambly now. Rosasharn--  --she gonna have her baby, but *it* ain't gonna have no fambly. I been tryin' to keep her goin' but--Winfiel'-- what's he gonna be, this-a-way? Growin' up wild, an' Ruthie, too-- like animals. Got nothin' to trus'. Don't go Tom. Stay an' help. Help me.
She's gettin' prettier, Ma.
They was some cops here, Ma. They was takin' down the license numbers. It looks like somebody knows sump'n.
I know you would, Ma. But I ain't gonna let you. You hide somebody that's kilt a man an'... an' you'd be in trouble too.
This here's a fifteen-cent loaf.
You can have this for ten cents.
All you got to do is lay down an' watch.
That's Connie Rivers with her. They're married now.  She's due about three-four months.
I figger best we leave something like this on him, lest somebody dig him up and make out he been kilt.  Lotta times looks like the gov'ment got more interest in a dead man than a live one.
Maybe it's nice on the other side. Them pitchers--them little pos'cards-- they was real pretty.
Cut it out, Pa. He'p Al with the truck.  Don't fret, honey. You goin' to be awright.
Lemme go! I didn't go to do it!
What's these?
But wait. I still don't understand what you do.
Welcome back! I'm Arlene Oslott- Joseph.
So, what are you doing now?
Bob. Bob Destephano.
Jesus...
So you eat-- read it everyday?
How long has it been?
That's part of it.
Okay. Let's catch up. You go first.
Flowers. That's funny.
Even though I left, you never left me. Not just memory but a substance in my blood.
He was trying to kill you, right!
Like, that there's a point? An organic connection between all living things.
What if I come back?
How do you know?
Go to your reunion, Martin. See those people and discover what they mean to you. Try not to kill anybody for a few days, see how you feel.
...I am at home with the me. I am rooted in me, who is on this adventure.
Do you like the people you work with?
What do you want?
It's okay. It's Martin The door begins to open revealing Debi and Newberry.
...How about I sell you two rounds for a hundred grand a piece?
Hello, Bob.
I'm an attorney. I'm with Moss, Brice & Fromeyer.
The more things change, the more they Goddamned well stay the same.
You always say that. You always say that. I'm telling you, you never met the man.
Here's the news: He hasn't been in Portugal since '90. I know that from the file. Why don't you read the file, man?
Why don't we just do his job then, so we can do our job, and get the fuck out of here.
So if we do his job, we're the bad guys. If we do our job, we're the good guys.
Throw that away.
They're not happy, sir.
You have.
We had a good laugh, didn't we?
Why don't you return this car and borrow mine? Have Debi follow you to the rent-a-car so you can get a ride back.
Marty! It's me. Paul.
So what happened to you?
Well, if you could just come for the day. New York's only a few hours by plane, I'd have you home by dinner...
Oh no. She's here. I brought him along. And my daughter, too. We're staying at Peterson's...
Shit.
Poor thing.
Is this how you're going to make me pay my phone bill?
Relax our center... It's just sitting in a bucket.
Actually, I never rode Western. I'm sorry. Go ahead.
How did you meet her?
Why didn't it work out?
Ever think of moving there full time?
Everything under control?
Now, listen. I want you to stand on him.
Liz is taking care of him.  The doctor said the sooner you start therapy the better the chances are you can --
Why don't you go lie down?
No, I don't mean you have to. It's just that we may not have enough --
Fine!
That's not true! Whatever problems your father and I are having, have nothing to do with this.
Did he tell you that?
It's... it's not that simple to explain. I know you think it is, but it's not. The truth is, I don't really know what I want to do. I don't have all the answers.
What would they say? "Ten miles to big rock." "Twenty miles to bigger rock."
Does anybody out there want something to drink?
I don't deserve that. I have never looked at you as a disappointment. If I'm on your back to do better, if I push you to try harder it's because I want you to be the best you can be.
Who is it?
Smokey told me he left last night to look at some horses in Sheriden. He won't be back for three days. I can't believe he didn't want to say goodbye.
Great!
David?
Yes. We're suing.
Aw... that's so sweet.
What was I saying?
That's the craziest thing I ever heard. Absolutely not.
You want to do this by yourself? How? You can't take care of Pilgrim all the --
And you think it's best if I don't come.
When are you coming home?
How are you feeling about work?
Was the trip okay?
I have so much to tell you.
Thank you. You're all doing too much.
But, uh, Egypt is, well, it's like nothing else. It's like going back in time.  I remember as a kid trying to imagine what a kid my age, centuries ago, walking over that same ground, was wondering about or, if they had the same problems as me... and I felt, connected to... to time itself, almost. Ha, I never realized how hard it was to describe.
They fired you?
Did you always know this was the life you wanted?
I don't think anybody can make Tom do anything he didn't want.
Annie, it's Liz. How's Grace?
Liz, listen, the Doctor's here and I just can't, uh... talk now... so --
Play that sweet one you know. The one makes my wife here so friendly.
I don't believe they'll expect that.
He says if you do it soon as they're born, it makes them real easy to handle later on.
I don't believe it.
We thought we lost him in the snow storm... Told the kids. Had a funeral for the damn thing. Finally, snow stops. Staring to warm up. I go out and start cleaning the truck... Goddamn if that dog doesn't jump out from the back seat covered in snow... I nearly stained myself.
Can you drive?
Just follow this. Nothing to it. I'm going to shut my eyes here for a little while. Just keep going till you run out of road.
There's still something going on inside of him I can't reach. So me and Smokey here, we're going to try laying him down. Okay?
It's warmer than I thought.
"... and I said that"...
Jude, you okay?
Do you want something else, honey? We order something else?
Did you notice -- no cane?
IT WAS MY TURN!
Well, like I told your wife, it's really up to Pilgrim.
You're looking fit.
You know, Rona, we weren't all that good together even when we were good together.
Well... Dale... you know, a lot of this stuff... it just... nuts and bolts.
Cool?
In English, please. I didn't spend ten years protecting the president so I could finish my career feeling like an idiot.
Good. Good man. Alright, let's finish up here, and take him in for interrogation.
And never again have to pay for a service that would be dirt cheap...
What?
Active matrix, man. A million psychedelic colors. Man, baby, sweet, ooo!
Hold on a second!
Oh man. That's universally stupid, man!
Ta-da!
Damn!
Yeah but don't forget God. System operators love to use God. It's that whole male ego thing.
Oh yeah, you want a seriously righteous hack, you score one of those Gibsons man. You know, supercomputers they use to like, do physics, and look for oil and stuff?
Oh wow, we are fried.
You heard of a hacker called Acid Burn? You know who he is?
Due to Mr. Gill's untimely demise and everything, I guess you two will have to improvise the next round.
Can I cut the electricity to his room so he'll sleep normal hours? He's been playing with his computer all night for a solid week.  Well yes, he could be playing with himself. Mmm hmm. Yes I'll ask. Dade, you like girls, don't you?
You haven't been doing anything stupid, right, Dade?  Right, Dade?!
How was school?
Aaaah. Did we meet someone special?
Right. Anything else, you want me to mow the lawn? Oops, forgot. New York. No grass.
Talk to me.
That's Razor and Blade.
Two days.
Here's your class.
It has a killer refresh rate.
Yeah.
You what?
A virus called Da Vinci will cause oil spills at 10:30 AM Eastern Time tomorrow.
You look good in a dress.
Security, uh Norm, Norm speaking.
Yeah, I'm sorry, I was just looking for the principal's office.
Did you find the program for the virus on any of the discs we confiscated?
Good.
You're welcome.
I need a handle, man. I don't have an identity until I have a handle.
Big deal. A garbage file's got shit in it, Joey, come on.
Joey, a garbage file holds miscellaneous data. Junk. Bits of stuff that's been erased, man.
Hey! What are you guys doing in here?
What is he doing in here?
Any questions?
Yeah, ha, hell of a night huh?
Rachel! What are you doing here? I thought I was supposed to pick you up?
When did you find this out?
I am different, it's just that I just got pissed off...that's all.
Brady!
It's hard to tell, there all chewed up.
Can't you find somebody else?
How do we look?
We'll be at the Fallbrooks. The number's next to the phone.
Why not?
Yes.
Night Doc.
What is this? Four nights in a row?  You going for a record here?  The seven year olds insomniacs hall of fame?
Jamie, sometimes it's...
It's been eleven months.
Sure it is. I think tonight Brady was ready to make a commitment.  But now my future relationship, my engagement, my marriage, my children, your grandchildren, have all been wiped out because I have to baby sit tonight.
Well tonight we're going to do something better. We're going to go trick-or-treating.
How about this afternoon I pick you up from school and we go get ice cream?
Hi.
The Discount Mart. Can we get Ice Cream after?
What?
Rachel, can I go get my costume on?
Had enough?
Rachel come on.
You remember Lindsay don't you?
You know Rach, Discount Mart is having a sale on Halloween costumes.
I know! Don't you want to talk to him?
You won't look pushy.
Where are you going?
You got your riot gun?
Something?
How can a man do this Loomis? Tell me.
These kids aren't likely to forget.
How far are you going, Mr. Sayer?
Sheriff Meeker, we killed him.
Hi, Annie, Laurie...
Sure.
I'M baby sitting for the Doyles. It's only three houses away. We can keep each other company.
Hello?
I thought it was an obscene phone call.
You still spooked?
Lies.
I hate that dog. I'm the only person in the world he doesn't like.
What would you say if I told you that you were going to the Homecoming Dance tomorrow night?
Fancy.
I'm glad you're here because I have something I want you to do. I want you to call up Ben Tramer and tell him you were just fooling around.
I'm scared.
Want a beer?
I'd like to talk to you, if I could.
Come on... A skunk could have killed it...
They could be.
Where?
Annie, some day you're going to get us all in deep trouble.
Hi, Laurie, what's up?
Can we make Jack-O-Lanterns?
Laurie...
Richie said he was coming after me tonight.
I saw the bogyman. I saw him outside.
Who is it?
How?
Yes, she is.
There's nothing else I can do.
Sam, Haddonfield is a hundred and fifty miles from here. How could he get there? He can't drive.
Thorazin.
Ever done anything like this before?
Oh, good...
Hm-mm.  Oh, yeah.  I met Phil.
And the quail is responsible for the quail eggs.
Hi.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
We're a big hit.
Oh!
Oh, geez, yeah.
We got that idea on that trip to Paris.
Hmm?
I gave blood before and, uh... clothing to the poor.
We saw, um, Pavarotti, eh, uh, in Ernani at the Met, and I cried...
Y-you live in Chelsea, don't you?
So what's the, uh, problem this time?
Now I ca-can't remember.
You've had some dizzy spells.  What about ringing and buzzing? Have you, uh, noticed any of that?
How ya doin', man?
Are you excited about becoming a collector? DUSTY Yeah.
...with the affiliates.
We--
Yeah.
How about you?
I'll never understand it.  You're so bright and charming and beautiful.
No!  No...
Yeah.  How are you?
Fine.  Oh, we went to the Caravaggio exhibition at the Met.  It's such a treat to go through a museum with Frederick.  I mean...you learn so much.  Do you like Caravaggio?
e.e. cummings.  I'd like to get you this.
I-I read a poem of you and thought of his last week.  A poem of  his and thought of you last--  You'll be fine, though.  Lee walks over to Elliot in the center aisle.  She looks at the book.
Page a hundred and twelve.
I figured I'd get, uh, Frederick and Dusty together.
Elliot!  Don't!
Wh--, uh, I know, I know but, I am in love with you.
Hannah and I are in the last stages.
W-well, please be candid.  I, I-I don't want you to feel bad.
O-o-o-okay, Lee.  Okay, okay.  You, you, y-you've said enough.  It's my responsibility now.  I will work things out.
Lee... uh...
I-I couldn't think where to invite you without taking risks.
You really do have those thoughts, don't you?
I know she must be a really passionate person.
Look, I'm just as much at fault.
Lee...
Great idea.
Are you in a bad mood?
Yes.  I know.  The last few weeks, you haven't been yourself.  And tonight at, tonight at dinner, you, you were kind of curt with me.
Yes, you were.  A-and when I, when I brought up the idea of having a baby, you just, you jumped down my throat.
Why do you say that?  Is there something wrong?
Well, tell me.  Should I be worried?
I want one with you.
Well, what?  What, wh-what are you not telling me?
Are you?
...this is a toast!  This is a toast.
Well, because I never thought of God in my life.  Now I'm giving it serious thought.
Because I got off to a wrong foot with my own thing, you know.  B-b- b-but I need a dramatic change in my life. FATHER  You're gonna believe in Jesus Christ?
But why?  We raised you as a Jew.
So?
Big.  Frederick, show him the oils.
Lucy and I kept talking, and I didn't realize how late it had gotten.
I don't know.  Cancer, I--
But you don't have any symptoms!
Yeah.  What?
No.
Maybe you need a few weeks in Bermuda, or something.  Or go to a whorehouse!  No?
Oh, will you stop attacking Hannah?!
What's the matter?  What's the matter with you?  You look pale.  You okay?
Glad you could put in an appearance.
Let me get a little reaction here.  How's Elliot?
Ohh!
Isn't that great?
Come on!  Hurry up!  Let's go!
Gee.
Okay, okay.
You admit that we're great cooks, right?
You know, I just want to look so good, but I don't want to seem, you know, like I'm overdressed.  You know what I'm saying? HANNAH  Oh, no, not at all.
Uh, you know, I think I can fake my way through a song.
Oh, gosh.
Well, that-that's good.  It just, uh...it just seems to me that-that six months or a year, if-if you spent it more productively...
Well, I don't know.  We'd uh, uh, um... Didn't Mom mention there was something...something at the Museum of Broadcasting?
Boy, I knew you'd be discouraging.
That's the point.  I'd like to be bothered.
Oh, why are you making those faces?
Oh, well, I cannot communicate with you!  I, you know, I never realized you were such a tightass. MICKEY I can't understand you.  Your sisters, both sisters have such good taste in music.  I don't know where you went, went wrong.
Thanks for a swell time.
Mmm, I don't know if you remember me, but we had the worst night of my life together.
...and I thought I'd come in and...and we could replay, uh, the whole, uh...
Good.  How are you?
Oh, well, that was a long time ago.
I may, I may have to get back into it, 'cause my accountant says that I'm running out of dollars. But...but, um, no, I haven't, I just sort of dropped out for a year...
You're okay, though, huh?
But you have to remember while you're reading and you're cursing my name, you know, that this is my first script.  Well, it's not my first script.
No, you can tell me straight.  It's okay.  Just, you know, tell me what you think.
Oh, wow!
Gosh, you really went through a crisis, you know that?  H-how did you get over it?  I mean, when I ran into you, you seemed, you seemed just perfectly fine.  Well, you seem fine now.
Um...look, there's something I've, uh, that's been bothering me for a long time, and I just thought I'd just tell you what it was and just sort of clear the deck here, and  that's this.
It's all right.
Thanks.
Yeah, well, she and an architect are now a very definite item, which I still cannot believe.
Oh, please!  We all came to have lunch, didn't we?
You're afraid of dying? MICKEY  Well...yeah, naturally.  Aren't you? I-- L-let me ask you, reincarnation, does that mean my soul would pass to another human being, or would I come back as a moose or an aardvark or something?
Uh-huh.
Well, okay.  Thank you very much.
We have to talk about <u>money</u>...
And?
...you haven't <u>found</u> him yet.
You've gone off to America, on your <u>Vacation</u>...
And now I have "dociled" you, have I not?  By forcing your obedience.
It's a poor workman who blames his tools.
...you...
...why?
That would adversely impact my income.
...why have they stuck you on this silly little roust?
<u>Who</u> are these guys...?
Well, if he hasn't, I'm vastly mistaken.
Evelda Drumgo.
C'mon, pal.
Doctore Carlo Fanelli, curator of the Pallazo Capponi, 2 months missing.
Where was the call from.
Make plans for Lechter's abduction.
What do you want me to do?
He don't like popcorn.
I like Popcorn...
Now, why in the world would he do that?
No, no, of course not.
No, I think he proffers to spend his happy hours with his playmates.
Oh, yes, what?  You'd <u>bribe</u> me, to, to, to, "release" you...?
And I expect you to.  Let's talk like two medical men
..suitcase...locker...
...fraid, that's about it, Doctor.
I could have acted on my own.  I was told...
Why would you say that?  Because he sent me in there to be killed...?  What <u>is</u> this...?
Look at this:
A fellow with five fingers.
No.
I am all attention.
What is that supposed to mean...?
What, you're saying she was overwrought.
Give it up, Evelda.
Give it up.
It is only temporary, until my confirmation by...
And?  Then?
Dr. Fell is studying for his examination by the Studiolo.
I'm not a scholar, Dottore.  But it seemed as if they, as if they...
...Franklin.
She's not the first foster that you've had.  <u>Is</u> she?
...they eat the dummy, sir, they eat the <u>man</u>... I keep them hungry.  When... when do we think this man arrives.
And you let her get away.
You find something objectionable to working in partnership with....
I realize, you're under a lot of....
You look lovely.
The girl could use some help.
...which of us is free...?
You want another drink, honey...?
What's that, Baby?
Our Mister <u>Frendler</u> to, to, to humiliate me, though....
You should get Married.
Because, baby, you're looking to find love in an institution, that's your only chance....
Yeah, well, it's a raw wound, innit, you're gonna bump it, every time you turn around... but you know what the <u>trick</u> is...?
Because you're going to help me plan a party.
Mr. Crawford asked my opinion.  Here we've got a purported x-ray, Dr. Lechter's surgery.  Do we keep it secret, or broadcast it?
...what...?
Trouble is, they all seem to <u>die</u>.
I am on the track of...
Because...?
I know where he is.
An Honor.  Carlo Pazzi....
But perhaps, there is some, some less radical solution.
Is it necessary to say of the sea that it is salt, that the stars are far, that...
Thank you.
...a Dr. Fell.  A Brazilian, I think. Applying for Fanelli's post.
Thirty thousand dollars reward.  In the whereabouts of Il Dottore Fanelli, or the apprehension of his...
..and <u>humiliation</u>?  What is this new job they've...?
Yes.  I think I <u>do</u>.  I think it is a phrase you used with that woman.  You told her you were an <u>orphan</u>.  You <u>used</u>, to your mind, your most private fears.
I saw a man today, a man so hideously deformed who'll spend his life in a hospital bbb...
If <u>he</u> could overcome... his need for... for self-<u>ratification</u>...
But... but....but.... you're <u>right</u>.  I used it.  To <u>bargain</u>.  For her <u>sympathy</u>...  I <u>used</u> it--to "whore myself out"--
...yes...?
And all he <u>left</u> us:  the Country brought back his <u>hat</u>, and his <u>badge</u>... both with a bullethole in them.  An' that's what he left us.  That's what I said.
Ah, yes, ah yes.  Our Doctor Lechter... And have they sent you, once again to <u>capture</u> him?  How terrible for you...
But, but that was before we started sharing stuff. Before I told you how I cried when Peepers died. I never told anyone that before.
You mean you didn't have any gay thoughts when you were my age...
Howdy Pouty.
I'm in the picture on Wendy's wall. Niagara Falls. Family trip. Little Wendy foreground. Me background. What are the odds on that one?
I couldn't tell her...it's, it's too major...Jesus, I'm starting to believe in God and what's worse I think I like the guy. The lightning bolt was just a test, right?  Wendy and I--we're meant to be. I'm right, right?  I have to see her...
Talia, don't go!
Mine!
Goodnight, Jasper.
Hello?!  What's in it for me?
Are we allowed to start hating "Wendy" yet..."Gee Wichita, I guess mosquitoes have always liked me."
Wendy, don't be afraid to get a little stupid and contagious. The kids don't understand that this is our summer, too. We shouldn't have to put our lives on hold to be their butlers.
College was entertaining, Wichita, but after 40 days and 40 nights of this, I really think we're going to get to know each...
I have to get up. Still more to do. That boy hates Asian people. That girl thinks she gave her Mom cancer by dropping a plate on her hand. Her daddy touches her. His daddy never touches him. It would have been cooler if I'd died.
Isn't this the time where one of us says something deeply offensive to the other one...We're just so different.
Hey.
When were you in Niagara Falls?
Todd was out there blocking the                             ] entrance. You would have been proud                         ] of me...My suit of armor is starting to come off. Not all of it, but enough to walk around...

Iunno.  Of course I believe you.

Ronnie, I'm still a virgin.
All right.
Let me get it clear, Veronica. You want yourself a sweet homeboy for this T.V. show so you can show everybody what a loose, Martin Luther Cosby-lovng place Westerburg is.
Damn, you're a shrewd one. Shrewd.
Veronica. Finally. Got a paper of Kurt Kelly's. I need you to forge a hot and horny but realistically low-key note in Kurt's handwriting and we'll slip it into Martha Dumptruck's lunch tray.
I was talking with someone!
Pretend you're a missionary saving a colony of cootie victims.
Just imagine somebody like your quasi-fat, goody-good friend Betty Finn doing a Crest commercial. No one would buy Crest.
That episode with the note back there was for all of us to enjoy, but you're determined to ruin my day.
Crap. So who's this Brad guy I've been set up with? Witty and urbane pre-lawyer or albino accountant?
You stupid cunt!
Ku-urt, let's pa-arty.
I think you can. In Catcher in the Rye Holden says his ideal job'd be making sure some kids don't fall off a cliff. He doesn't realize if you pay too much attention to the kids, you'll back off the cliff yourself.
Yeah, she really wants to talk to you.
What. A. Martyr. Understand; Martha couldn't take the heat so she got out of the kitchen. Just think what a better place the world would be if every nimrod followed her cue.
Veronica! Color me stoked, girl. I've gotten <u>everyone</u> to sign this petition even the one who think BigFun are tuneless Eurofags. People love me!  My God, you haven't signed!
You're giving your life away to become a goddamn statistic in U.S. Fucking A Today. That's got to be the least private thing I can think of.
It's not perfect. I don't really like my friends.
That was my first game of Strip Croquet, you know. I thank you.
Now blah-blah-blah is all I do. I use my grand I.Q. to figure out what gloss to wear and how to hit three keggers before curfew. Some genius.
O-kay. We'll cook up some soup and put it in a Coke. Sick, eh? Now should it be Chicken-Noodle or Bean-with-Bacon?
What are you <u>doing</u>? You just can't go.....Besides, she'd never drink anything that looks like that.
Milk and orange juice. Hmmmm. Maybe we could cough a phlegm globber in it or something.
And your worst enemy.
What are we going to tell the cops? "Fuck it if she can't take a joke, Sarge."
Jason, why don't you ask your little friend to stay for dinner.
What is this shit?
So what? Don't smile like that, Jesus!
Kurt doesn't look too good.
You can be so immature!
It's over, J.D.  Over!
You're still not listening! I'm not..
Okay, okay. I knew that. I knew that. Put your hands on your head.
You know what I want, babe?
You really fucked me up, Veronica.
We on tonight man?
That pudwapper just stepped on my foot.
Hey kid, isn't the prom coming up?
You two....
Everybody cares for youth but nobody cares about Joey Blow. When that news reporter gets home he'll scream at his son for not mowing the lawn in the right pattern.
Veronica! J.D. told me you committed suicide last night!
I adore anything to do with the arts.
I've never cottoned on to Plasticine like you girls, but I enjoy making things out of wood.
This story of yours-maybe the school newspaper will print it when it's finished.
I'd better be getting back. Bye, love.
Bye.
wanders out. HONORA turns to Pauline and Juliet.
Got an A, Mum!
You've got to eat, Yvonne. You hardly touched our dinner. I'm not having you falling ill.
whirls around and slaps Pauline on the cheek.
My name is Gina!
Who cares!
You're rude . . . rude and insolent! I don't see why I should keep a horrid child like you at school a minute longer.
The Hulmes will look after me. They want me to live with them!
And so, in a blazing fury, Charles runs Lancelot Trelawney through with his sword . . . leaving Deborah free to accept Charles's proposal of marriage!
I wouldn't want my private business being discussed with a complete stranger!
I'm saving them for a rainy day.
looks startled at the outburst.
We don't want to tire you out, dear.
Oh-what a nice outfit!
is bending down, pulling a tray of sausage rolls into the oven. Both girls look at HONORA silently.
0h, God . . . I'm so sorry!
But, we're all going to Heaven!
How do you know? Did he tell you?
This lot's got to be worth 50 quid!
Pitbull attacks.
Lucky for us these chairs happened to be here.
Sure plenty of times.
I understand... I won't-
GWEN?
So you're just packing it up just like that?
Why don't you relax for the next couple of hours? Barring any relapses you should be able to go home after that.
Last time anybody saw this woman she was alive. You seem to certain she's dead.
As in one minus one equals zero yes. Where are you going with this?
Come on speak up, Gooding, I'm trying to run a business here. I can't have people flipping out in the break room when they should be slaving away at their desks.
Our little toy. You usually have it up and running by now.
You win! Okay pull over.
Oh my God. It's coming out.
OH MY GOD TREVOR! It hurts!!  oh my God, Oh my God. Trevor, It's coming out.
Sorry I'm in your seat aren't I?
You and your wife were playing a game shortly before you got into that car accident weren't you?
Sorry to take up your time like that Trevor. Don't work too hard. Oh, before I forget. I talked your neighbor out of pressing charges.
The whackjob in the black lipstick who lives down the hall? She wanted you arrested for harassment. I told her to chill out and smoke a joint. I'd look the other way as long as she did you know?
What happens if I'm convicted of Kirsty's murder?
How is our little student doing? Has he learned his lesson yet?
But I saw these women. I saw their mutilated bodies. I saw their ghosts. I just know it happened I can feel it...
But that's what I need. To be sure... to be absolutely sure...
Wait... what the hell is this...
... knock on my door, I'm a total insomniac.
You okay?
Tawny I think I'm going to be sick.
Whoa, I have serious space issues, dude. What do you want?
Hey you're the guy from down the hall.
Looks like you live in here, for Chrissake!
You should give it to someone with only one leg.
Hey, Bubber, c'mere!  I gotta talk to you, buddy.
I just wanna talk with you for a minute.  Then you can jump.  You can jump twice for all I care.
You should go in.  You're risking your life again...
There was this kid there saying, "Go in there and save my father, mister." And I'm thinking about my boy Joey and this goddamn fireman my wife's seeing. It was like I was supposed to save myself.
A son, yeah.  What about him?  Joey.
She don't like me to see him. Says I'm a bad influence.
I seen on the TV where that do-gooder asshole's gonna go visit sick kids at three-thirty.  Children's Hospital, on the double.
Hey!  Do I have a record?  Have I ever done time?  I mean I been arrested a few times, who hasn't? Parking tickets for Chrissake! Suspicion of stuff!  Have I ever been convicted of anything?
You in business with those guys or what?  I wouldn't want a problem for the establishment, Bern.
Hey, I don't blame you for bein' sore.  I know I screwed up gettin' busted in here.  You got a right to throw me out.
I mean, if I said it, wouldja believe me?  Ya wouldn't, would ya?
The thing is, Chick.  I'm goin' down.
Bill, listen...
Three weeks, Ev.  I didn't tell him I killed anybody...
I was giving him some advice is all. Preparing him for life.  You don't want him to grow up soft, Ev	, it's tough out there, it's a goddamn jungle.
Turn that thing off.
How do ya think I got it, for Chrissake?  Hey, put that thing down.  This is my goddamn apartment, you can't just...
I could deny I had those credit cards on the plane with me, LaPlante...
Was it you?  In the plane?  Who saved my life?
This guy, this "friend" your mother's seeing, he's a fireman, huh?  He ever... spend the night, whatsisname?
Here we are.  Yeah, that's a possibility.  A movie.  Now you gwan in, tell your mother I got you back on time.  Point that out to her. She was always on my case for stuff like that.  She's still like that, right?
You remember where I said how I was gonna explain about life, buddy?  Well, the thing about life is...  it gets weird.  See people are always gonna be talking to you about "truth." Everybody always knows what the truth is, like it was toilet paper or something and they got a supply in the closet. But what you learn as you get older is, there ain't no truth. All there is is bullshit .  Layers of it. One layer of bullshit on top of another.  So what you do in life, like when you get older, is you pick the layer of bullshit you prefer and that's <u>your</u> bullshit, so to speak.  You got that?
You're doing fine.  You didn't actually lift me though.  It was more like you supported me.
Hey, listen, great that you're a career-fiend, I got a wife and family, I...
What's the matter?
This guy LaPlante won an award?
It would make me feel like a human being instead of a cynical, hardbitten newswoman.  Besides it wouldn't be a bad story, would it, "Newswoman Saves Suicide?"
She broke up with her boyfriend.  Listen, babe, we needja back. You gotta follow up on the jumper, find the human interest in the grim, unending tale of woe that pours from the wounded heart of the heartless metropolis.
We're piecing together different accounts and...
Not bad.  But if you gotta wear a cast, you oughtta feature it more it's parta the story.  Network's taking everything we give 'em.  They wanta feed off our six o'clock whether we find the mystery guy or not.  We're very big nationally.
Does this mean I can stop worrying? Where'd we put him?
Upset!  What's he upset about?
It's not unthinkable.
Shouldn't we have buzzed him to let him know --
There's no face really, nothing to work with.  Big dots, that's all you'll get.
You didn't... get it on with him?
Reporters don't have hormones?
Excuse me, Ms. Gayley.  That guy Inspector Dayton... he's recovered a bunch of your credit cards and he wants...
They're great with kids.  They love 'em.  They eat 'em up.  I'm kidding.
Hey, c'mon.
So where are all your toys?
Wife, girlfriend or mother?
And what about work?  Have you had any more thoughts about what you'd like to be doing now?
I'm happy that you're working again.  As long as it comes naturally, that's terrific. You've always liked working with your hands, haven't you?
Right.  So, you have a new place, you've started working a bit -- I'm sure you'll be meeting some new people.
Yeah, maybe you're right. Everything else is just an excuse. I'm treating the situation with kid gloves because I'm afraid of losing her.
Oh, great.
So, you're just kind of a roving --
You must value your independence.
It's nice that you can make that choice.
I was thinking about our conversation the other day -- what you said about choices.
About what?
'"... or I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down!" And inside their new house, the three little pigs just laughed -- '
"Hi. I'm Mr. Edgar!"  Look, Mommy, it doesn't even hurt him.
So you don't have anything concrete?
Rita, he's only twelve years old,
Honey --
I know it's at the high end of our range --
But it's what we want.
What if someone else buys it in the meantime?
<u>Now</u>, Neil.  Stop teasing your sister.
Did you hear that?
Did you hear what he said?
How long does it have to be a new house?
Neil's still having a bad time at school.  I feel terrible seeing him so upset all the time.
I mean, he's a smart kid, he'll get by -- he takes after me. You're too sensitive.
I <u>remember</u> what day you wore that jacket.  It was <u>Monday</u>.  The day you were all day in <u>meetings</u> again?  And had to send out for <u>sandwiches</u>?
I don't know -- put 'em in the drawer with all the Chinese take- away menus.
Honey -- I can't find those large- size Hefty trash bags!
Oh God.
This is a terrific entrance hall, What a welcoming feeling.
You'll see that there's really much more space than the average three bedroom.
What did the thermometer say?
A <u>man</u> started the fire.
I thought I was supposed to stay in my room.
That's right -- you got the bill this morning.  I put it on your desk.
Really?
Lieutenant Bedsoe?
You didn't see this.  Understand?
Tough.
Anything from the bank?
What?
I know that weapon.  It belonged to Juan Romeriz.  He's dead?
We too are brothers, Macleod.  In fact, you have more family than you think.
Can't you enjoy it quietly?
For being a friend when I needed one. I hope our paths cross again.
That is a thought that doesn't please me.
That was two hundred and fifty years ago -- and the pain still scars your heart.  Would you live that pain again?
I'll go first.
I stood up first.
This cannot be.
Agreed.
Aye?
Do you love me, Conner?
I was wondering if I could talk to you?
Yes.  How did you know?
You're hurt.
What's going on?  Why did he call you Macleod?
Then who's Russell Nash?
Why do you stare at me like that?
No.
You have an interesting accent. Where are you from?
You're not an easy person to get to know.
Have you told Lieutenant Bedsoe your theory?
That would mean they'd been trapped in there--
On the back it has--
Where will you go now?
They've had a little car trouble. I'm afraid they won't be here until after dark.
I am stronger than you, Highlander.
It was not by choice.  A small matter of a mountain falling down on us.  We were trapped inside.  When the time of the Gathering came the urge to go was so strong we tried to claw through rock with our bare hands.  What you thought was the end -- was not.  This is the end.  We are the last of our kind, Macleod.
Would you care for some water, Conner?
I don't know.  He is the stronger one.  He has a power--
Did they?  You are only a man, different than most -- but still a man.  You feel the same -- want the same.  You want to live.
Dear, sweet, Rachel.  Men's lifes are measured by the good they do.
Good afternoon, Mr. Parker.
Mike!  Mike, can you hear me?
Talley.
The house is in flames, Benza's accountant is with the cops, and they're stacking the bodies like cordwood.
And by doing so, he would've known we have spies in his organization.
I hate that Mickey Mouse bastard.  I hated his father, and I hate Sonny, too. Always with the tan.
Sonny's a fuckup.  If he pulls this off, fine--life goes on.  But if the cops end up with those disks, we cut our losses.
I want a message sent:  No fuckups allowed.
Put our people on the scene.  Smith might talk just to cut a break for his kids.
Maybe we're getting too dramatic.  It's three kids.  They'll give up, the cops will arrest them, and that's that.  Why would they search the house?
I guess not.
What, he's cute?  That's his idea of humor?
Mars, watch the cops!  Kevin!  Watch the back of the house!
Not if they don't catch us, Kevin.
Jesus.  What is this?
Yeah.  I'm Rooney.
We're cool.
I'll give you these people.
You're a funny guy, Talley.
All you're doing is watching yourself on TV.  <u>Look</u> at him.
What about my father?
It's a safety room.  If anyone breaks into your house, you can hide.
That's right.  That's a good idea, Mars.
Cops want to be rich like everyone else. All we have to do is share.  And if he wants someone to swing for the Chinaman, we'll give'm Mars.
You got something to say?
He has a wife and kid.  That's how we'll get to him.
What if it goes south?
I heard he's fucked up.  They're taking him to the hospital.
How did you get this number?
Fuck the mall.  You know that motel on the road west of town?
You get the other one when I have my girls.  Not <u>talk</u> to them; <u>have</u> them.
I should've called.  This thing broke right after we spoke, then everything happened so fast --
Why don't you guys grab some dinner at the Thai place?  I'll meet you there as soon as I can.
You leave that gun alone!
Want one?
What do you want?
You gotta pee?
I can't go without Thomas.
That's enough.
Is something wrong with Jane?
He says that his father's hurt.
It's right in front of us.
In a few minutes the white phone is going to ring.  So let's get our shit straight before that happens.
Those kids are in there with a fucking psychopath!  He <u>kills</u> people!
Slow down, Thomas.  Take it easy and talk to me.  Was your father shot?
If I get Rooney into the back of the house, can you find the disks without being caught?
Can you open them?
I don't see any people names.  It's all businesses.
Did you find the disks?
My people are good to go.  You know who I mean?
What happened?
Paul, we would like to speak to you in your office.
Paul...  ...I have to talk to you.
Who are you?
Captain, I must take my family. It is not safe here.
Here, here, a thousand US dollars - fifty thousand francs for my family. To let us drive off to the Mille Collines.
Ten.
Have you requested re-enforcements?
Anything. Strong.
Paul, this scotch is exceptional.
The United Nations are still here.
Satellites.
Please, General, I will give you money, whiskey.
General, sir. I am glad to find you. I have found you some supplies.
The finest, and cognac, champagne. Come and I will get them for you.
We must go to the Diplomat.
You know what the Scottish call it?
Wonderful country, wonderful golf. I wonder - will I ever go back? What do you think?
The Americans, and the UN they have you as a war criminal. You are on a list.
You lie.
I led no massacres.
I will try my best George but these days I have no time for rallies or politics.
Time is money, George. We need extra beer today.
Very good.
Everything is double the price now, you do understand that?
What do you mean George?
For fuck's sake, Gloria There's a big news story out there! We need to get out and cover it.
You fucking see that!
Lets go, Jock.
Very soon.
Mr. Manager.
Are you sure this is the river road?
Give her what she wants, room, food, anything. Charge it all. Don't you put her out, Paul.
You have our cards.
How much?
No, it is impossible. That side of town has been destroyed in the fighting. The children are dead.
I will need a suite.
I'm afraid you will have to move room.
Do something.
They do not have your connections.
Send them home. We are not the police. What do we have to protect them?
This is not bad news, Tatsi. Perhaps they fled or could not make it home. There is hope.
They are being evacuated.
Your card says Hutu. Take our children, go and get the twins, pay money at the roadblocks. Get them out. Please.
To Rutagunda's place. It is close by.
A little longer, Paul?
I love you. Keep the children safe.
The Diplomat! Tatiana wakens, startled.
Can I have your name again?
Rutaganda's place?
Beg your pardon sir, you are Hutu. You are safe there.
Twelve are dead.
Where's housekeeping? They won't pick up.
Where has all our beer gone?
I saw Gregoire make a call, sir?
Moses, Moses Seradungu.
Easy. You've got to keep still for a bit, the last thing we need is a coronary.
-- or might turn out to be -- very big surprise -- that Jenzen girl. The little bitch has the right stuff. She nearly put a bullet in Price right after your "demise."
How much more do they need than your death at his hands?
And how the hell are we going to do that?
Jesus H. Christ!
Looks like we're it.
Oh, for chrissake --
What are you playing here, Price?
Just for the record: what are the rest of your names?
I'm sorry --
Upstairs, too. Come with me, I'll show you another body, a friend of mine named Schecter --
Put it this way: if it's your face on that tape, Mr. Moses, we're one gunshot away from solving all our problems --
-- I did: down here.
You said that was an accident.
So you're saying as long as that door stays locked, we're okay?
New wrinkle on an old theory for treating schizophrenia. 19th Century, I think: what would drive a sane man mad should make a madman sane. The Vannacutt version was: bombard the patient with aural and visual stimuli far more frightening than any hallucination they could ever produce, it'd traumatize 'em back to "normalcy."
Shit, Pritchett!!!
Oh. Jesus.
Pritchett, is that you?
Evelyn, could you just zip it for a moment? It looks like we're stuck here 'til morning -- let's make the best of it.
-- no. The basement -- the room with all the controls to this thing: big long iron levers just lying there --
I was upstairs with Eddie --
I think we should have taken a right back there.
It's okay, everything's okay now.
What --
Better put it on hold 'til we find Pritchett.
What?
...birds. Just seagulls or something walking on the glass, goddammit.
So, what? The thing with the glass? Price did that?
Don't touch me!
I'm not laughing, Steven.
What are you talking about? You think I invited them?
Jesus!
Steven --
I was in the middle of --
Your roller coaster that is, quote: "unlike any that has ever come before it."
Ever seen one that starts at the top? 20 stories worth of top?
She's been marked for it. The House does that. Happened to Pritchett's father. Likely happen to you all. Isn't that what you told me, Mr. Pritchett?
Yeah. Why's there five checks? There's only four of us.
This is all maybe getting a little too strange --
Sorry.
I...don't think...anybody should be touching the body.
I was upstairs!
If you've got a gun on you, Price, I'd hand it over now.
Then tell me, please -- help me...!
Houston, I think we may have a problem.
Rewind that.
Then who did??
Don't know that it does.
Pritchett, this "lockdown" thing -- it's gotta have like a master control -- you know machinery, gears, whatever -- somewhere in this place?
There is something very not normal going on here!
Price!
-- Eddie!!
I feel something.  It's faint, but...it's there...
It doesn't say.  But that's not what interests me.  There's no death certificate for the daughter.  Anywhere.
So many unanswered questions.  Why was she buried there.  And who killed her?
They don't build them like this anymore.
By freeing them.
Mommy, the leprechauns drank the milk last night.
Can I do it again tonight?
She's down...
Aubrey, come on down and have some dinner!
H-how long will it take?
Your father doesn't love us anymore!
Oh my God, what happened to you? My baby -
Can I have this room daddy?
Look daddy!  It's empty!
Mommy please help me!
What's the matter?
Not really.  She was just one of those names you hear growing up. You know, so-and-so who lives in Ireland.  I really don't think anyone knew about this place.
Well, I try to keep an open mind, but...
There's got to be an explanation. It could be a magnetic flux or something, maybe the power lines are giving off something.  Who knows?  I don't know, I think it's kind of interesting.
Just because I have an open mind doesn't mean I'm going to pay some snake oil peddler to come in and shake a voodoo stick around the house.
It just disappeared.  Literally.
Whoa there...
We'll destroy you...destroy all of you!
We don't know.
Is white meat all right for you, Mr. Shea?
Well it's nice that you were there for her.
My name is Father Seamus.  I'm from Holy Rood church.
I hope everything works out for you, and you find happiness in your new home.
Well there's no time like the present.  Good night.
I said nothing before, for fear you wouldn't believe me.  I've been here before to cast evil from this house.  The amulet is a guard against evil, blessed in countless rituals.   It is an ancient ceremony of the early Catholic church, a ceremony whose secrets are all but lost.
Well, you know where to reach me. The church is a stone's throw away if you want to come to mass.
Well it all depends on how much money you want to spend.  A standard visit would run you about fifty pounds.  That would include myself and an assistant.
Do you have any other physical evidence, that we can look at?
Where did you find this?
Better hurry, Doc.  A real story.  With a real reporter.
Hello?
The cusp of my life.  What I was, what I am, what I will be ... past, present, future, all bound here at this timeless moment of decision.  I was an explorer of forbidden vices and pleasures. Opening the Box was my final act of exploration, of discovery.
Something bad.
I like you, Joey.  You ask all the right questions.  There is something we can do but it will require great courage.
Joey, you walked through your window from one reality to another.  You're stronger than you think.
Wha .... ?
Hold on.  Hold on, please.  I need talk to you.
Why are you so interested?
Great.  Thanks.  You gonna have one?
But I don't know anything!  Really.  I just came out of the club and the kid was already in the street.  He ...
The thing!  He was lying there in the street, moaning.  But he pointed at it ... 22
How have you ... ?
Jesus.  Are you sure this is the street?
For somebody else, alright?  Not for me. I don't do that shit anymore.
No.  Sorry.  Not interested.  Not for my customers.  Have you tried ...
Never mind.  I'm glad it's gone.  Made the store feel strange.  Who'd make such a thing?
You gonna buy?
You shit.  Who do you think you are?
Don't flee from yourself.  If you have a quality, let it define you.  Cultivate it.  It is you.  By helping me, you will help yourse...
Joey?
Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well ... I'm fine. Things are great here.  Joey's going to get me a job at the TV station.  I'm meeting lotsa new people.  It's really great.
I miss you too.
Yeah right.  Look ...
That was beautiful.
Three minutes, 51 seconds.
Those dago-guinea-I can say this shit I'm Italian-wop motherfu--
They record everything their video surveillance takes in...
You got about five minutes and change.
"He can't write his name or read a book.  To fool people is his only thought."
The song's over!  Come on! "You could be swinging on a star."
Okay, you got me, Mr. PBS.
No sweat, Alex, you only made the biggest mistake of <u>my</u> life.  What was your per-diem?
Now that's a lock.
My life is not some deal.  I...
Welcome back to Vinci.
Lucky for us, the Da Vinci is located in a wing of the Kremlin that they used to throw the Miss Ukraine pageant and stuff.  It'll have the least number of guards....
What the hell....
Did he mention the Mayflowers?
Attempt, you mean.  The vanity of this man, Hudson Hawk.  The Vatican has foiled the advances of Pirates and Terrorists.  We will not lie down for some schmuck from New Jersey.  Must you flirt with him so realistically?
Let me be the one to quote Scripture.  ....As an agent of our organization, you are put in awkward situations.  Just remember, Hudson Hawk is an evil, evil man.
Hit me with your best shot.
You got it.  Operation Deflower Mayflower is a bad joke and I'm the punchline.  I thought we were using the CIA to help us to get Mayflower, but really the CIA was using me to keep us away from Mayflower.
No, I meant you didn't have to tackle me and rip my dress.  A polite push, perhaps?  A clear shout of "watch out, Anna" would have done nicely...
Whoa, part 2.  Does it go to Times Square?
You're not an unmysterious thang yourself.
It's not what you think.  Okay, maybe it is....
Hudson, don't you understand...
Where did you get this?
Selfish attitude?  I'm just some guy who wants a little nap and a cappuccino for when he wakes up, not too much foam...
Hey, don't take your disguise so seriously.
I hope you know what....
Da Vinci made the real directions in a secret script that I decoded. The way the machine is running now, the gold will produce too quickly, clog, and the machine will shut itself down.  Isn't it wonderful?
Have I ever told you the world is beautiful...  I'd really like to play Nintendo with you, or something...
It's the site of their new museum and we're taking it over.  Operation Deflower Mayflower is going full speed ahead.
How many times do I have to say it?  I didn't put the hit on Little Eddie... Never had anything against that kooky chimp.  I actually found him, "endearing."
Haven't you ever seen, like David Niven?  You know tiptoe in, tiptoe out.
Why do you show your parole officer such disrespect? Especially after I got you such a nice job.
The auction house, asshole.  One night's work and you're free like no ex-con's ever been.  No checking in with a shrink, no community service teaching retards how to play air hockey. It's a great deal, I can't lie.
Get away from there, convict!
If you pull this off, I can't promise I won't kill you.  I mean, who we trying to kid?  But I will spare the Flying Nun here....
Damnit, I hate this!  I'm a cat burglar!  Nobody said anything about this fight-to-the-death shit.
Hawk, Hawk, Hawk.  Enjoying Italy?  I always had a soft spot for Rome.  Did my first barehanded strangulation here.  Communist politician.
If you do anything to my friend...
The Hoop-dee-doo!
I had twenty thousand shares! I'd be a millionaire now!
That smart?!
Why on earth would they want a nitwit to be president?
...Hello?
Ol' satchel-butt...
-- and she's dynamite!
Yeah, and I'll bet his initials are Sidney J. Mussburger!
Cigarette?
Oh, of all the foolish... Listen, do you take shorthand? Are you familiar with the mimeograph machine?
Smitty.
...The people look like ants.
Yeah, I think I've heard of that. What goes around comes around.
Your i --
...I've been watching you, Norville Barnes, even though you've been trying to avoid me --
Shutup! -- and don't think I haven't noticed how you've changed. I used to think you were a swell guy -- well, to be honest I thought you were an imbecile --
Shutup! -- after all! You haven't talked to me for a week and now I'm going to say my piece. I've got a prediction for you, Norville Barnes: I predict that since you've decided to dedicate yourself to greed and sloth and everything bad, you're going to lose all the good things that your good ideas brought you. You're going to throw them all away chasing after money and ease and the respect of a Board that wouldn't give you the time of day if you... if you...
...You son of a --
I got big ideas, though!
...What's your pleasure, buddy?
Forty-four, the top brass floor say, buddy! What takes fifty years to get up to the top floor and thirty seconds to get down?
Say, buddy! Who's the most liquid businessman on the street?
Oh, uh... Buzz... Is it important?
Wuddya mean, buddy?
Awwww, buddy --
I understand if ya don't like the Buzz-Sucker! Just lemme keep my job, I'm prayin' to ya!
I'm sorry, buddy... I'm sorry...
-- Uh... Buzz, I'm sorry, I -- Buzz, you gotta forgive me! I shouldn't a fired you, I didn't know what I was doing! I was a little funny in the head, I --
Sir?
But look, I'm president of the company now and I --
...education, were you?
At the Muncie College of Business Administration.
You're fired.
But --
My God! The Bumstead contracts!!
Finally.
No kiddin', Bennie. I got gas.
...and awduhs a light lunch.
...He's not noticing, Benny.
...adenoids.
She isn't!
What's this?
Believe me, Mrs. Rand, he doesn't do this often. This is the first time I've seen him --
Thank you, Mrs. Rand.  I think you're every bit as nice as Wes says you are.
I'd love to.
I've no influence with Mr. Holland.
Haven't I?  I suppose I take it for granted. It's just part of everyday life here.
A missionary's widow?  It isn't very likely, is it?
Mrs. Rand.
But how did you get here? What are you doing here?
The West Indies?
But it's so far away...
It seems we are having dinner by ourselves, Miss Connell.  But I may as well introduce everyone to you, anyway.  There -- in the master's chair, sits the master -- my half-brother Paul Holland.  But you've already met him.
-- But, you're an American?
Yes, the redoubtable Paul.  He has the plantation, and I, as you must have noticed, have all the charm.
Perhaps you ought to get on to the mill.
Where do you think you're going?
How do you know there's two ounces in a drink?
Don't let it bother you so, Wes.
I'd like to go now, Rand.  Would you mind taking me home?
Betsy, can I talk to you a minute?
She hated sleep.  She used to say it was a thief -- stealing away her life, an hour at a time...
I heard someone crying -- a woman --
That's hard to believe, after what happened last night.
I suppose so.  Yes.
Wesley can be very entertaining.
I know what you went through tonight.  I kept thinking of what you said: that all good things died here, violently.
You have helped me.  I want you to know I'm sorry I brought you here. When I thought of a nurse, I thought of someone hard and impersonal.
I told you.
You know why.  You saw it the other night at the piano.  You turned away from me.
I can understand that.  Everyone feels that way about someone.
That's past -- that's over and done with...
I wouldn't worry too much, Commissioner.  It'll pass.  We've had this sort of thing before.
I think I do.  I've often talked a little voodoo to get medicine down a patient's throat.
I don't know -- I don't know--
But I assure you, Father Walters, Miss Connell had no idea of the consequences when she went there.
An accident at the mill?
What about her?
If I were as sure as you, Mrs. Rand, we wouldn't be here.  I'll tell you quite bluntly: for the peace of the island and possibly for her own safety, we've come to ask you to send Mrs. Holland away to St. Thomas.
I believe there's a kinder name for it, Wesley. At St. Thomas, it's called the Institute for Mental Therapy.
That could be a serious accusation, Rand, if it weren't a foolish one.
Well, gonna make a break for the hors d'oeuvres guy.
Don't be so modest, Ben. It's a job that requires a certain prescience with regards to entertainment trends. You were the first to predict that Billy Jack would be a hit --
Oh not again Elena! If we've got problems, why can't you just come out and talk about them.
The Halfords have invited us again this year.
What do you think?
You all right there?
I... I think I am...
Yikes -- I was hoping to wear this thing to the Halford's Friday.
Dinner in ten minutes.
I get you loud and clear... hey, you look nice.
What's for dessert?
It wouldn't make a pleasant evening, if that's what you're after. I don't want to talk about it. Stupid mustache cup.
This just isn't the best moment for this.
Elena, it's not what you think. It's not a big plot. Honestly. Honestly. I don't know if you want to go over this now, but it's just something that comes over me. I don't feel good about it. I know I've done what I didn't want to do. I don't know --
Elena, you're just getting wound up to get wound up.
Do you think? Maybe we should call someone --
I'm fine dad.
So how's school treating you?
Well it's good to see you -- we miss you around the house and all, but this St. Peter's, it's top of the line, eh?
Holy! Well. If you're worried about anything, just feel free to ask, and, uh, we can look it up.
Um, Paul. On second thought, can you do me a favor and pretend I never said any of that.
What are you talking about?
A prior engagement overcame me.
How you take it isn't all that interesting to me, Benjamin. I'm sorry --
What the hell are you kids doing down here?
Talking to me, dad?
Your toes cold?
Actually it's not about work, it's advice about --
-- 73
Thank you Janey.
Look, Elena, the fact that we're neighbors... you know, close friends, well it sort of makes this a little strange, don't you think?
Now don't make me feel as if I'm being too forward, OK? If you don't --
Jesus, let me make it up to you -- I can do better than that, honestly --
Hi mom.
I saw you on your bike today.
We're going to the Halford's. The number's on the calendar in the kitchen. We should be home around 11.
Thanks again. For the dinner.
I used to know how to cook.
You weren't. You actually, for some reason, you have the effect on me of making me feel just a tiny bit ashamed of myself.
You're here... I'm a bit surprised.
Arise and shine, young Hood.
Paul, cancel your mental appointments, baby. What are you, like still stoned from last night?
No more man. I'm about to drop as it is.
Sleep all day. I mean, look, it's already getting dark outside, and you're just getting up.
Huh?
And whence has yon virginal maiden absconded?
Check it out. Not for the faint of heart.
Awesome sleet and rain.
Everything's gonna freeze, the big freeze.
Hey.  I'll take this stuff.
I'm in love with Libbets Casey.
Truly? Do speak.
Stupid!  Is Wendy Hood your girlfriend?
Mikey?
It's freezing.
I don't ever want to see you.
You have to follow me?
When worlds collide.
You're parents at that party?
Charles.
How are the parental units functioning these days?
Is this Charles?
Right.
They were old. And they couldn't fly anyhow. I'm going to get a radio-controlled airplane at Christmas, and then I'll stuff it full of m-80s and then fly it into Mrs. Burgess's English class and blow it up.
We -- we have to go to the guest room. We can't stay in here. What if Mikey? My parents?
Yes, sir.
But here's the thing.  I retraced your exact steps according to your statement. You couldn't have seen Detective Eckhart from there.  I mean, not in that fog.
Duggar called him?
It's legitimate.
Sorry about...
He would have liked that.
No.
We're sure it's hers?
I'll stick it in the evidence locker...
What are you doing here?
That's right.
Did she?
What do you want to talk about?
You know my plan of action.
He's asking everybody questions.
No way.
Fred Duggar?
I'm not expecting anyone.
Stuff.
Just stuff.  I don't fucking remember.
I was her best friend.
It was like some big fucking secret!
She used some stupid code name.
No game.
I'm sorry?
Couldn't get it up, Walter?
Yes.  Like that.
You're not following procedure.
I understand. I saw you in the theatre, your suffering, your sympathy for that girl. I saw you with the boy. You die when you kill, you feel you deserve to die and you stint on nothing. But does that make you evil? Or, since you comprehend what you call goodness, does it not make you good?
And perhaps this is the only real evil left...
I was waiting for you...
I'm not innocent. But I'm afraid. She feels she's in danger from the others.
We want no quarrel with him.
So soon? Without any of those answers you so longed for?
And the vampires of the Theatre?
And yet you knew what I would o.
Your melancholy eyes...
What is it now? You irritate me! Your very presence irritates me!
Laudanum!
Don't Louis --
How did you learn to write, Claudia?
Why does he call you that?
Claudia! You did that?
You... fed on me?
In Europe, Louis. We shall meet our own kind. Find the one who made him. Learn what it means.
Louis, look at me.
You never talked to me like that - in all these years.
What was that?
How do I look?
You don't remember? Or you never knew.
But this can't be real. This is nonsense.
You would leave me for Armand if he beckoned you.
Oh God! I love you still, that's the torment of it. But you know I must leave you Louis...
They would have killed you -
Who the hell are you? What are you doing in my house?
Vampires. We thrive on blood.
You let your overseer run riot, work your slaves to the bone. We'll start with him.
You've just done it -
Yes, that's you, my handsome friend. And you'll look that way till the stars fall from heaven.
You must get into it. It's the only safe place for you when the light comes.
But we can live without taking human life. It's possible.
They know about us. They see us dine on empty plates and drink from empty glasses.
I respect life, don't you see? For each and every human life I have respect.
What do you imagine you are Louis?
The girl, Lestat -
My God... to think you... are all I have to learn from...
Do what it is in your nature to do. And you will feel as you felt with that child in your arms.
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
I'm so glad you're here Louis... I've dreamed of your coming...
And they frighten you?
You believe this, don't you? That you're a vampire? You really think...
What can I do to put you at ease? Shall we begin like David Copperfield? I am born, I grow up. Or shall we begin when I was born to darkness, as I call it. That's really where we should start, don't you think?
The story about stakes through the heart?
No... it can't end like that...
But you talk about passion, about longing, about things I'll never know in my life! It's still inside you, in every syllable you speak! And then you tell me it ends like that? Just empty?
You promise to care for her then?
Stupid. Stupid.
Get lost, you scared me.
Titus, you're so stoned, you'd end up in Spain.
I thought you were out of town!
The number's unlisted...
You gotta sell his butt on the Bahamas?
I'm the King of the World.
Nice move.
Karla!
Oh, stop it! He's dead. You killed him. Now, get over it. We gotta think here.
Julie...
What do you mean?
There's no way to lock it.
Oh, god, it's you --
Every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good-friend thing first.
Ray, I can't...
Ray...what are you doing?
Never do that again.
You're the most beautiful woman in the bar tonight, Jules.
Voodoo.
The shower again?
I'm sorry.
You've got a better chance of getting hit by lightning.
No, no, no. This was really sweet...
Guess the capital of Brazil --
I used to be a lifeguard...I'd hate to have to blow my whistle.
Somebody...is a sick, fingerpainting psycho.
I'll come with you.
Julie, is everything cool? Karla said...
To a great weekend --
Waaaaahhhhhhhhhh!
Well, there's some flaws in her...
Hell, that's worth three, easy. And you got your waiting period.
Can't talk right now.
The last day of the season. Yeah, we heard.
We'll only be a second, okay?
Where'd Estes go?
But the gods played a little trick on me. I was born in Switzerland.
He complained of not feeling well. I thought he was drunk 	he staggered.
There was some trouble here the villagers on the mainland -this island was the focal point of their anger. They came here broke open the tombs and despoiled the graves.
You were singing, weren't you? A beautiful voice, Miss St. Aubyn.
I hope Mr. Jacks gets to bed in one piece.
I'm glad you and the General didn't have to leave us. We would feel quite deserted..
You're not leaving tomorrow..?
I know it must be hard. But you have relatives in London --you've got a whole world of living, ahead of you --
Oh, no - it's too delicious! You're making it up!
My father -- I'm alone, Oliver, completely alone!
Shh it's all right - I'll be all right.
Cathy - how does it feel to have a father?
I mean, does one love a father because he is good and kind -or just because he is one's father?
I felt he did not like me.
Your father knew it too. But he was never sure how much was pretense.
I've always known what an evil mind lay behind that pretty weak face of yours  but this, Cathy -- even I would never have believed it is of you.
When I tell him that you're unfit to live a normal life with normal people - a cataleptic!
He sleeps quietly. He died with a wine glass in his hand -- he died laughing -- a brave man, Drossos, like his father before him.
That's superstition. That's something out of old tales -- about the dead who live - I'm talking of something else --cataleptic attacks -- apparent death that is not real.
Theodosia.
You know that sound, Oliver?
Well, at any rate, I would like to say goodbye to the girl.
I've seen men die drunk - and I've seen men die of the plague.
Until we know, what choice is there? We have to stay.
Why in the world can't you?
I knew that feuds still went on, but I didn't think people like you and the General would be involved.
I don't think so, Thea. He has spoken of your mother. I don't believe he knows you are his daughter.
Get that ladder up here.
All right, put up your hands. No fast moves. Come on out here, both of you.
Go through with what?
Oh, tut, tut, tut.
What did you say?
I can't fly. I haven't got any wings.
Clarence . . .
I . . .
She's . . .
If you're going to help a man, you want to know something about him, don't you?
Hey, who's that?
Did he ever marry the girl? Did he ever go exploring?
. . . two of them as they were about to crash into a transport full of soldiers.
Hi, Daddy.
There it is, good as new.
Hee-haw!
Hmmmm . . .
Hmmm . . .
Yes. Sam's crazy about Mary.
Well, how do you know? Did she discuss it with you?
Well then, how do you know?
Oh . . .
Mother, you know, I can see right through you  right back to your back collar button . . . trying to get rid of me, huh?
George! George!
You're not paid to be a canary.
Yes, sir. They have the diphtheria there, haven't they, sir?
No . . . No . . . No. . .
Mr. Gower . . . Mr. Gower . . . thanks ever so much for the bag. It's just exactly what I wanted.
Oh, it's wonderful.
Okay  all right. Double bourbon, quick, huh?
Hope you have a good trip, George. Uncle Billy and I are going to miss you.
Father, did I act like that when I graduated from high school?
Mary . . . Mary, I'm sorry. I've got to go.
Hello, George, how are you?
Two cents worth of shoelaces?
Good afternoon, Mr. Bailey.
George, can I see you for a second?
What is this, Uncle Billy? A holiday?
Why didn't you call me?
All right now, what happened? How did it start?
Pop!
Yes. Well, most people say you stole all the rest.
Oh, yes, George Bailey. Whose ship has just come in  providing he has brains enough to climb aboard.
Sure, sure, sure. You go on home and talk about it to your wife.
Yes, sir.
No, sir. No, sir. I haven't.
Do I look as funny as you do?
Too young or too old?
Okay, then, I'll throw a rock at the old Granville house.
Oh, no, George, don't. It's full of romance, that old place. I'd like to live in it.
Oh, no.
If I told you it might not come true.
They're way downtown. They'd be on my side, too.
How's that?
Where'd you get that dress?
All right, for a minute. I still can't understand it though. You know I didn't tell anybody I was coming here.
Hi.
Oh, George, George!
My hair's getting wet!
It's okay, it's okay....
Bring her to port a little.  That's it -- steady.
Don't!
Yeah, it's her job.
Putz -- that won't be for hours.
What is it?
As soon as you get us on the island, you got to call in.  My dad's the mayor....
Coming up!
Want to talk about it?
Sean!   Catch the rope!
Tina!
On your own time?
I never heard of a 908.
We got a helluva tide this month.
I know just where to go.
How long ago?
I don't know about him -- I'm going down to the dock, maybe go sailing.
You stay here a minute.
Pop....
I got something for you to do tomorrow.
Sailing?  Forget it.  You're beached. Grounded.  No more boats.
Mike?  Is that you?
Sure, sure -- Jeff Hendricks brought in this camera, see, from underwater, and I didn't know how to get it open, but my brother-in- law, in Montauk, he works at a hi- fi store, and they sell cameras, so he....
Let's see -- you got a minute?
Wait a minute....
There is nothing to discuss.
Maybe I don't make as much money as some bullshit rip-off artists around here, but I don't work the same way.
Length, 22 feet, 8 inches.
The whale's mouth?
This is a mammal, not a fish.
Probably.
Mmmm.
Eat Cheerios.
One what?  Ah-ha!
Thank you.  I'll tell him.
Found one of the missing victims from that boat deal.
In the city, it happened all the time -- some Kid o.d.'s on a rooftop, top, a drunk gets cut in pieces under the Brooklyn local, old people die alone in shitty apartments and three weeks later someone calls the cops because of the smell and the flies.  Call the cops.  What are we, immune?
What're you going to do today?
Hello, hello.  It went well, I thought.
Are you serious?
A tragedy.  But that was a boating accident; no bites, no sharks, nothing but a boating accident.
There's always deaths in these waters that never turn up.  Are they all shark victims?
Bullshit.
Chief -- the Board of Selectmen has a question only you can answer.
Martin, it could be anything.
Did he raise the Kids?
Yeah?  Then what?
Did you say Cable Junction?
Some people.
Hang on!
I want you to meet my cousin.
Mike!  Are you going out?
Did you ever see a dolphin?
Get a dance yet?
Tina Wilcox.
No class.
Anyone know what time it is?
By 7:46, when the tide turns around, we'll be twenty miles out.  More, with this wind.
Take a break for a minute, okay?
Come on back up here!
What is it?
We'll be over by the lighthouse.
It'll be fun, come on!
I don't care.
Mike and Larry are racing! Loser goes home alone!
What about me?
Not tonight.
I don't need you.  Andy's here.
Do I have to play with the little kids?
I think we got a couple of live ones.
Oh, my God....
We're ready for you.
It hasn't adjusted.
It would make a marvelous attraction;  the only Great White in captivity.
Absolutely.  Good idea.
We're going to have to cover the entire lagoon.
Look, Kathryn.  They're jealous.
Damn it.  I can't understand!  I gotta go, hon.
That macho pompous English --
They're coming with us?
Honey... you all right?
Damn it!
It's romantic down here.
Where are you going?
You would, wouldn't you?  I'd end up whale shit, you wouldn't care.
How the hell did it get in here?
Oh, yeah.  Really nice.  Who's your designer?  Sassoon Shark?
Fine piece of engineering.
Kathryn...
Change your mind?
After this has opened, when everything's settled down, you and I are going away.  Just the two of us.  No dolphins, no sharks, no whales, no penguins. Just you and me.
Recovering nicely.
It's too soon to move him.
I did.  He wants it on exhibit.
Honey, what is it?
So?
How is he?
... I have to go, honey.  Phillip and I are going down together to kill the shark.
That's right.
Michael, you don't have to go down there.
I don't know.  They're nervous and skittish right now.
Wait a minute.  These aren't kangaroos, Mr. Hutton.  They're dolphins.
I can have them walk backwards.
Unhappy combination.  Most likely one's inside the other.
That's a load of codswopple.  A Great White doesn't fear man.  It doesn't fear beast.  It's an orgy of food and blood.
A shark could have a hundred embryos in its sack.  You know how many are born?  Maybe five. They eat each other before birth! They're born killers!
Lunch for Whitey.  Something to munch on in case things get dicey.
Could be a new dance...  Walking the Shark.
'Course they're also so rich.
You gonna work at The Kingdom?
I'm a water-skier.
Well, I needed a cold shower.
Told you you'd like it.
No...  It can't be.
What're you doing later?
Back, Kelly.  Lean back!
No, South Georgia.
Polar bears.
I'll stay out of your way.  I won't interfere.
He's big, Hutton.  You never saw anything so big.  Watch yourself.
Let us know as soon as you have anything.
Hey, what's goin' on, little brother!
In a restaurant.  You sit there and they swim around you.
Mike, this is fantastic.  I mean, you're responsible for building all this.  What a job you've done! Maybe I'll quit school and come down here and work with you. Brody Brothers Construction. We've always wanted to do that together.  Boat building.
You and Kathryn gonna stay here?
She still talking to you?
Sure.
Thea....
I've always wanted to ride one of those....
It sure is good to be home....
It doesn't take much to remember what day they come....
Turn it off....
Why didn't you tell us?  Why didn't you tell us?
Henny Youngman....
All he did was kiss me....
Sweet breezes...Sweet women....
What the hell's it doing in warm water anyway...?
In a minute....
I never....
I like Grandma's cooking....
We have to dig it deep so the water will go all the way around...So we can swim to it....
No one.  Nothing.  We've got to get this finished before the tide comes in.
I almost forgot....
I'll be in to read you a story.
I want you to give up that terrible job.
Mom, you're upset.  Sit down...Please....
Oh, it looks like my uncle's.  He taught me how to sail when I was a kid....
No more sharks.  I'll stay for another week, then....
Can you just go off...?
Flies the plane....
It's just like driving a car....
You promised me a drink....
The kind with an umbrella in it....
I have two right feet.
Our little island seems to agree with you....
Because it wouldn't occur to you to know why.  Blushing suits you....
I can't....
They had them on the big one....
Want to go for a little ride?
I don't know why I fish here...Never catch anything...Must be a sign under the water...'Beware, Hoagie's here....'
Can you keep a secret?  Something no one else knows?
It was theirs anyway.  I 11 buy us all a drink....
I hope she's a good sailor....
What do you mean, it'll find her?
Jake tells me you're going to have to fly for the rest of your life to pay off what you lost at the crap table....
Yeah....
Tricky little devils, aren't they? How's the degree doing?
She has good days and bad...I don't know....
I wish there was something I could do....
I know how to tag a damn conch....
Hey!
Sharp shirt, Jake....
Money is money....
How long?
Bring her about.  We're headed in the wrong direction....
We lost it....
I'm coming...How close is it?
What about Carla's gig?
You getting a reading on them?
How come only me?
'A Moray eel....'
Stop that!
What the hell are you doing?
All the time....
Your equipment has crapped out again....
Jake.
I knew there was a reason I could afford this.  To the woman of my dreams.. Who grows more beautiful....
Woman has taste....
Did you like that, Mama?
I'm glad of it. I'd rather please you than anybody I know of. Oh, darlin', will you give me something?
You'll never guess. Shut your eyes, Mama. Shut 'em for little Jakie. Ha. I'm gonna steal something.  Ha, ha, ha, ha. I'll give it back to you some day, too, you see if I don't. Mama, darlin', if I'm a success in this show, well, we're gonna move from here. Oh yes, we're gonna move up in the Bronx. A lot of nice green grass up there and a whole lot of people you know. There's the Ginsbergs, the Guttenbergs, and the Goldbergs. Oh, a whole lotta Bergs; I don't know 'em all. And I'm gonna buy you a nice black silk dress, Mama. You see Mrs. Friedman, the butcher's wife, she'll be jealous of you.
Yes, I'm gonna ride on the Shoot-the-Chutes. An' you know in the Dark Mill? Ever been in the Dark Mill?
Be my guest. What you got?
No, Sir. I haven't started till Monday. I'm a "tourist."
What do you think?
Who is who?
Not today .. I'm on a diet to- day .. I'll take a diet soda ..
What time is it?
There's nothing in the files?
It's a technique I read about. If you smoke 60 a day, you buy three packs, throw one cigar- ette away, and smoke 59. Day 2, you throw 2 away and smoke 58 ..
Why don't you dump it? Mail it off. Give the fucking F.B.I. a present?
Where is everyone?
We're going.
I haven't got it.
Why?
What are you doing, Ross? I've had that 15 years! ..
No, I think you'll find I looked like he could have? By accident even? He's up here spraying the scenery all day.
God, it pisses me off, Ross.
Stop it.
You gotta stop calling Los Angeles .. You're dragging L.A. around with you like an addiction.  Look at the shit you're putting yourself through? For what? For <u>nothing</u>, I know it, I been there. Remember me? Up to my asshole in anger, living off the vitamins in cigarettes?  If there's a body under the snow, <u>fuck</u> <u>it</u>. Let somebody else worry about it. You gotta accept you stopped living in that world, & try and give yourself a break in this ..
Ease off, John ..
What about Citrine?
Jesus. What are you doin?
What exactly you doing, John?
Where's your watch?
Why did he ask if it was frozen?
Probably making him feel a bit antsy seein it back on the wall. He worked a lotta time on this.
Have you got a print from the hand?
Don't underestimate me .. the Mayor's pissed - but that's nothing to do with this - sit down - How many times have you been up at that institute?
I'm talking, outside the girl?
Did he get you the job?
.. feel like I'm getting close to this guy .. and all the time, feel like I'm sharpening a pencil with a broken load .. I'm sorry, King J ..
Don't you know nothing about this guy? He <u>reads</u> the newspapers. Col- lects the cuttings. When are they gonna find her? Now he's reading Helena Robertson's name, phrased like she's a fucking witness. You couldn't have done anything more stupid if you'd sat down & tried ..
Then what are you hoping I'm gon- na do? Dissuade, or persuade you?
Well, apparently, she saw Amber the weekend she left, & was briefly in the room with the guy she left with.
Is there anything else you can tell me? Anything about him or her? Doesn't matter how small?
D'you have a dog? Seeing Eye Dog?
I'm sorry. I'll get my things.
If I came to the diner with you, would you bring me back?
I'm sorry, someone slammed the door on me. I couldn't get out.
Are you wearing a uniform?
You just asked me to ask you questions.
Sorry?
I have to talk to you, Helena.
He doesn't need my help.
What are you doing, Travis?
Why?
You got a warrant for this?
Interview over, Blattis ...
No it isn't .. It's Californian ..
Such a shame .. She's a really sweet kid ..
You can drive down there, Sir ..
Damn A, it's O.K. With a bit of luck I'm goin home. What we got?
The coroner wants to know if we can release the derelict?
"Dad says we gwan sleep on it.
Good.  They're all heatseekers!  All of them, everybody. You keep one superstar and they'll all follow. There's no real loyalty, and the first person who told me that, Jerry Maguire, was you.
King of the Housecalls! Master of the Living Room!
I have to finish my job --
Tell you what -- I'd prefer loyalty..
Cush, Matt -- we have a decision to make.
Okay. San Diego just came in with a last-minute scenario.  It's big.
Reporters, Jerry.  They been callin' all night.
Airight.  Enough.  I'm pulling him out of this.  This isn't what I had in mind anyway.
No no...
Oh no.  I'm sure it would just make your day to drive us all the way to Manhattan Beach, taking that left down to little tiny Waterloo street where you have to play chicken with oncoming traffic, and your life flashes before your eyes, but -- hey, I've obviously had too much coffee and all -- here's my sister Laurel to pick us up.  Thanks, though. Bye.
So I know this is a bad time, but -- you will have a medical program, right?
And I guess we didn't talk about money.  So, I'll just dive in --
Thanks for inviting me over. Where's the little guy?
-- especially one like this.
Truth?
Dennis Wilburn called from Arizona to say he's faxing in the new Tidwell offer on Thursday morning, and you'll be happy.
I sunk most of what I had into this condo, which devalued, and --
Look, the other night, I want to apologize.
We're two people working together and we can't have an atmosphere.
It was laziness1 my whole breakup with Avery. You know that thing you say, "it's nobody's fault." It's one of the great lies, right? Someone is always to blame -- if you go for it, go for it like you do a job, work at it --
I think you should not come in, or come in depending on how you feel.
Oh God.
Another time, okay Dorothy?
I don't need you to "stick."
I don't know --
This used to be my specialty. I was good in a living room.  Send me in there, I'll do it alone. And now I just... I don't know... but on what was supposed to be the happiest night of my business life, it wasn't complete, wasn't nearly close to being in the same vicinity as complete, because I couldn't share it with you.  I couldn't hear your voice, or laugh about it with you.  I missed my wife.  We live in a cynical world, and we work in a business of tough competitors, so try not to laugh --  I love you.  You complete me.
What about medical?
You know how much those Well Child exams cost --
He just lost his best client.  He called from the plane.  I invited the guy over.
No, Roy.  I'm not gonna cry.
Oh yes.  Jerry Maguire!  My agent! This is a fierce, loving individual, I love this man, he is love, he is about love -- my ambassador of kwan.
I want him to go number one in the draft, and I want him to play.
What happened to Denver?
Alright, we're just getting started on my list of things you need to know. Take notes if you want to.
I came all the way here for that? To walk the lobby?
You love me now, don't you?
See this jacket I'm wearing?  You like it?  I don't really need it, because I'm CLOAKED IN FAILURE. I lost the number one draft pick the night before the draft. They will teach my story to other agents on "do not do this" day in agent school. Why? Let's recap. Because a hockey player's kid made me feel like a superficial jerk, I had two slices of bad pizza, went to bed, grew a conscience and wrote a 25-page Manifesto of Doom!
The least you could do is nod and act sympathetic --
--  the kwan.
"Love me love me love me... put me on t.v."  That's the iconography of rascism, man!
What's wrong.
I'm out here for you!  You don't know what it's like to be me out here for you. It is an up-at-dawn pride-swallowing seige that I will never fully tell you about! Okay?! Help me help you help me help you.
The kid is amazing.
I'm sorry I asked.
Gorgeous.
Which they do.  And we're standing there. All the football guys are in the lobby, watching, there's even an ESPN crew.  So I turn to her and sort of grandly say, "Well, this is me, Klutz, asking you, Goddess of Rock Climbing, to marry me." And I took out the ring, and I don't much like big scenes, but she said "yes" right there in the lobby and some of the toughest men in football wept like babies.  We're getting married in February.
Cronin's okay for lunch?
I'm fine.  What's up?
SMI represents all three quarterbacks on your team, where's their loyalty going to be?  You stay with me, I'd fight for YOU alone.  You'd be my only client on that team...
Hi.
And then my dad died and my mom took me to the zoo and I love the zoo. Do you hate the zoo or do you love the zoo?
Let's go right now.  Let's go to the zoo.
I won't tell.
What's going on, Jerry?
-- I give you my favorite animal in the zoo.  Are you ready for the weirdness, the strange perfection and truth of...
Now go kiss your daddy, quick.
We can't just stop looking. Eric and Dr. Grant are out there somewhere.
I don't remember
What?...WHAT!?
Eric, its okay. You'll be right behind me.
Paul! Where is he? Can you see him?
He could have died.
You had the phone the whole time?
They couldnt climb up, so they were trying to get us to come down.
How was your trip? Profitable?
You rented an automated litter box.
I CAN GET HIM!
He used to know me.
I'd better get going.
Eric, your parents are both here.
You're Alan Grant, aren't you?  I read both of your books.
When InGen cleared out, they left a lot of stuff behind.
Did you read Malcolm's book?
We need to head for the coast.
I have a theory that there's two kinds of boys. Those who want to be astronomers and those who want to be astronauts.
Bonitas.
You know, I've been traveling and I'm very tired. Maybe some other time.
There is no Kirby Enterprises, is there?
Billy!
How did you know?
I got a call from a gentleman who's going to Costa Rica, or thereabouts. If he's to be believed, it's a most, uh, unique expedition.  And very well-funded.
Sorry.  We were saying?
It matches the pictures.
You hear something?
Is there an antidote?
Why didn't you tell us about these guys, Ian?!
I don't believe you.
InGen is a genetics corporation, isn't it?
Ian, you're not insane!  I'm so glad!
Okay, Karen is expecting you in half an hour.  You only have to stay with her one night, she'll put you on a bus in the morning and your mother will be at the station when you get there.
I'll make it up to you this summer. I promise.
Well, is he?
I could come with you.
I don't care about the trials, I want to be with you.  I could be your research assistant, like I was in Austin.
Cancel that, Dieter.
You rally think this'll draw the parent?
Killing lessons?  Heartwarming.
So, you two were just, uh, telling old campfire stories, were you?
Trespassing, sabotage -- you could go to jail just for being here, did you know that?
What?
You know how to work a radio, don't you?
There' no reason for name calling.
What do they want?!
Come on!
This is single-wall construction! It's just a shack!
No.  I'm quite certain you can't.
Because it exists.
You gentlemen feel you have to do this now?
You're going home.  I'm sending a radio call for the boats.  We'll all go down to the lagoon and wait for them.
Born free, as free as the wind blows. As free as the grass grows --
Ian.  It's guano.
That must be interesting.  What drew you there?
Hold it down, Nick!
If we can't stay in the rex's territory, we have to move tonight.
Woah, woah, woah, what the hell, what the hell?
Phones are out too.
The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the spread of the animals is case they ever got off the island, but we could use it now.  Dr. Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism. Animals can't manufacture the amino acid lysine.  Unless they're continually supplied with lysine by us, they'll go into a coma and die.
You shouldn't use my name.
That's up to your guy on the boat.  Seven o'clock tomorrow night, at the east dock. Make sure he got it right.
Please - - let's hear something from the others.  Dr. Grant?  I am sorry - - Dr. Sattler?
Alan, these aren't bones anymore.
Postmortem contraction of the posterior neck ligaments.  Velociraptor?
You know, if you really wanted to scare the kid you could've just pulled a gun on him.
Cheap, cheap, cheap.
The what?
Anything else, you old fossil?
You've got a T-rex!?  He's got a T-rex!  A T-rex!  He said he's- -
Ellie, they're absolutely - - they're moving in herds. They do move in herds!
Oh, shit.
It's just the two raptors, right?  You're sure the third one's contained?
What about the lysine contingency?  We could put that into effect!
I can't wait anymore.  Something went wrong.  I'm going to go get the power back on.
I'm going with you.
C'mon on, this way.
God creates dinosaurs.  God destroys dinosaurs.  God creates man.  Man destroys God.  Man creates dinosaurs.
Faster, faster!
Hola, Juanito
What's this I hear at the airport Hammond's not even here?
Up and down, up and down!
The full fifty mile of perimeter fence are in place?
I don't believe it.  I expected you to come down here and defend me from these characters and the only one I've got on my side it the bloodsucking lawyer!?
And his book was a lot fatter than yours.
So am I going to help you with your foot?
You'll probably be safe enough  on your own --
Straight-A brainiac!
A Do-you-think-he-saurus. What do you call a blind dinosaur's dog?
I can't!  I'm scared!
What's to be scared about?  It's just a little hiccup in the power.
Well, I'm afraid I do.  There's one, a particular pebble in my shoe.  He represents my investors.  He says they insist on outside opinions.
Blood temperature feels like high eighties.
Yes, yes, yes, which is why we take extreme precautions. They viewing area below us will have eight-inch tempered glass set in reinforced steel frames to - -
He's knocked out!  He's knocked out!  Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!  Daddy, daddy!
Liar!  You said you wouldn't leave!
It's safe?
Let's go!
Do as he says!  The power's coming back, Timmy!
Well?
We miss you.
I don't know, I don't know.  I'm sorry - -
Hey Lex, ahhhchooo!  Hey Lex, com here.
That's not funny.
Hello?
Chain saws.
That's not true...
Mister Biller?
I didn't think there were any houses up here...
There doesn't seem to be any water damage. Kind of cozy, actually.
Quite a circus.
What?
It's still on.
What are the charges?
I thought that was Ted Bundy.
That's right... it... it came right out of his chest...
He wets the bed?
Not much here. Jason was brought in a couple more times for insomnia... that's about it.
How do we prove it?
Well, that's it. He'll be asleep in a few minutes, but his first REM-cycle probably won't kick in for another hour or so.  Is there a place we can get something to eat in this town?
There's nothing to see here. He sleeps... we record it. That's all that happens.
Uh-huh...
Add it to the list.
It's all right. I'm simply in shock... this is what happens to people when they experience events they can't understand or comprehend. The mind shuts down temporarily and tries to shield itself from the horrific imagery it's been exposed to.  I'm going to need a lot of therapy.
So Krueger thinks Jason's dead... leaves him in the lake... but the boy actually wakes up on the shore... crawls off into the woods... where he lives the rest of his life alone.
Krueger's in the real world... maybe he's mortal, like us.
How long will the effect last?
What happened? Where's Jason?
Have you worked here long?
-- Merely in the interests of order.
Just what you've published.
Gabriela was right -- it's easier for me to understand suicide. I'm a practicing suicide.
These strange stories you write -- they come naturally, do they?
That would be even worse -- it would be a compromise.
-- You appreciate my writing.
Will you do me a favor then?
A true friend would do it.
In an organization as efficient as ours, if a document once in a great while gets lost it might never be found at all.
Are you looking for Gabriela Rossmann?
Good morning --  Or should I say good afternoon?
You've been with the firm for nearly nine years.  You've done your work diligently, there are no complaints on that score.  But there's more to the job than the work -- there are other people to consider -- and frankly, Kafka, we eel your social situation could bear improving.
Was there something else?
No, there's only one report to complete.  I'll be doing it myself and submitting it to the Castle today or tomorrow.
I'm Kafka -- I work upstairs in Accident --
You're a friend of Eduard Raban's.
Well -- nice to know life exists outside the office.
What?
The police would know the difference, wouldn't they?
I'm collecting Eduard's things. If there's anything you want, take it or I'll give it to charity.
Or what if there really <u>was</u> an error? -- I don't know what kind -- any kind that needed correcting -- and what if Burgel was responsible for it?  One mistake -- even a small one in a firm like ours -- it could cost him a promotion.
Where you've been employed for seven years.
Was he depressed?
His landlady knew of no other friends to refer us to.
But that's just my point -- she was more than upset, she was livid. She slammed every door on her way downstairs -- except that one.  I was just behind her and I didn't even hear that one <u>shut</u> -- not at all.
Do you?
This is the cross-reference of clerks who've worked on Orlac claims?
What good are records if they're not open for public inspection?
Women are all you have on your mind!
I understand he was wounded in the lung.
Then that's the place for us!
Get the hell out of here.''!
He's grubbing for money, father.
I can't imagine you crying.
Oh Jesus ... you took it.
Ann ... Ann!
They're stoking the boilers. As soon as we've got some steam, we're outta here.
Pleased to meet you ... Hi, bow's it going? Pleased to meet you! Hi, Carl Denham ... How's it going?
You are most kind. We will be proud to assist you!
They were just tasting the berries.
Denham! Go back to the wall ... Tell'em to give me twelve hours to get back with Ann!
Did you fear for your life?
It must have been terrifying?
What's that?
Mm.
I do not love him.
Well I have to close up now.
Arlyn and Jane commited suicide. He said they commited suicide.
Is that why Klute didn't tell me?
Is that what he set me up for? Everything he's told me from the beginning? -- don't worry, don't --
I don't have to look at anything. I don't have --
You said that.
Is it the shakedown hon? You picked a loser, I just don't have it.
You remind me of my uncle.
What about the other things you've reported? --  -- being followed on the --
Klute, tell me, what's your bag? Are you a talker, or a button man or a doubler, or maybe you like them very young -- children -- or get your chest walked around with high-heeled shoes, or have us watch you tinkle? Or --
Gee I hope this doesn't make my cold any worse.
I thought you could trick me for those tapes. Don't you get lonely in that little green room? Or let me get you someone; I have terrific friends, wild.
You asked me where I got that date with the dumper -- Frank sent me on it.
I thought you were going back to the apartment.
What're you gonna do next?
You asked if there was anything more you could help me with.
Did she and Jane McKenna know each other?
How can you do it to yourself?
Ligourin: How could you do it?
You're right, I don't understand. Explain it to me.  You were scared. Arlyn Page, that scared you. Well it should; that's death. So what did you do, you ran straight for it, death. Ligourin kills women.
I am scared. The things I do. The things I could do to you.
Spangler says we have a relationship.
Look -- yes. I mean thanks, but -- don't you think we better be realistic?
How can you not think so? You know the things I can do.
Look, why should it be yes or no? Can't we keep it going and see? I mean we can keep in touch and visit each other and see. People do that, that's realistic.
You don't believe that either, do you? Why can't you see my side?
You said Trask was arranging laboratory work. Police laboratory. Anything from that?
It's a beautiful day in Tuscarora - I don't envy you that humidity in the city.
I've always respected Bree.  I'd like to make something clear.
We grew up together. Kids.
No.
That's a lot of people to die unknown.
Well?
But what reason could he have? What possible reason?
It's damn lucky you didn't have the dossier on Cable here.
Does that distress you?
Oh, sure.  Here, this can be mommy.
Greatest.
Show.
When is mommy coming back?
You forgot the milk.
Okay...Same as usual...
Sure.  Too much birthday cake, right?
Mom, I mean dad...
I'm sorry.
I want a pizza.
There, okay? Now that's just plain old hamburger.
Then eat around it.
Now listen to me, young man. Do you know what I had to go through to put this goddamn food on the goddamn table?
Not on your life.  That's it. I've had it with crap around this house.  From now on, no more pizza!  Get it?  Starting right now you can eat real food like a normal human being!
Is mom ever coming back?
See you in the morning light.
Billy.   This is Dr. Alvarez. She would like to talk to you.
Objection.
Is that really your chair?
Mom--I mean, dad?
Daddy!  You're home early.  Did you get fired again?
I'll send your toys there and I'm sure you'll get some new ones.
Objection!  I must ask that the counsel be prevented from harassing the witness.
Mrs. Kramer, do you love your child?
Objection!
Objection!
Now then, Mr. O'Connor, how long did Ted Kramer work for you?
And did you have a close personal relationship?
There might be something at J. Walter Thompson.  But...  ...I don't think they're really serious.  The position's been open for two months and...  They may just be on a fishing expedition.  I'm sure you'll be much happier if you wait until after the first--
Mis-ter Kramer, it's...  ...almost four now.  It's the Friday before Christmas.  Nobody is going to want to--
Did he ever fail to provide for you?
My American Express...My Bloomingdale's Credit Card... My check book--
I took two thousand out of the savings account.  That was what I had in the bank when we got married.
Look, it's not your fault, okay? It's me.  It's my fault--you just married the wrong person.
You just don't get it, do you?  I - am - really - and - truly - leaving - you.
I am not!  I'm a terrible mother! I'm an awful mother.  I yell at him all the time.  I have no patience.  No...No.  He's better off without me.  Ted, I've got to go...I've got to go.
Hello, Ted.  You look well.
I can't help but feel somehow... it's my fault.  I keep thinking I could've done something-- stopped it...
Watching my son...Ted, I've been living in New York for the past two months.
Joanna, go be a mother.  Get married, have kids.  Don't get married, have kids.  Do whatever you want.  I don't give a damn. Just leave me out of it--and leave my baby out of it.
Ted, when we got married it was because I was twenty-seven years old and I thought I should get married and...when I had Billy it was because I thought I should have a baby...and I guess all I did was mess up my life and your life and--
Only can I still see him?
Wow!
Jesus Christ.  That's a real blockbuster.  I always figured you guys had it made.
Listen, don't let it get you down.  You're going to be fine.
Yes.
So...what's so terrible about that?
No.  No, I don't believe it. Jim O'Connor would never let anything like that happen.  He gave me my shot in this business. If it wasn't for Jim O'Connor I'd be--I don't know where I'd be. He's a wonderful man...
So, naturally, you assume that since Joanna left, that would be a compelling point against her, right?
I've got a lot more than twenty minutes to kill.
Three months.  How can you tell?
Mr. Lombardo from packaging wants to meet on Friday.
Look, she walked out on her own child, right?  That's desertion, right? Mr. Shaunessy, I'm telling you it's an open and shut case.
Good.  You've hired yourself a hell of a lawyer, Mr. Kramer.  How old is the child?
Oh, no..
What if I fight it?
Can you describe the relationship between Mr. Kramer and his son?
Ted?  They've set the court date. I just heard today...It's...  January sixth.
All right, Thelma, you want to know what's going on?  I'll tell you what's going on.  I'll tell you exactly what's going on.
I walk in the house and before I can say "How are you?", "Did you have a nice day?" before I can say anything.   Pow she's out the door.
Yeah, she said it wasn't any use talking anymore.
Things? What kind of things?
Boy, you guys are really something, y'know?  I'd like to know one thing, okay--just one little thing.  Did you tell Joanna she should leave me?
You're on your own, understand?
California?
He's okay...Thel, can I ask you a favor?
Please go away, Thel...I...I just have to be by myself for a little while...
We must go, Holiness.
Please, come, Holiness.
Your people are very brave. They are fighting the Chinese. No one can stop them. Not even me.
Mama, my story.
Your father had been very ill, we thought he would die, and some animals had died.
And that day, your father got better. He named you Lhamo. "The Protector."
I am sorry, Lhamo.
I do, now.
You must also do something about the public meetings. I see this, memorandum circulating, with Tibetan grievances.
Plans for absorbing the Tibetan army into the People's Army will soon be finalized.
Do you have plans to return soon, Dalai Lama?
Of the Tibetan delegations sent abroad, all have been turned away.
So, we must face China and all her might alone.
Ngabo did not have the state seal. He could not sign.
Your Prime Ministers, support the proposal that you return to Lhasa. On the opposite hand, some officials urge you not to return. They believe you should leave now, for India.
I need to squeeze this brain.
Is that big?
Will we be in this war?
I need to know what you know. I am no longer a child.
Quite simple. Yes. Good.
What is the size of our army, now?
Has anyone died?
I am scared.
I have always asked for plain information. Just the truth.
I am happy to hear you say this, Chairman Mao. I have created a reform committee to investigate grievances and we have abolished Inherited Tax, and forgiven all money owed the Government by people who are unable to pay.
You know, I have great respect for your Lord Buddha. He was anti-caste. Anti-corruption. Anti-exploitation. For some, politics and religion can mix.
I have been greatly impressed by your accomplishments. Industrial progress. Great efficiency. Your people are capable and courteous.
Me?
What do you think?
I want to be a shepherd, taking those goats and cows out to the hillside.
Why is this? What is happening? Tell me!
You must study very hard, do not neglect the holy things during this time.
We have had fun, you and I. Fun for a little boy in an old palace.
You, kill me?
This is not a fight to put bread just in one's own mouth. This is a fight for Tibet.
What should I do about my doubt, Teacher?
I mean, my doubt. Why me? Am I Him?
Hmm.
Much too young.
Oh, my husband passed away almost two years ago.
You're a beautiful woman.
It seems like we're getting lower.
I might get a shot.
Around here.  Yeah.
<u>No</u>!!  What's with digging the holes?
Could <u>she</u> stay, we've tentatively scheduled intercourse.
I do <u>not</u> like you.
I keep telling you, they <u>can</u> come on land, I don't wanna wake up in the middle of the night--
Promise you won't kill me, first.
Maybe he doesn't play well with others.
What's that?
Where is he?!
No way.
And again.  How would you get him on land?
Keep enough tension to hold him up, Hector, we don't know if he can swim.
You take care.
But they're nighttime hunters, Hector, he'd probably be on land now anyway.
Two years married, divorced, used to be a lawyer, quit, I'm still waiting on his sperm count.
They're not going to be able to snag him in pitmans.  Tranq him in water, he drowns.
You're gonna be okay.
Oh my God.
What are you doing?
Whatever's out there <u>did</u> flip over a canoe--
It's too dangerous for--
That was an awful thing to say to me.
No.  U.S. Wildlife is on their way.
I was trying to pay you a compliment, I was guising it as science 'cause I know you're comfortable in that arena. Science.
Why he's that <u>big</u>, I don't know. Why he's <u>here</u>... the wetlands are being developed, crocodiles are moving.  Australia, Fiji, the things have started to cross oceans.
That's why you're here.  To get in the middle of something?
I'm gonna get ticks.  I know it. They're drawn to me.  I got a thing about ticks.
Really--
Calm down.
It can't work.
Hector!!
No.
That was... y'know if the guy asks me can she kiss, now I'll be able to tell him if you can.
We set?
Hank.  The little cannon you brought, get it.  Guard the shoreline.  Otherwise, we're done. We made the I.D., our job is finished.
They won't be here till at least noon.  We got a few hours to kill.
Thanks for your help.
He just came up screaming.
I wouldn't.
Is this 'spose to make me take him more serious?
Was that like a homo-sexual remark?
He may be a kook but he's also been all over the world with them.  He even swam in the Grimetti with killer Niles all around him, he never got nipped.
What is this?
What was that?
Hank!
Kelly.
Hi.  Listen.  Could I steal you a second?
I was working for you when "us" started, what's--
Yeah, that part.  There's... somebody who's um...
Sorry?
This was Myra's idea, wasn't it? Get me out of the office for a few days, until--
Really?  I never realized he was so psychic, how could he detect that, did he tell you there's somebody else?
You missed Fourth Amendment law. Unlawful seizure, real juicy stuff. Where were you all afternoon?
What girl?
Agent Starling! Telephone!
I'll get you out! Just be quiet so I can hear. Shut that dog up.  Is there a ladder? Is there a rope?
I'm sure it's a great town, Dr. Chilton, but my instructions are to talk to Lecter and report back this afternoon.
Dr. Chilton - if Lecter feels you're his enemy - as you've said - then maybe I'll have more luck by myself. What do you think?
Your instructions are what I'm giving you now. Jack Crawford answers to the Director, and the Director answers to me. My God, Crawford's losing it...! He shouldn't even be on this, with his wife sick as she is... How the hell did you get in here, anyway? He gave you - what? Some kind of special ID? Let's have it.
Mr. Yow, if this door should fall down -ha ha! - or anything else - would you be kind enough to call this number? It's our Baltimore field office. They know you're here with me... Do you understand?
Mr. Yow? Oh Mr. Yow...? It looks like somebody is sitting in this car.
Your instructors tell me you're doing well. Top quarter of the class.
Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter. Dr. Chilton at the asylum will go over the physical procedures used with him. Do not deviate from them, for any reason. You tell him nothing personal, Starling. Believe me, you don't want Hannibal Lecter inside your head... Just do your job, but never forget what he is.
I've read your interim memo on Lecter. You sure you've left nothing out?
Okay, Starling. Let's have it.
When I told that sheriff we shouldn't talk in front of a woman, that really burned you, didn't it?  That was just smoke, Starling, I had to get rid of him. You did well in there.
The other girls are in the ground. Exhumations are upsetting for the families. I'll do it if I have to, but -
Are you in trouble over this, Mr. Crawford? Can Senator Martin do something to you?
All his victims are women... His obsession is women, he lives to hunt women. But not one women is hunting him - except me. I can walk in a woman's room and know three times as much about her as a man would.  I have to go to Belvedere.
That's why they're all so big - because he needs a lot of skin! He keeps them alive to starve them awhile - to loosen their skin, so that -
This Gumb's a real beauty. Slaughtered both his grandparents when he was twelve, and did nine years in juvenile psychiatric. Where, Starling, he took vocational rehab, and learned a useful trade...
Take a bow. Customs had some paper on his alias. They stopped a carton two years ago at LAX - live caterpillars from Surinam. The addressee was "John Grant." Calumet Power & Light's given us two possible residences under that alias. We're hitting one, Chicago SWAT's taking the other.
What do you do when you're not detecting, Officer Starling?
They said she was just rags, like somebody -
Oh sure, me'n Pam Malavesi used to help her do alterations for old Mrs. Lippman. Lots of people worked for her, she had the business from all these retail stores? But she was like, totally old, it was more'n she could handle.
You get to travel around and stuff? I mean, better places then this?
Doctor, we have a hard problem in psychological profiling. I want to ask for your help with a questionnaire.
I see. I myself cannot. You use Evyan skin cream, and sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps, but not today. You brought your best bag, though, didn't you?
Oh, Officer Starling... do you think you can dissect me with this blunt little tool?
I would not have had that happen to you. Discourtesy is - unspeakably ugly to me.
His real name is Benjamin Raspail. A former patient of mine, whose romantic attachments ran to, shall we say, the exotic...? I didn't kill him, merely tucked him away. Very much as I found him, in that ridiculous car, in his own garage, after he's missed three appointments. You'd have him under "Missing Person" - which, in poor Raspail's case, could hardly be more true.
And have them clomping about in my life? Oh dear, no... At that time I still had certain private amusements of my own.  How did you feel when you saw him, Clarice? May I call you Clarice?
Do you have something you use, when you need to get up your courage? Memories, tableaux... scenes from your early life?
Jack Crawford is helping your career, isn't he? Apparently he likes you. And you like him, too.
Your first lie to me, Clarice. How sad. Tell me - do you think Crawford wants you, sexually? True, he's much older, but - do you think he visualizes... scenarios, exchanges...? Fucking you?
They all were.
The death of my father.
Quid pro quo, Doctor.
Two months.
On what basis would they reject him?
Then tell me how.
He kills w-
No, he covets. That's his nature. And how do we begin to covet, Clarice? Do we seek out things to covet? Make an effort to answer.
I'll listen now. After your father's murder, you were orphaned. You were ten years old. You went to live with cousins, on a sheep and horse ranch in Montana. And - ?
I heard a strange sound...
What did you do?
So you ran away...
Thank you, Clarice.
Senator Martin...! You can't trust Jack Crawford or Clarice Starling. It's such a game with these people. They're determined to get the arrest for themselves. The "collar," I think they say.
Yes, miss.
The Ottawa are gone.
I do not remember them. I was one or two.
My father sent Uncas & I to Reverend Wheelock's school when I was ten. So we would know both worlds... though we were told only bother learning readin' & arithmetic from yours.
Mr Poe?
Webb's reinforcements will arrive or not.  If they do not arrive, the fort will fall. If that happens, stay close to your father.  The French will protect the officer class among the English.
Listen. Submit. You hear me?  You're strong. You stay alive. I will find you...  no matter how far, how long it takes...
The man encouraged the colonials to desert in this very room, in my presence. He is guilty of sedition and must be tried and hanged like any other criminal, regardless of what he did for my children.
You do not know what you are saying!
You still have an aversion to the water?
Some say that's the way of it.
Cousin Eugenie, my father, but...
Will you consider that?
Yes. Go ahead.
Head for... for the white water.
Then what?
I believe if they set aside their law as and when they wish, their law no longer has rightful authority over us. All they have over us is tyranny, then. And I'll stay here no longer.  No force on earth will keep me here... Anyone caught leavin' the fort could be shot. So each man make your own decision... Those who are goin', be back here in an hour.
Got a reason to stay.
A man, here, can make a run straight through to Webb.
That judgment is not more important than their right under agreement with Webb to defend their farms & families... Major Heyward was at John Cameron's. He saw what it was.
I didn't experience anything so surprising from Bristol to Albany as what I witnessed here today.
Yes, sir.
Sergeant Major!
No. Stop in the glade just ahead! When the ladies are rested, we will proceed. Do you understand?
Yes.
Yes.
That's where a lead bullet has torn you.
My son Magua's pain is my pain.
Munro would. But General Webb will not send their soldiers across the salt lake.  Having let them go, I fear I will only fight the same men again when I move south.  And yet, I cannot break the terms of the capitulation and sully the lilies of France...
My colors?
Qui vive?
C'est bien, vous vous promenez bien matin, monsieur!
Are you planning on working tomorrow?
Dead?  This morning you said he had some skin disorder.
Here.  Put this on.  You examine him.
The mask is because you think it might be...catching?
They found this?
Be careful with it.
I've been looking at the duty roster...at the shack hours outstanding...
We're getting out of here just in time.
That's why there's a dead one on the ship.  It ran out of blood.
Whatever made you want to do a tour down here?
Everybody in corporate training serves a tour on the line.  Sup- posed to hone leadership skills or something.
Less than an hour.  It's ruptured an air duct.
No!
Thank you, Martin.
Well, according to Maritime law, you, as commander of the Shack have the authority to dispose of the body.  However, the company doesn't want you to do that.
What're you saying?  That we're not even going to be picked up tomorrow?
Made your million, yet?
If he had his blinkers on--
Who else...Sixpack.
Yes sir...
So that's all you do?...
Oooooh.  Damn!  Not so loud. Turn down the music.
Yeah?  How'd the kid hold up?
Hey!...I feel something. It's moving!  He's alive!
It's Sixpack!
How'd you do that?
Yes sir, ain't that where we usually go when we're sick?
Bigger than DeJesus?  How?
The monster appears to be a genetic aberration...
What is it?
My pocket.  Check my pocket, will ya, honey?
The latch is screwed up.  Or the hinge.
So how long do you have to wait 'till you see a return?
The odds are one hundred to one so all we need is five grand.
At the bottom of a bottle and has been for two days; it's hit him hard.
Twenty-five from me, Tom, Soap and yourself; a hundred grand to the pound. You don't need to count it.
He'll care all right. That was going to be his money. Whether he cares about us is different. Pass your phone.
What's that?
No, I asked you to give me a refreshing drink. I wasn't expecting a fucking rainforest; you could fall in love with an orang-utan in that.
Well whatever it is, could you get your man to turn the TV down?
I thought you said no staff, Bazza!
I don't know what you mean.
Inside, out-fuckin'-side. I don't give a shit, you get those guns because if you don't . . .
JD.
The boys had 'em. I know you like these things; wondered if you wanted them?
Have you counted the money?
They were going to pay, then?
Son, have a look in his locker.
Yeah?
What can I do for you?
Jesus, I have heard about him.
I want you to search the house for bugs. I mean I want you to strip it.
There's nothing to worry about, it's going to be easy.
My neck, Dog.  That's the last bag?
Right, his leg's going now.
Do you want me to take his leg off? Where's the fourth?
And the weed?
Are you sure you can afford twenty-five?
And we will just have to find out who's going to be carrying them.
Where the fuck are they going? To butcher a sheep? I thought this was a robbery.
No I fucking don't! You can't make a cup of tea, Edward.
Well, what's going on?
You see it's not easy to take a seat at this table; the money involved has to be a hundred grand upwards and there is no shortage of punters.
What the hell are you doing here?
Everything all right out there, Tom?
You and me, Tom.
Tom, don't mess around, let's go.
The only item that connects us with the crime is sitting in your car which is sitting outside?
Go on.
Yes?
Hello, can I help you?
And that does include the amp?
Not normal weed. This is some fucked-up skunk class A. I can't think let alone move shit.
Jews don't celebrate Christmas, Tom.
You got a ticket already and, if you don't move it now, sir, we will move it for you.
Look. Go on, look.
What have you come as?
What's left over?'
There's six black cocks sitting on the side of the road. How many beaks have they got between them?
That's right. So how many whiskers has the little white kitten got?
What are you carrying, Willy?
Who'd want to be friends with that bunch of pachuco wannabes?
Joanie Orozco's telling the whole school she's like desperately in love with Santo Guerra.
So I'm worried about you. I don't want you to end up in jail like your friends.
Then how would you explain the fact that out of one hundred twenty people we tested, you're the only one who came up positive for drugs?
Do you believe in what we're doing here, Private Johnson?
What exactly do you think your job is, Private?
Why don't you start with that?
It's not our job to get involved in your personal life, but when it interferes with the training here--
Out of the Army?
You're dismissed.
And you and Private Graves--
Sam the Man.
Nice job.
Charley Wade.
--it didn't come out of a cereal box.
You got a cause of death?
You uhm--you remember what old Buddy carried for a side arm?
That's not the point.
I'm not picking it up.
Whole different story; isn't it?
You look good--
You were in a fight--
You didn't--uhm--you didn't have one of your fires, did you? The stuff I left in the garage--some of it was my father's--
350 pounds.
Hey, it's the General.
Come on in--
Where'd he get all this?
You weren't in here tonight, were you?
They teaching that now?  Good. Only a couple of 'em held out--this man, John Horse, and his friend Wild Cat, and a fella name of Osceola. Army put all of them in prison and Osceola died, but them other two escaped and put together a fighting band and held out another ten, fifteen years. Beat Zach Taylor and a thousand troops at Lake Okeechobee.
You didn't go telling your father you were here?
PDA?
Dad, I talked to the track coach--
Tanks, huh?
This place is a gold mine.
You finding lots of cactus and shit?
Looks like a lot of cactus to me.
The Sheriff says we shouldn't touch anything,
It's a .45.
So where does that put us?
--but I gotta say I think there's something to this cold climate business. I mean, you go to the beach- what do you do? Drink a few beers, wait for a fish to flop up on the sand. Can't build no civilization that way. You got a hard winter coming, though, you got to plan ahead, and that gives your cerebral cortex a workout.
You joke about it, Sam, but we are in a state of crisis. The lines of demarcation has gotten fuzzy--to run a sucessfull civilization you got to have lines of demarcation between right and wrong, between this one and that one--your Daddy understood that. He was like the whatchacallit-- the referee for this damn menudo we got down here. He understood how most people don't want their sugar and salt in the same jar.
Yeah. I bet he would.
So.
Right.
I gonna meet that family of yours?
Not much, jefe. Some watermelons.
Eladio Cruz.
Is very beautiful, your car.
In English, Enrique. We're in the United States--
No! No puede hacer esto--[You can't do that--]
I thought you were married!
This girl has a child?
Big day coming up--I wish we'd have thought of it while he was still living. But he went so unexpected.
Which is why we need to talk to you about the new jail--just so we're all on the same page.
That's a matter of interpretation--
Oh--he come to an accommodation. Money doesn't always need to change hands to keep the wheels turning.
I haven't been out here for a while.
Was it Davy Crockett or Jim Bowie?
And Buddy was one of them.
Morning, Hollis.
Yeah, and my mother was a saint. For fifteen years the whole damn town knew he had another woman on the side. Stole ten thousand dollars to set her up in business. But hell, what's that? You got a problem? Buddy'll fix it. Facing some time in jail? Buddy'll knock half of it off-- if you do what he says, when he says. You got some business that's not exactly legal? Talk to Buddy--
Don't think the Rangers are likely to find out any more than they already have.
He agreed it wasn't exactly news--
There was a mandate in the last election--
How 'bout the Sheriff?
Mami, how old were you when my father--
Right. When he was killed.
There must have been somebody.
You had to deal with him in running the club.
No. Is he sick?
Buddy was more a part of the big picture--county political machine, chamber of commerce, zoning board if I kept those people happy, he was pretty much on my side.  Whenever somebody thought--they start up another bar for the black  folks, they'd be--how should I put this? They'd be officially discouraged.
Not if you have half a brain in your head.
I could name five girls at school who have one just like it--
You built our patio while you  were on the county?
I've heard Wade was a bit tough on the Mexicans--
Got him here?
It can happen so sudden, can't it? Being left out on your own.
Yeah?
Yeah.
I didn't want to be going around your back.
We had about a dozen wets come over just upriver. They ran into one of our posts--it was like a breakshot on a pool table, illegals runnin' every which way.
We'll get 'em--  So you livin' out here now?
I heard about that deal for your father--You must be real proud.
One of Cleroe Payne's boys?
He doesn't need to know all my business.
Maybe they're not tricks.
I saw him on T.V.  Some kid got possessed and he saved the little bastard's life.
You didn't think it was just going to be you and me?  A lot of people believed in Nix. They haven't forgotten his promise.
Anything?
If you've lied to me to me --
Will you come to him on your knees?
Ever watched a man die?  If you watch very closely, you can sometimes see the soul escaping. And if you're very quick, you can catch it.
And are you afraid?
Yes.  They weren't close, but they saw each other once in a while.  I think Philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards.
What's the connection?
I didn't marry him for love, Mr. D'Amour.  Tonight?
He's good.
I'm sorry I got into this too late. But if you want me to stick around, maybe dig where the cops don't look...
Well... how about some of the other illusionists?
What did you find?
What then?
I was twelve.  Nix took me hostage, to get Swann to come to him.
Are you all right?
... oh... God...
Don't look.
What the fuck?
What were you doing up there?
With what?
What's the difference?
Left alone?  Somebody's been murdered.
Fuck regrettable!  I want to know why.
I like to know why things happen.
I want to speak to Dorothea.
Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake.
D'Amour --
Don't bother.
Oh yes.  We have to agree what's real and what's not. That's what holds us together.
Hold on.
Harry D'Amour.
Are they all in the business?
How the fuck do you do that?
I don't think so.  You need me alive.
Oh yeah?
Who else did?  Did Valentin?
They got here before us.
The case is closed. Harry. Tapert's given us a full confession.  Get your ass back to Mew York.
One question.
I've got so much power to give you, Swann.  All you have to do is...beg.
Don't touch me.  He's got... got into my head.
Yeah, they told me.
It takes a while to figure it out. I'm sure you will, though.
Hi again, how's it going?
A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Calling - are you reading this?
Hans was very attentive to you.
Why do they switch the r's and l's here?
No one ever tells you that...
That's nice. My parents were always traveling, they weren't around so much.
I know.
You are.
You can't get sushi anywhere in Japan after 2 o'clock. Did you know that?
Charlotte?
You're leaving right now?
Lydia?
Lydia, I went to this great house tonight, this guy designed and built, you would have loved it.
He was this fashion guy, and there were all these Japanese fashion people- it's a whole other world, and I was talking to these Japanese surfers... He was playing all this great music- I have to find out what it was...
It's four in the morning... I'm going to go to sleep.
Hi, Lydia.
That's not what I'm talking about.
I don't know... I want to be more healthy. I want to eat better.
You know, eat healthier.
Oh, come on.
Hello?
When are you coming home?
Her ballet recital is Saturday, don't forget.
Ok.
Its just a pseudonym, it doesn't matter.
I gotta go meet Kelly for a drink downstairs. She wants to talk about some photo thing.
You smell weird.
A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Character and calling? Is this yours?
You don't have to be embarrassed.
Yeah, I know you have to work the whole time, I'll probably have more fun here. I'll call Charlie and those guys.
I miss you.
Shi... Sorry, honey.  I was having the weirdest dream.
Peter, where are you?
What're these?
Nonsense, it's all of our home.  So how's work treating you?
You know, I made a reservation at Marco's for Peter's birthday dinner, but maybe you should cater it.
Seemed...on edge.
I can take care of myself.
The patient was in great distress. Naturally he was...yelling.
I don't mean to belittle you, but we've been through this before.  Satan is not what you think he is.  Satan is not some creature.
Please, Maya.  I'm trying to get us into the next century and you insist on this medieval nonsense.
I've had it.  Townsend's dead.  The police are calling and now I see you having a scene in front of the children. I'm sorry, Maya, you've been with us for many years, but effective immediately, I'm rescinding your right to live at the church.
You'll do it?
How're you doing?  Looking lovely as always.
Peter.  Your life must matter to you because it matters to all of us who love you.
You lied to me my whole life. Everything you said, everything you did.
Father!  Thank God you're better!  I really need your help.  We've only got a few more hours.
We won because Christ...triumphed over Satan?
I took one of those home pregnancy tests, but I don't want to tell him. I'm RH negative.  My blood type is negative...  If he's RH positive, I'll have to terminate.
Thirteen.  The last time, can you believe it?  This is how he says "Goodbye?"
Two negatives always make a positive.
Oh my God!
May I help you?
And also that...
And this is evil?  The guy had an aneurysm and now he's in a coma.
What?!?!
Trick him.
You should think about getting professional help.
You're about to become the anti-Christ who is born unholy and becomes the door to eternal suffering in this world.
Yes, I know.
So what?
Peter, let go of the chair!
Hang on, get it up, go on, higher.
There's nothing else here.
I'm scared I'm slipping back.
No oxygen to the brain.
What about after?
I'll be all right.  Peter, at the very end, I think Father was back.  I saw it in his eyes.
Hello?
I'd appreciate it if you'd put that back.
Good of you to stop by.
Peter, you're now writing a book about the Viznick case.  You seem to be making a career of studying sensational murderers.  I have to ask, how does it make you feel when you sit in courtrooms day after day, face to face with alleged killers?
It's as if you are saying the closer you get to evil, the less evil it becomes.
Hey!  Mr. big shot.
Thanks again for everything.
We hauled her in earlier but didn't have anything hard to tie her to Townsend. Far as the priest goes, he won't be bothering you.  Suffered a complete mental breakdown, during - get this - during an exorcism.
I hate it.
Hi.
Engaged.
I'm angry because I want a mother, not Martha Stewart.
So you're still breast-feeding?
Oh, me too.  I used to cook for my friends' parties and things back in Atlanta.
You could've given up after you threw that ball away.  But you kept your head and you showed real heart.
That was nice.
I don't wanna see that.
I don't know sometimes.
Mom's going to hate it.
Like you don't give her a hard time.
You need to.  She's alone in this house all day, taking care of Dad and your ungrateful behind.
I found you someone.
You ever been in love?
You shoot like a girl.
But?
Thanks.
Can you take that damn thing off the table.
What do I have to do?
I don't like flowers.
So?
What's that?
Why she gotta be a ho, just cause she wants to get with me.
So who you going to the dance with, Spalding?
You having fun?
So what dead-end street did you and Shawnee hit?
Well, I'm sure she kept her word and left you satisfied.
Why?
What?
Clothes.
I...can't.
Didn't realize you were watching the clock.
Nah.  Don't sweat it.
I've been trying to find you all day.
he's just playing, Q...
You weren't at my game.
Oh, Kerry, this is Monica.  Monica, Kerry.
Least you got your priorities straight.
Alright.  I heard you were in Spain.
So, how's pro-ball, Europe?
Yeah, and Quincy, good luck with your knee, and everything.
Who's this guy I always see her around?
Strong enough to get you down the aisle?
You had a rough couple years, that's all.
Cause I don't get it.
You asked me what was missing.
I'll play you.
What's that supposed to be, psychology?
No.
You just got back from a four game road trip.
You said you'd think about going back to get your degree.
The doctor'll be back in a minute.
Almost didn't recognize you with your hair like that.  How you been?
You hearing me?
Where's your dad?
Guess he talked to you.
Quincy, please...
You work too hard, Pop.
What people?
Well, tell them to mind their damn business.  You're smart enough to get a degree.
You know how much higher the play level is in the NBA?  Give yourself time to develop, Quincy.  Get an education.  The NBA ain't going nowhere.
I just told you.
Still is, so let yourself out.
Lucky kid.
I ain't a damn liar.
Yeah.
How are you paying tor the braces, Donnie?
It's been the same fuckin' thing for thirty years, Burt --
C'mon, Jimmy, snap up, snap up --
Call 911, Mary, do it right now.
Hey, Janet, it's Chad.
Well can you connect me to someone else?
My mother had breast cancer.
It was scary though.
Wanna call me a slut now, something?
What the fuck do you want?
Why are you here, why are you doing this? Coming in here -- you wanna call me a whore?
Yeah, yeah right -- what the fuck are doing?  WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING IN MY HOUSE?
I'M NOT CRAZY.  You're the one.  You're the one who's wrong.  You're the one --
GET THE FUCK OUT.
...Hello...?
uh...uh...What is it?
Yes.
For what?
No.
No.
Yeah.
I like iced coffee, generally, but a day like this, rain and what not, I enjoy a warm cup --
You take cream or sugar?
Yeah.
Many times, in damestic abuse situations the young lady is afraid to speak, but I have to tell you that, being a police officer, I've seen it happen: Young woman afraid to speak, next thing you know, I'm gettin' a call on the radio, I got a 422 --
Ok, ok. I'm back.
Ok, then.  Keep your chin up and your music down, alright?
No.
I don't know.  I haven't thought about it -- you know what -- that's not true -- I have thought about it.  I've thought about going on a date with you since you opened the door.
Eight o'clock?
It's my favorite place --
Wow....huh..."...piss and shit..."
I'm gonna run to the bathroom for a minute...maybe just --
Yeah, of course.
I'll take everything at face value. I'll be a good listener to you.
Hello.  You're back again, huh?
-- can I get you?
GIVE US YOUR MONEY MAN.
BULLSHIT, BULLSHIT DAD WE GOTTA GET HIS MONEY --
GIVE US YOUR MONEY, KID.
DADDY, FUCK, DADDY, DON'T GET MAD AT ME. DON'T GET MAD AT ME --  JUST GIMME YOUR MONEY.
How much you pay me for my help?
You wanna take my statement, I'll perform for you, gotta get paid though, gotta get PAID.
No school today.  My teacher got sick.
Nope.  So what'd they find out in there?
Have you ever been to Juvenille Hall?

Doc it's Janet.
You look like you've got money in your pocket.
Is it real love?
That's right.
It was the lovely Samuel Johnson who also spoke of a fella "Who was not only dull but a cause of dullness in others."
I confuse melancholy and depression sometimes....
I love you.  I love you and I'm sick.  I'II talk to you....I'll talk to you tommorrow.  I'm getting corrective oral surgery tomorrow.  For my teeth.  For my teeth and for you....for you so we can speak. You have braces.  Me too.  Me too.  I'm getting braces, too.  For you.  For you, dear Brad. And I don't have any money.  And I don't have any money now but I'II get it...I will for you, Brad.  I love you, Brad.  Brad the Bartender.  You wanna love me back?  Love me back and I'll be good to you.  I'II be god damn good for you. And I won't be mad if you don't know who said what. I won't punish you if you get the answer wrong. I can teach and tell you: Samuel Johnson.
Brad, I know you don't love me now --
This is so fucked, Solomon. I don't deserve this.
And how much is braces?
-- he's fucking dying, he's dying as we're sitting here and there isn't a fucking thing -- jesus, how can you tell me to calm down?
-- you don't understand: it's more pain than before and the fucking morphine pills aren't working, he's -- past two days it's like he can't really swallow them and I don't know if they're going down -- I can't see inside his mouth anymore -- I'm up all night staring at him and I don't think the pills are going down and he moans and he hurts --
How's today then?
Get a girlfriend.
And do good things with her...share the thing...all that bullshit is true, y'know...find someone and hold on all that...Where's Linda?
...ah...maybe...yeah...she's a good one...
Jack.
Hello?
I think you have the wrong number.
-- see, I thought you grew up here in the valley --
-- just to clarify --
Do you remember a Miss Simms?
She does.  From when you were a boy.
Yeah.
the valley?
What does she say about, "Seduce and Destroy."
I wouldn'tve asked --
Do you have your masters?
Are you asking me a question?
Hello.  Frank.  Frank TJ Mackey.
Yeah. I was trying to get in touch with you.  We got dissconnected.
Is he in pain?
When did he go off chemo?
You're just come in --
There's no disturbance.
What does it look like?
I live alone.
I preffer to stand.
I said: I DON'T KNOW.  You can't just come in here and start pokin' around --
Will you say my name?
I'm sorry.
I can't fuckin' do this.
We are not on display.  I am not a doll. I AM NOT A DOLL...I' M NOT SILLY AND CUTE. I'M SMART SO THAT SHOULDN'T MAKE ME SOMETHING, SOMETHING SO PEOPLE CAN WATCH HOW SILLY IT IS THAT HE'S SMART?  I KNOW.  I KNOW THINGS. I KNOW. I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM AND I HAVE TO GO.
Come home soon after the show.
-- did she talk to you?
Did you tell her?
hey.
It's over.  I talked to her this morning.
What? No, Rose, jesus, no --
I don't.
I don't know....
I love you so much.
But you can't say....
You deserve to die alone for what you've done.
She's asleep.
Commercials, a sitcom, an MOW or something.
They look pretty smart, I think.
Not exactly, Linda. I'm not sure where you're going with this --
Linda, you're safe.  Ok. It's alright. You're my friend.  You and Earl are my clients and what you need to talk about won't leave this room, you have something you have to say --
You can't change his will.  Only Earl can change his will.
I can't.
Where will the money go?
-- that can't happen.  Earl doesn't want him to have the money, the things.
Let me call you a car, Linda.
You motherfucker...you motherfucker.... YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE, WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU? WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?
Pink Dot.
Yeah.
Total is $15.29.  Thirty minutes or less.
They just let me have my own study-time, my own reading time in the library.
I got an audition, I won't make it here 'till two, c'mon, I'll see you later. Love you.
Go to it, handsome.
What's the problem, what's the problem here?
Are we gonna keep going with this game?
You have to be nicer to me, Dad.
..sorry...
...what...?
...fuck you mean, it's raining frogs?
....what the fuck, what the fuck....
M'lady...?
M'lady... if anyone sees, it is death...
He is dead!  By God's choice!  There is nothing to discuss.
How can I serve you in this?
Porthos sleeps, and you plot.  Don't you think it's time you told me what it is you are plotting?
The Prison of Belle Sur.
Then you are a fool -- a fool who has never lost a son.  What gives you the right to judge me, to play God with the lives of others?  Is it because you are so much holier than everyone else?!
Now.  You were saying?
Hang himself?!
Poor Phillippe!
But Aramis -- !  Phillippe can learn in time, but --
Remember, Phillippe... nobility is born in the heart.
No!  Stop --
I cannot betray Louis.  I will defend him with my life.
D'Artagnan... Those are young Musketeers down there.  They have been weaned on our legends.  They revere us -- it is an advantage. Why don't we charge them?
Aramis... is this the way to hell?
Where are we?
But -- doesn't God ordain both Pope and King?
And why are you so glum?
Athos, do you understand this?  He confuses me --
We go someplace dangerous.
D'Artagnan watches everything.  We have to be lucky.
Do I look all right?
Mother's ring.  I can't take this.
It's been too long.
You knew this was happening.  You knew and that's why you came.
Raoul is hurrying to the front, so I must hurry too.
Athos, please...!
Recent hours have been a shock.
The room of the King's favorite mistress?
One for all.  All for one.
The plans for use of the maze were not disclosed to me.
Then you must allow me to stay close to you so that --
You dare criticize my father?!  Or lecture me?!
Your Majesty.  This ball, with an open invitation to the nobility of Paris -- we have no way of checking --
I want all these passages sealed! Another stupid idea of my father's! Seal them all, every one!
Even the bedchamber passages!  Let none remain!
Where is Michelle?
Continue.
You dead yet?
Did they kill him?
Do you want Athos arrested, your Majesty?
Now.  Where is d'Artagnan?
The food doesn't please you?
Alright, we know who we're looking for.  Play it cool until the time is right to make a move.  Let's not pull any gangbusters shit or we'll lose him again.
Yeah?
Find out for me.
Something wrong with you Marvosa?
Alright, where is she?
Yeah...the guy was psycho - I was just tying to protect the girl...
Did you read today's paper?
Mind if I turn out the light?
Why did you set me up?
Look what are you anyway? Some kind of spy?
I didn't know what to do - but I knew I had something somebody would want.  That's where I met him - told him what I had.  The FBI set me up with a new place...but the cops found me somehow.  So I ran...and met you.
No...
Jimmy, do you realize what you did? Man that's like death penalty shit -
No - that's not it!  She said her boyfriend stranded her up there! I didn't ask her to come with me!
What?
Long gone, huh?
It was you who did the asking.
He's an eideteker. He has almost total recall.  But I don't think he's psychic.  What he has it empathy and projection.  He can assume your point of view and mine.., and some other points of view that scare and sicken him.
I'll tell you the events. The psychology's none of your business. Hobbs was trying to cut his eleven- year-old daughter's throat. Graham shot him with his .38 six times. Hobbs still didn't go down. He had to wade in...
No. It happened when Graham went to see Hobbs' daughter four months later in the hospital. She saved her carotid artery.., but lost three fingers and her larynx. She was connected up to a voice box.  When Graham went to see her, she asked him -- through the speaker: 'Why did you have to kill my daddy?'  That's when Graham had his nervous breakdown.
Crawford has a proposition. I don't think it's a good idea.
Then the Tooth Fairy named the book in the part Lecktor tore out.
'Dear Pilgrim, you honor me.'
He thinks you want him to look at evidence.
I should have caught you at the boat yard when you got off work. You don't want to talk about it here...
That's not entirely true, Will. It's the way you think.
If you can't look anymore, I understand...
Jack, this is Graham. Is Price still in Latent Prints?
He is good. Bur not as good as Price.
...snuck in the hospital while I was sedated, flipped back the sheets and shot pictures. The only decent thing he did was run a black square over my balls...
For Christ's sake, why?
Is it weird?
What'd it say?
From the lip wound, which happened seven hours before he got burned, we've narrowed it down to those cities within the seven-hour driving radius that also would've caught the 'Tattler' early Tuesday morning.
When are you coming back?
He changes them into beings that accept him... And he needs to see the acceptance, In the mirrors.  I didn't understand the mirrors before.  It's very important.
It's a word. Killing them...  His delusion is: if he sees himself accepted enough times, he will become as one who has the power to be accepted all the time.  And he would record it somehow. So he can see himself received over and over again...
It does, doesn't it?
Ms. McClain, I'm Francis Dollarhyde. I came about the low light level infrared film stock.
I'll take you.
My sister's coming by to pick me up for brunch. Why don't you come, too?
Do you want a Coke or something, Reba?
Who?
Two groups of people were changed. Leeds and Jacobi. The police think they were murdered.  Do you know what they call the being that visited these people?  You can say.
What am I doing here?
Do you pray to God, Mr. Lounds?
Open your eyes, Mr. Lounds.
Freddie Lounds. Your photograph. Do you see?
Are you a man?
Now you will read this into the tape recorder.
Come in.
She doesn't have a Rolodex.
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Tenth and Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C.
This is Will Graham. Can I help you?
He's very strong physically.
He may have a history of biting -- barroom fights or child abuse.
What did the psychologists say was wrong with Lecktor?
To yourself...
I said you are fine, he should leave you the hell alone.
Molly?
Will you be in Atlanta for a while? I'm not buggin' you about coming home, I just wondered.
I'm thinking about painting the kitchen. What color do you like, Will? Are you there?
Blue is cold.
You remember when we first met?  And were together alone in that room. And the exhilaration was too much to hold on to. And then something flickered across your face like a shadow and I asked you what was wrong?
Can you quit?
Yes. Is Molly there?
I know... 'Out in the good air...'
Thanks for the lift.
That's right.
Lt. Fisk said...
What do you want?
It's a precaution...  Why don't you run down to the bay. They got a swimming float.
Is there anything I need to know to see about Mom?
And Hobbs died?
Did you get my card?
And?
Yes.
Why should I tell you?
Then by implication, you think that you are smarter than me, since you caught me.
Let me have them, and I might consider it.
What were the yards like?
Because, my dear Will, if this Pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the full moon, he might go outside and look at it.  Have you seen blood in moonlight, Will? It appears quite black. If one were nude, it would be better to have outdoor privacy for this sort of thing.
May I keep the file?
No.
You know Lounds's enlightened me on one thing: your confinement in the mental hospital. My attorney should have brought that our in court.
Why does it feel good?
I'm gonna spray your suit jackets. It'll be invisible in this light, but you'll stand out like a zebra for us.  They told me you checked out a .44 Charter Arms Bulldog.
Glaser Safety Slugs?
People love... comedians.
No.
Eh, hi, Andy.  Look, this Tony Clifton... is he performing anywhere?
Andy!
I'm sorry, George...
Hi, George!  Good to hear from you!
Oh dear!  George, this is gonna kill Tony. He's waited his whole life for this break.
Andy, do you realize you don't do comedy anymore?  Where's that sweet guy who used to do  "Here I come to save the day!"?  Please, enough with the wrestling! You've lost touch with reality!
Andy, you're surrounded by what you create.  You are the KING of negative energy.
Did your -- doctor say it's okay for you to go back to work?
So, Mr. Besserman, same slot tomorrow...?
Right...
Excuse me -- ?
What are you talking about?!  We just met an hour ago.
Hi...
Andy, the theater's that way!
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me --
Each show is worse than the next.
I dunno about this...  What will my mother think?
Look at this!  An evil Russian! Ooo, here's an evil Nazi -- he likes to fight dirty!  Hey, here's an evil Japanese guy!
Well, call SAG.  It'd be cool to get one on the show.  I want the evening to build and build.  It's gonna have the most incredible ending: Singers, dancers, the "Hallelujah Chorus" -- then the sky opens, and Santa Claus comes flying down!
Excuse me, Andy...
No, I'm serious.  If you book Tony, do NOT EXPECT TO GET ANDY.
We had a deal!!
Who is this? TONY CLIFTON  You -- you know damn straight who it is.  Tony Clifton!  A name to respect.  A name to fear.  Beer.  Gear.  Deer.  Ear.
Why is he saying these things?!
He's gonna make it.
That's the third white van I've seen.
There's something about him, isn't there?
I don't believe it!  I don't believe it!
Why you're here?
I'm going to let you in on a little secret here.  Now don't tell him I told you this, but this ain't the first time Morpheus thought he found the One.
You bet your ass.  It keeps him going.  Maybe it keeps all of us going.
There was an accident.  A fucking car accident.  All of a sudden. Boom.  Jesus, someone's going to make a believer out of me.
You can't use that until Neo is out!
Morpheus...
How?!
Good.  Now there is a window.  Open it.
Why not?
... am I dead?
We have only bits and pieces of information.  What we know for certain is that, at some point in the early Twenty-first Century, all of mankind was united in celebration.  Through the blinding inebriation of hubris, we marveled at our magnificence as we gave birth to A.I.
If you are killed in the Matrix, you die here?
What?  Are you trying to tell me that I can dodge bullets?
So is this the same oracle that made the, uh, prophecy?
What did she tell you?
What do I believe it?  Are you kidding me?  What do you think?  I'm still trying to deal with the fact that everything I believed was real, wasn't.  The whole world, my entire life was a lie.  I don't know anything anymore, Morpheus.
Why?  So I can hear some old lady tell me, what?  That I'm this guy that everybody's been waiting for? The one that's supposed to save the world?  Come on.  How do I respond to that?  I can't.  It's ridiculous. I mean who am I?  I'm nobody, I'm just a guy.  What did I do, Morpheus?  Why me?
Listen to me, Neo.  I know why you're afraid to go through that door.  You can't get free of thinking that I could be wrong.  You must believe me.  There is a greatness inside of you, Neo.  A greatness that is going to lift you to unimaginable heights and that in time will change the world.
How is he?
Got it.
Tank.
I said don't worry about it.  I'll get one of my kids to fix it.
So?  What do you think?  You think you're the One?
Sorry, kid.  You got the gift but looks like you're waiting for something.
Morpheus believes in you, Neo and no one, not you or even me can convince him otherwise.  He believes it so blindly that he's going to sacrifice his life to save yours.
What the hell is this?!
From what?
Neo, please, you have to trust me.
Get this thing out of me!
E.M.P.  An electromagnetic pulse.
How much like it?  Was it the same cat?
What?
No, you... have to be.
No, Neo.  That's not true.  It can't be true.
Neo, how did you do that?
Where is it?
See who?
Goddamnit!  I don't believe this is happening!
Okay.  Store's open.  What do you need?  Besides a miracle...
An Agent!  You have to send me back!
What just happened?
No, really, I liked it...thought it was great.
Whether she wants to or not...she's not going.
We went down to Chinatown but they don't have any.
Sssh!  Quiet.  Y'know that's illegal.
Yeah.
Yeah.
See what I mean?  A question please...'Is this what you call living?'
No.
Hey...no more good times like before.  Until you come back.
Waddaya think?
What happened to you Flash?
You'd better make a move kid.  He thinks you're trying to screw him.
I'll tell you what I don't do... I don't owe anybody 2,000 clams plus interest, stupid.  Show up or I break both your arms, we understand each other?
I won't wait until Tuesday.  I'll break your arms right now.
Hey...don't do that...I'm only scaring them.
Let's get out of here.
That's what I get for getting involved.  Look, on pay-day at least show up at Tony's Place to meet him, ok?  This way he doesn't think that you're trying to screw him.  If you show good faith and save his face maybe we can talk and he'll take off the interest or make different payment arrangements or something... understand?  I'm not asking I'm telling you!!
Keep your mouth shut.
Oh, cut it out, will ya?
Don't ask...do you have any idea what I've been doing all morning...eh?
I was in the basement fixing the pipes.  Would you believe that?
Oh great...hey - Winstons?
Nope...
Hey, shut up.
Charlie, this is business.
I'll tell you who you can pray for... Next payday, I'll be at Tony's Place...Johnny better show or I find him and break his legs...and I mean it.
No, I'm serious...You're really good.
About Oscar...I think he put on this act...about the restaurant being in bad shape and all that. He can't make the payments...I don't know what to make of it.  He says Groppi's run off with a girl. I could help if you want.
Take a drink!
Oh yes, he's pretty good.
His whole family has problems...his cousin, the girl who lives next door to you...
I'd like to eat something before I go back to work.
See if you can get your hands on some pamphlets on laws or by laws...or proprietorship...you know...at your place.
Take your time.  I don't care.
That W.A.S.P. bastard.
I'm going to take that apartment uptown.
I can take care of myself.  You know that.
and a double for you and Charlie here.  And put it on my tab, willya?
Will you guys shut up with the witches and tigers.  Tony, you gonna close the place, we get out of here, get something to eat, or what?
Must have been all the liquor in him.
That's your name?
Did you speak to the Governor?
His wife?
Daddy!
Fireworks.  Update -- we're con- structing the number '65' on the barge, archers from the State College at New Paltz will shoot flaming arrows at it, when it catches fire it will give us the effect of a Viking funeral with none of the morbidity... The Hudson River Authority says, for you, they'll make a special dispensation - of course there'll be an overtime bill for the Poughkeepsie Fire Dept...
I hate parties --
I know you do, darling.
Now, I'm getting interested.  I want to know more ---
Whatever it was, they'll be here. We sent out invitations to everyone, plane tickets included -- the RSVP's are amazing.  A few of them we didn't hear from, and some of them are dead, of course --
I do it because I love you.  Because everybody I loved you.  Mommy -- wher- ever she is -- Susan, Quince, the people who work for you, everybody who's ever known you.
Please don't be negative, Drew, we have an acceptance list that would do The White House proud -- The Secretary-General of the UN, the Chairman of the FCC, nine Senators, I don't know how many Congressmen, and at least twelve of the Fortune '500'.
Paillarde of veal.
Yeah, but --
Left field somewhere.  Well, Bill, I want to come in from the outfield, bat cleanup like you have, learn the plush ropes --
Yes, sir?
Well... goodnight.
And what would that be?
Incidentally, Joe, where're you staying?
Anything else, Mr. Black?  How about some water?
Yes.
Is this a state secret or are we being excluded just for the fun of it?
No, I don't --
So tell me, tell me, I'm peeing in my pants.
'Thoughts'?  Not a one -- but I did hear a voice last night.
...Sounds like you're not leaving much room for discussion.
You're not familiar with the phrase, "In this world, nothing is certain but Death and Taxes"?
Shall we adjourn?
Yes, you are to understand that, and now may I ask you a question?
Hey, this is it, the hour approach- es, I'm getting all excited.  So what do you think, is it --  -- just the 'Executive Committee' or could you guys use me?
Never mind Bontecou.  I've got some other merger possibilities up my sleeve, and I'm putting them to see old man.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's what he said.
I'd like to come, too.  See Susan strut her stuff.
I nuttin' to do wi' dat.
Not time yet.
Oh, you come to see Doctor Lady?
I am.
Brung you flowers and all I gettin's facety back.
Good morning, Mr. Parrish.
Cirrhosis of the liver is the fifth leading killer of adult Western males.
Do you think I should wait to tell him 'till after the party?
What are you doing here?
What are your intentions?  To make little dreams in coffee shops, turn a woman's head, and I don't mind admitting it was turned, I liked it, but ten hours later I feel like a fool.  I don't get it.  You, my father, here in this house, the cof- fee shop, it's making me upset, and I don't like being upset.  Who are you anyway?  And what are you eating?
Whatever you do.
And I'll be a visitor.
I have to go, I'm sorry to say --
I wanted to apologize, Susan --
Well, now I am sorry.  For intruding on you this afternoon.
Has her pain abated?
Almost.
You're here?
...No.
Did you like making love to me?
More than you love peanut butter?
I - uh --
No --
Shook me up.  I mean that you knew her and everything --
When you go, I go.
No --
Well, thank you for letting me know.
When you were shaving this morning, you weren't just shaving, right?
So you understand the concept then. When you're busy here, your work, what your task is, is being executed elsewhere.
How about giving a guy a break?
-- I don't deserve this.  I'm still young, this is not my time --
Now I'd like to be alone.
About Susan?
How about you telling me?  When I ask a simple question, I expect a straight answer.  That's what I'm used to.  Anybody who doesn't give it to me, I fire.
With all due respect, Bill, I'm not asking your permission.
-- I have the feeling that, all in all, what I made this voyage for -- has served its purpose.
Then what is it?
I don't like what you're saying.
He is --
An offense --
Am I dreaming this?  Are you a dream?
That's me.
Where are you?
What is this, a joke, right?  Some kind of elaborate practical joke? At my 40th reunion, we delivered a casket to the Class president's hotel room and --
Get what?
What the hell are you talking about?
What question?
The 'question' --
How're you doing--?
No, anything is possible.  It's up to Joe.
...It's not over, 'til it's over.
Eddie, hold out all the hope you want but, I promise you, it's hope- less, it's over.  Come on up, let's get drunk, if I had your shoulder to lean on I might actually enjoy this --
...There's a start for a meeting.
Susan, you're a hell of a woman. You've got a great career, you're beautiful --
I know it's a cornball thing but love is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without.  If you don't start with that, what are you going to end up with?  I say fall head over heels.  Find someone you can love like crazy and who'll love you the same way back.  And how do you find him?  Forget your head and listen to your heart.  I'm not hearing any heart.  Run the risk, if you get hurt, you'll come back.  Because, the truth is there is no sense living your life without this.  To make the journey and not fall deeply in love -- well, you haven't lived a life at all. You have to try.  Because if you haven't tried, you haven't lived.
Well, go get 'em, Pops.
I don't think this is the lightning you are looking for.  Drew's a good man.  I know I didn't seem to be completely in his corner before, but I've come to appreciate --
Susan, I don't think Joe is going to be with us long.
What a night.
What was that?
Oh yeah?  What was 'fascinating' about it?
I'm not trying to sharpshoot you, but that 'nothing lasts' stuff, that's what was the trouble with Honey's guy.  He was fooling around and Honey caught him at it.  One girlfriend wasn't enough for him.
So if I needed a doctor, you could be it?
I've got patients coming in --
...It's kind of a pro bono job.
You'll have a hard time finding a woman like that these days --
I've got to go --
Why?
You said you liked me.
39.
66.
Should I wear it?
What can I do for you, Leonard?
Amnesia?
How long have I been here?
Shit. Wrong room.
Leonard, it's Burt from the front desk.
What?
I haven't made a strong enough impression.
I wasn't helping you for money.
You decided to help me. Trust yourself. Trust your own judgment. You can question everything, you can never know anything for sure.
He didn't believe me. He said that if I don't get him the money tomorrow he's gonna kill me. Then he started hitting me.
Give him some bruises of his own and tell him to look for a guy called Teddy.
Me? Why would he be interested in me?
How?
Don't talk about my wife.
Just take it easy, this isn't my fault.
How did they explain what you remembered? The gun and stuff?
My boyfriend told me about you.
Chronic alcoholism ~ one cause of short term memory loss.
I don't know. I'm sorry.
Shut your mouth!
Yup?
It's my condition. I never know if I've already eaten, so I always just eat small amounts.
Why?
You really want to find this guy?
Natalie? Natalie who?
We can't just walk him out tied up and bleeding.
It must be his. I don't think they'd let someone like me carry a gun.
Fuck you. We shoulda taken his car.
What do you mean "bad news"?
She couldn't.
My wife's death. I used to work in Insurance, we were well covered.
I didn't sell -
This is a drug deal?!
I was wrong! That's the whole point! Sammy's wife came to me and -
She wasn't diabetic. You think I don't			 * know my own wife? What the fuck is wrong		    * with you?							*
Okay. We clean him up, untie him and			   * march him out with a gun in his back.			  *
No.  I was in Namibia...
Yeah.
Quarter mile away.  We see the lights...
We know these people...!
He is fine.  And we know the jokes. When it gets vengeful, things get messy.  When they get messy the wrong people die...  Everybody gets it.
Okay.  What'd you spot...?
We're not certain...
Not anymore.  This is a distribution network out of South Florida, moving poly-drug loads, crystal meth through coke, to Nashville, Atlanta, Memphis, Cleveland.  And computer fraud, identity theft. It's like that.
So...?
We want it back.
There is one thing you can do for me in recognition of the death- defying risks we took to recover your product...
Mojitas...?
Blanca...a rubio like you.  I see her in a dress...an old photograph from Lucinda somebody's wedding...everybody is with couples.  Husbands and wives.  They all pose.  My mother is alone because my father had to go back to the fighting.  ...she looks right into the camera. She is the most beautiful woman in the room.  By herself.  In a party dress.  And she looked like she knew she would die alone...  She spoke many languages.  We were in Luanda when she died.  I went to her friends in Mali.  They sent me to the Ecole Polytechnique in Geneva to study mathematics, where I met Montoya in the discos.  He had banking there...I was seventeen and very much into the clubs.  And he sent me to University for an MBA in Finance.  Your mother?
...'cause we have no future...are of today and not tomorrow.
'Cause you don't lose loads?
The range should be between fifteen and seventeen-point-five percent of the P.O.E....to even consider it.
Do you have assets somewhere else? Bank accounts?
...to fall back on.  You know, a fail-safe.  Insurance.
Sure.  As far away and as fast as you can.
Yero, by himself?
So?
Anything?
No.  You gonna give me phony reassurances?
Where?
Verdado where?
Havana, Cuba...?
What is going on...?!
Detective Crockett.
That's right.
Who said, "go exploring"?  We want this staying on track.
Out of...?
Control your men.
Yeah...?
Reverse undercover?  WE supply to them?
What flowers?
They've been targeted.  And Pakistani registry is too vulnerable to search and seizure right now.
And...?
Then what were we talking to you for?
I walk into Neptune's house...very nice.  But I also see you... and our drugs that got ripped from Maguda.
They said they wouldn't hurt them, wouldn't hurt them if...
Yeah?
He's got taxi fare.
Okay. Never argue with a man.
... you see what I'm getting at here? She got a penthouse up there with color TV and more goddam diamonds than an archbishop and she busts out bawling when I ask for money!
I think you just put your finger on it, I do.
What's in your socks?
Joe -- do me one favor -- this is my place, am I wrong? You know, in my own place my name ain't Ratso. I mean it so happens my name is Enrico Salvatore Rizzo.
Rico then, at least call me Rico in my own goddam place.
Miami Beach is the only place for a real hustler. Florida has more rich chicks per square yard than any resort spot in the world. They lie out in their pagodas and pergolas waiting to grab the first jockstrap that passes.
Look at yourself, Joe, no offense, but frankly, you're beginning to smell. For a stud in this town that's a handicap.
You ain't got a chance in hell. You need threads and glitter, baby. A front, hey?
Kee-rist, you pretty damn clever for a skimpy little gimp.
Not bad -- for a cowboy -- you're okay, you're okay.
Where'd that come from?
Well, this thought just struck me. It wasn't too long ago I was washing dishes way the hell somewhere in Texas.
Well, I made it. This here is Ratso Rizzo and I...
They wrong?
Well, I don't think I can walk.  I mean, I been falling down a lot and, uh...
If you have to shiver, why don't you pull the blanket up more?
Sometimes it seems to me time stopped twenty years ago. There was this war, there was this handsome young man with quite black hair and he was supposed to die. But he didn't. Isn't that amusing?
You want me to leave?
Ready for hard work, son?
You really want to do business?
He fell. Hey, fella, you fell. Is he all right?
'Figgers.
Years?
Anybody bitten?
Hey, you know what's gonna get us out of here?  It's not a map, Max. It's our balls. You know what I mean...  ...I gotta get laid man, I don't know 'bout you guys, but if I don't get it on soon, I'm... I'm not gonna make it.
Right!  That's what we're shooting for.  Mister Davis and have been in contact with the State Department, but right now relations with the Turks aren't too good, Nixon's upset the hell out of them. Our best bet's... right here.
Where'd you get that limp?
How do you like it?  Istanbul?
Why'd you do it, Billy?
I know you kids smoke that stuff, and we drink booze, but taking it across a border - it was stupid, Billy. Stupid.
Yes...?
...are you with the Consulate?
Jeez, she used to say I was the lucky one.
New people sometimes get on his nerves.
What they give you?
How much did you have?
There is no fair in Turkey, Billy. It's all "sula-bula" like this, like that. An Italian hippie had a car accident and a Turk was killed. SO, they threw him in here for six months...
No... It looks like your going to have a new court.
You got your stuff?
Shit!  Shit!  Shit!
Goddamn Gastro's killing me.  Making me blind. Hey Billy!
...His money - steal that, you steal his blood... Could you see his face when everything he worked so hard to get got snatched?  If we knew where he hid it.  Anyway, steal from him they'd pick up the whole prison and shake it sideways.  We couldn't hide it anywhere.
What is it with you man, what the hell is it?
What'd the Prosecutor say?
His name?
Jeremy...
The blintzes!  "Try the blintzes..."
Not just any carbohydrates, mind you. It was like being on the receiving end of some kind of transcendent oral sex.  We should get a strobe on this thing. Maybe even a siren.
You all watch your step.  We got some burrows goin' down seven stories here.  You fall, I don't wanna have to come pick you up.
And a right.
Look, I showed you my badge...
For Chrissakes.  You gonna lay a two- bit bureaucratic, territorial number on me?
For Chrissakes, what's the problem? You need a memo every time you fart?
You feel anything?
What do you-?
Mantids can mimic. We gave the Judas that code...
I didn't protect him, lady. He trusted me. And I didn't protect him... His father...I lost his father to the streets and now, Chuy...
A shame.  You looked great tonight.
We did no impact evaluation.  The consequences of...
You know where they get this fertility stuff?  They extract it from the urine of menopausal Italian nuns.
Evolution doesn't work that fast. Something pushed that thing to take the leap. We need to find another specimen.
Honey, just leave it.
Ironic, don't you think?  These guys can hatch hundreds of offspring in a single clutch of eggs, right? And here we are...
Susan, listen to me:  you handled that insect almost as much as Siri...
So, you're saying this is like those bugs that -- that look like twigs or leaves or...
Rub it on the windows!
No...
Hello.
Not a big one.  I mean, it was like a turkey baster.
It bit you.
My God.
That's impossible.  Insects don't...
Excuse me, that's not exactly the kind of information I was after. You see, he's been missing for quite some time now, and...
Shhh... we're just outside Silver Creek.
You want to read it?
What's your new book called?
But what?
No, what is it?
I can take it, go ahead.
The profanity bothers you?
The one to town is, but that's about it. I called the hospital and talked to the head orthopedic surgeon. I told him who you were and what had happened. He said as long as there's no infection, you're not in any danger, and as soon as the road to the hospital is open, they'll send an ambulance for you.
I DON'T WANT HER SPIRIT! I want HER! And you MURDERED her!
But this time I thought clearly. I asked God about you and God said "I delivered him unto you so that you may show him the way."
I know this is the only copy, Paul. When you were twenty-four you wrote your first book and you didn't make a copy, because you didn't think anybody would take it seriously. But they did. And ever since you've never made any copies because you're superstitious--it's why you always come back to the Silver Creek Lodge. You told that story to Merv Griffin eleven years ago.
Oh, Paul. This isn't about money. It's about decency and purity. It's about God's values.
Yeah, well, it's a theory. Here's your Novril.  How does tuna casserole sound for dinner?
Set what up?
You--fooler...!  Did I do good?
Thank you for thinking of me.  Anything else I can get while I'm in town? Any other crucial requirements that need satisfying? Would you like a tiny tape recorder? Or maybe a handmade set of writing slippers?
Are you sure? 'Cause if you want, I'll bring back the whole store for you.
It'll only take a second.
That's right--when I was growing up in Bakersfield, my favorite thing in all the world was to go to the movies on Saturday afternoons for the chapter plays...
To Misery.
Paul, I know you've been out.
It WAS Windthorne. I knew it--what does that do to her love for Ian?--  --of course, if she hadn't thought Windthorne was murdered she never would have fallen in love with Ian in the first place.  Sorry, it's just that this is so wonderful.
Paul, this will be our legacy.
Oh, Paul. I'm dying. Does she wind up with Ian or Windthorne? You have to tell me.
Stop--stop right here.
You don't think he's dead, do you?
Hey, Jim, what's doing? Uh-huh... uh- huh... Jim, we've been over this. If you're gonna have benches in front of your store, people are gonna sit on them. I don't like him either, but I'm not going to come over there and tell him to move. Give my best to Denise. Bye.
Nothing unusual about Mr. Sheldon's leaving, Buster--you can tell by the champagne.
No, see, he always ordered a bottle of Dom Perignon when he was ready to go. Then he'd pay up and be out the door.
You wouldn't happen to remember if Miz Wilkes bought one, would you?
Newspapers?
An old friend. I was rummaging through a closet and it was just sitting there. Like it was waiting for me.
I haven't been a writer since I got into the Misery business--
I thought you'd be thrilled. You're being taken seriously.
I like it. Remember how you once said I live my whole life as if I'm in danger of being found out? Well, I believe I've managed to get that guy down on paper.  Don't think I'm completely nuts, but in some way, Annie Wilkes, that whole experience, helped me.
- pull the NO2 tank and dump it, it's potential evidence..
Where is it?
On what.
Won't do, love.  It's not spring.  It's nearly autumn..You're in Oz.  everything's upside down and backwards here.
I don't know what to do about you, Sean. I'm more than a bit muddled.  I need time.
Sort it all out.
Bellerophen?  No time at all once I've got it.
Fight a bit of a cold..
Damn.  Just when it was about to get interesting.
Ambrose is meeting some bloke in the bar. Big bloke, ginger hair. They're into something.
Wrong.  All we've got to worry about is Ambrose.  Nyah will take care of Nyah.
Ambrose obviously got these from Nekhorvich on the plane.
Range is two kay.
No.  You just looked as if you did.
Look, it's either you or the rent and I don't mind telling you it's not an easy choice.
May I say something, no offence?  You look like a gigolo, you sound like a thief, you act like a cop - what the bloody hell do you have in mind?
Sounds smashing.  I'm in.  Muchacho, mi carro, por favor!  Now be serious.  You couldn't possibly want me off tonight's performance..
Ask a question, you get an answer!..
There's nearly 2 million in London.
Go and insinuate yourself back into Sean's life.
No.  You can be a thief and have a conscience:  Not me.  Why did you have to tell me about this!  What do I have to do to get away from this guy?  When you're with him, he messes about with your head every waking moment..even now I'll be at some out-of- the-way-place, a tin of caviar and a bottle of Crystal shows up at the table, with two glass, God knows how he finds out at any given moment where I am in the world but he does.  And it looks like he's done it again.  You know his definition of a  true paranoid?
Someone in possession of all the facts.  Are you telling me I have to do this?
Where do I meet you?
Are you okay?
Well.  You're sorry and I'm sorry.
Like it's a good idea to pick him up in a hurry.  And a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier.  So let's get on with it.  He's still in Sydney?
When I couldn't find you, I had to replace you.  Sean Ambrose was the obvious choice. He double you, what?  Two, three times?
What did you think of him?
Sean feels he hasn't done the job unless he leaves a lot of hats on the ground.
Right now only Ambrose knows that.
'Terrorists?'
I don't think I can get her to do it.
Not yet.  We did manage to pull any sensitive equipment and material out of our safehouse wreckage.
Yes, I believe that's right.
Not sure.  Some sort of vacation.  I'll let you know where I'm going.
He was quite a man.  Did he know before the end you two had succeeded?
..not in time to save him.
Luther..get us everything you can on the outbreak of influenza on Bruny Island last month, including photos of the victims.
Ambrose just pulled the memory card out of the digital camera and put it into an envelope, put it in his inner left jacket pocket...
Let's start from the inside out.
Thirty-second opening in the roof and a 250-foot drop.
You asked for my help.  You <u>asked</u> for <u>my</u> help...come on...
You and I know about this -- and that's where it stops.  Understand?  It never happened.
Only four more cars.
Whatís Hunt doing on the TGV?
Nothing but civilians, Gene.
I want to sleep.  Can I sleep here.
Are <u>you</u> all right Ethan.  What's wrong with you?
Sarah's reconsidering.  Claire, transport in five minutes.
Shut up!  I saw you.  You were in the car.
Where were you?
That was four hours ago!  Who sent you? Did they send you here?
Did they send you...Did they send you?
Why haven't they brought us in yet?
The message is for Job.
<u>Are you intact</u>?
Youíre in Prague?
I can't tell you how sorry I am.  I know how much Jim in particular meant to you, Ethan.  Personally as well as professionally.
Passport, visas - you know the drill. We'll work the exfiltration thru Canada, debrief you at Langley.  Throw the Prague police a bone, you know toss them a few suspects.  Follow me?
Yes.  I see your point.
What?
Correct the actual list is safe at Langley.  "Golitsyn" was a lightning rod, one of ours.
What kind?
And I get to keep the equipment when we're done.
He was a good guy for a long, long time. Just - not long enough.  Gotta catch my flight.. So.  How's it feel being a solid citizen again?
The penny drops.  <u>You</u> are <u>not</u> Job.  Yes, Job is not given to quoting Scripture in his communications. And there was its tone -- aggressive but playful.  Job is not playful.  So you're something of a paradox.
I don't know Job any more than he knows me.
Why should I?
It's easy to say the disk is worthless when you say I can't look at the information and <u>see</u> if it's worthless. Not a tenable position, sir.
Mm - Hmmm...
Very good.
Thanks, Max.  Or is it Maxine?
The possibility alone is worth ten million.  Baggage car, rack 3.  Silver briefcase.  Combination 314.
You're not going to any meeting without me.
Sorry, am I interrupting?
OK.  Taking Golitsyn's exit.  Jack, open the doors.
Would you remove your hat please?
Then what am I doing here?
Forty-four.  Forty-five.
How was Chicago?
You're going to use Walter?
Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing?
He won't be back in a hurry?
Jack's pinned down Sarah.  Should be a second.  Keep dancing.
Tight security.  No guns.  Real plus.
Sorry Ethan.  Times up.  Say goodbye.
Look to your right, then back to me. There's a camera built right into the bridge.  Whatever you see it sees and transmits it back here.  Can you hear me?
Is something wrong with the phone?  Well is something wrong with the batteries?
Uh-huh
Okay.
I don't wanna talk about it.
I have my eyes open.
He got hit by a bus.
Mona?
I got it done.
We're supposed to do fifty apples. We only got twelve done.
Yeah, this is Ronny.
Why didn't he call himself?
You are going to marry my brother?
I have no life. My brother Johnny took my life from me.
Gimme the big knife! I'm gonna cut my throat!
It's wood. It's fake. Five years ago I was engaged to be married. Johnny came in here, he ordered bread from me. I put it in the slicer and I talked with him and my hand got caught cause I wasn't paying attention. The slicer chewed off my hand. It's funny 'cause - when my fiancé saw that I was maimed, she left me for another man.
I don't know.
How many men since then?
Why you talking to me?
I can't believe what is happening.
Your blood.
It's so bright.
I'm marrying your brother!
Snap out of it!
What?
Kinda gaudy.
I'm here!
I'm afraid of who I am.
What's the matter? You look crazy.
Hi Loretta.
You don't want the fish.
It's the oily fish tonight. Not before the plane ride.
A man who can't control his woman is funny.
Will you marry me?
Must it be so definite? Can't we just say that we will be married when I get back?
Yeah.
He's my younger brother.
We haven't spoken in five years. There was some bad blood. I want you to call him and invite him to the wedding. Will you do it?
I have no secrets from my family.
WHAT?
No.
What's thirty-seven? I had Chiro after I was thirty-seven. It ain't over till it's over.
And we'll sell the house.
I don't wanna talk about it.
What! How do you know?
No. But I have a hangover.
Hi.
What about the moon?
Listen, I gotta go. I'll take the deposit to the bank but I'll do the books tomorrow. I gotta go.
Hi, Loretta.
We just come from the bank.
I know.
I know.
Lucy. There are big things going on in my house. My granddaughter Loretta, the only daughter of my son Cosmo, has engaged herself to be married a second time.
He owes her a wedding from the first time when there was none.
Maybe I should go?
No idea.
Because my mother was dying! But now she's not.
When I was twenty-seven years old, in Jersey City, I asked a woman to marry me. She had red hair. She smelled a jasmine. She wore black shoes with pointy white tips.
I'm sorry if we disturbed you.
I'm a professor. I teach communications at N.Y.U.
Maybe. Listen. You wanna know why I chase women? I find women charming.
Temperature's dropping.
Look.
A witch,  a witch,  burn her!
Get away!
Found them?  In Mercea.  The coconut's tropical!
It's not a question of where he grips it,  It's a simple matter of weight - ratios ...  A five-ounce bird could not hold a a one pound coconut.
There is much danger ... for beyond the cave lies the Gorge of Eternal Peril which no man has ever crossed.
King of the WHO?
Order, eh -- who does he think he is?
Well, I didn't vote for you.
All right!  All right! ... No more, please.  We will find you a shrubbery ...
We shall do no such thing ... let us pass!
What word?
You're a liar.
I'll do you for that.
I'm invincible!
All right, we'll call it a draw.
Who are they?
Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.
Old woman!
Man.  I'm sorry.  Old man, What knight live in that castle over there?
I mean, if I went around saying I was an Emperor because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, people would put me away!
I'm averting my eyes, Lord.
Nothing... There's your ninepence.
What is your quest?
To seek the Grail!
Don't be such a baby.
You killed eight wedding guests in all!
Do you want to come and have a drink?
But I don't like her.
Hurry, brave Sir Launcelot!
Leaving the room ... yes.
Oh, yes!  we'll keep him in here, obviously.  But if he had to leave and we were with him.
Right.
Make sure he doesn't leave.
No, I want you to stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room until I get back.
The Castle Anthrax?
Well, look er, I ...
Well ...
Well, she's got a point.
Come Sir Galahad, quickly!
Look, it's my duty as a knight to try and sample as much peril as I can.
... I Bet you're gay.
No, no, this cannot be.   I am sworn to chastity!
Oh, fair one, behold your humble servant, Sir Launcelot, from the Court of Camelot.  I have come to take you ...  away ... I'm terribly sorry ...
When you have found the shrubbery, then you must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest ... with a herring.
Stop saying the word!
|      You turd! +      Mangy scots git!
I done it again.
He is brave Sir Robin, brave Sir Robin, who ...
So what did Ponsonby do when she started shouting?
How much?
What?
She'll blow hot and cold on you, John, she always does.  You want to be careful.
Don't be an idiot!  You're in no fit state to go anywhere.
And when was the last time she put herself out for you?  Look, John, whatever she says to you now, in the end you're still a servant.
My lips may give a message better of Christmas love than e'en this letter.  To my best friend, J.B. from his best friend, V.R.  Best friend!
The place is a mess.
Yeah, there's a good girl.  Have you had a look at this hoof?  She was limping badly.  I think there might be a stone in it.
Good man.  And is she all right?
Have you met Mr Lyle?  He's in sugar...?
Convey her a message.
Well, everyone's entitled to their opinion.
If it is inconvenient to Her Majesty, then perhaps she might consider allowing the Prince of Wales to host--
Surely it is for the gentlemen to decide when to stop...
Yes, but isn't midnight a little excessive?
Then we'll have to see what can be arranged.
Do you?
Go inside at once.
What brings you here?
Always remember, you keep it tight to your shoulder, you absorb the kick. Aim for the head.  Then imagine it's Gladstone.
Princes and Lords are but the breath of kings, An honest man's the noblest work of God.  You must miss such magnificent views.
Still, someone must attend you.  Your wife should not have let you out.
To have achieved one's ambition, or to have reconciled oneself to its limits, is a lifetime's work.
Her mind is set.  She won't change now.
No loyalty.
She'll think I betrayed her.
You are here safely.
The Queen will ride out if and when she chooses.
Prince Albert was going to build a bench here.  He thought it one of the best views in Osborne.
I do not do it for others.  But Ponsonby thinks they are good.
Aye, well, if all you want is a good opinion then he'd be sure to oblige you.
They're ready now.
I had foreseen that you would not. But Your Majesty should understand -- that my mind will not be changed in this.  I leave for Deeside --
Then they may read about me.
Is that not enough?
Gossip counts.  Lord Aberdeen was right.  This country is not governed by wisdom but by talk.  Granted, it wouldn't take much to winkle the old girl out of mourning, but if public opinion is against her, then it doesn't do to appear too close.
Mrs Brown.
Erysipelas.
The Queen wishes to publish an account of him.
Well, no rest for the wicked, Henry.
Forgive me, Your Majesty.  In no way did I wish to suggest--
The Royal Family and senior members of the household, ma'am.
He appears to be ... standing by his horse.
Well?
Why?
Unwell?
Read it.
Who told them that?
Why not?
What do they want?
What do you mean?
The donor.  Maybe he's alive inside the game.
Has anyone seen Greg?
I have to talk to you.
It is.
Sorry.  Maybe I need the Valium.
Something's happened to them.
Because I didn't know where else to go.
Then leave her.
That's what I thought.
Maybe it is alive in a way...some sort of electronic intelligence.  It's like a computer virus that developed a personality or something.  It's self-replicating...it mimics life.
It's growing.  Getting stronger. Maybe it's only localized now...
Then where do we go?!
SLIP-STREAM.
You got the schematics?
Alex...
You're not coming, Alex.
I know how to do this!  I'm good at these games.  You never play, you'd be nailed in an instant.
You don't get it, do you?
And we've still got time left.  This was a piece of cake.
Christ...no time...
Go for it.
How did you get here?  Did you play the game?!
Then we'll go home?
Which way?
It's the wrong way!
I love you, Alex.  I never wanted to leave. You know that, don't you?
So start at the beginning...
Adam, where are you?
Home! Meet me at the office. We've got to do something ... you've got to do something Adam!
Beautiful night.
Well now, here's a man who wants to get right to it. Kinda anxious to get to it are ya?
What did I say?
So, what did they say?
Have many famous actors and actresses lived here? I was meaning to ask you that.
Wow!
Oh Coco thank you. Thank you so much.
She wants to know who's staying in her apartment.
You're really something Coco...thank you.
Hi.
Just tell me where it hurts, baby.
Betty.
Was anyone hurt?
Number 17.
The money. You don't know where it came from?
That's where I was going... Mulholland Drive.
What's wrong with that?
I hope I'm back in a couple of hours. Don't drink all the coke.
When I get back I'll have the cab waiting, so be ready to go.
Why didn't you ask him? Sol knows you!
I don't think...
Wally Brown.
What's  the matter now?
It's kind of embarrassing but,
Oh, things aren't so bad. Gee, I hope you're not goin' to get in any trouble.
Not here...no thanks.
So many tubes to get in, only one is the way out.
You must come in first place to move on !
Good morning. What do you have today ?
You said we were criminals, what did you mean ?
Now where do we go ?
Hey ! Hey ! I'm talking to you !
You took an awful big risk back there.
If you hadn't started boffing that weasel with an attitude, you wouldn't be here.
Then you didn't give him any passwords of any kind ?
What's the trick here ?
How long till the room fills ?
So why this ?
Do you have something better to talk about ?
It was there, clear as day. I saw the computer records. Matthew has been fed wiring money to his personal account.  I just knew something was wrong.
There are other things too. They had everyone start taking those psych tests. Did they make you take one ?
I wanted to let his family know....
Just stop it. End it here.
What are you DOING here ?
Yeah a real shame.
Are you Matthew Parker ?
NO. Don't. You'll get a shock from hell if you touch that seat.
Be very, very quiet...
The room has sound sensors. If you wake it up, it breathes fire.
An elevator ?
Don't eat at the console.
Never underestimate a man who cheats on his taxes. His file says he is an avid jogger.
You think I'm that easy, Bitch ?
Excuse me, sir ?
Zach, how old are you, son ?
Do you think the assistant, what's his name...
One moment dear...
Hey, Mr. Executive. Buy you a drink sailor ?
Are you happy with your salary and position ?
So who are these people with the Boss ?
I don't know. Maybe we should watch the tape to be sure.
Ach ! How will you know if they've made it ?
So what's next ? No one's ever made it this far before.
The power went out in half the park.
Come on, I'm serious. Look at Wilma. She's this frail little thing, and Fred, I mean Fred Flintstone is this BIG guy. He has to be hung like a horse, and THAT's why Wilma puts up with his B.S.
I just want to have something that's mine, you know ? It's like living off of their money is fun and all. There are certain materialistic needs that I have that can only be satisfied with that extra little scratch.
Not now, Mom.
Are you okay ?
I'm talking to you asshole !
Sweet Jesus I never dreamed I'd be glad to see Central Park at night.
What now ?
Hey good lookin' ! What'cha got cookin' ?
We start with the top and work our way down. We start with the high salaries and then just let the little people go. No need to make the blue collars go crazy.
People said she looked like me.
Excuse me I asked you a question.
This is California, anything is possible.
THANK YOU.
So charge him with something...who's gonna know?
Yeah, this is Sergeant Tanaka from Holenbeck, I need a current address for a Jeffrey....
Do what?
Ahh, strike, not, not bad at all. No, this talk isn't about sex, it's, well there've been a lot of changes, and I know you're upset about losing your room, but the baby's gotta go somewhere.
Dad I'm kidding, you can have the room.
Dad, when a boy likes you, does he pretend that he doesn't like you? And if he pretends that he doesn't like you how can you tell that he likes you?
There's still a big spot on the floor.
You were just having a fight about me. Wouldn't you like to hear my opinion?
No nuns, got it.
What does that mean?
Bye Dad, I'll miss you.
I'll be back in 137 hours.
Oh, Shell, that's ridiculous, where are my needle nosed pliers?
Reason? What reason?
Are you the Hillary Mitchell who went to school with Maggie Muldovan?
It's okay really, I was just a baby.
His name's Harry Sultenfuss.
What're you saying?
Bye.  She looks a little like me when I was a little girl.
I'm glad you're here.
Oh she's great...she's a little crazy though. Anyway, Hillary said that you had a black Ford truck and this policeman I know got in touch with Motor Vehicles and...he gave me your address and here I am.
I don't know very much about her...I was hoping that you could help me.
Wait...woah...woah...wait a minute...Do you think I'm your father?
That's okay.
My mother can't have any more kids.
What are you staring at?
See you? He can smell you from there.
Likes me? He said I looked like a grasshopper.
That's ridiculous, so, if you really can't stand someone, then you pretend that you're really crazy about them?
Then what did she do?
You're crazy, what was her big achievement? Did she invent gravity?
All right, so when did she have you between all her acting and spying and getting caught?
I guess you have.
This is really very nice of you.
If it's in here at all, it's in the back two rows.
He's writing. Hello?
Vada?
Vada what about you, who have you come up with?
Hey Vada. How's your report coming?
Make that sixty and I'm docking your allowance for two weeks.
My parents had a brief, but intensely fulfilling relationship. She's remained a woman of mystery to this day.
You know eavesdropping is a very unattractive habit.
Getting off please.
I never did understand that story, did someone find the needle or not?
Look, here she is. Margaret Ann Muldovan - Newspaper, Literary magazine, French Club, Drama Club, Debate Club, Girls Basketball and Swim team.  With Maggie's combo of good looks and talent, we're sure to be seeing her name in lights. She was gonna be famous.
I think it's cool.
Boy, you're really into this.
You are weird. Let's just go.
Does it work?
Boyfriend?
...I dropped it.
That's 'cause I was cursed with the Sultenfuss Bear Claws.  My hands fit.
Yeah I guess...sort of.
Oh no, we wouldn't be from the same bloodlines or anything. We'd be like two total strangers who...accidentally had relatives that got married.
No, but sometimes he drives a hearse.
And I'm gonna use the movies when I give my report. Jeffrey says audiences love special effects.
...umm...Listen, I'm sorry...you had to sacrifice your entire vacation.
Wow!
Who cares? Rose, tell him we have an arrangement.
Committed?
Well then that's not exactly dating is it.
Lock the door.
Do you think I should tell my dad about Jeffrey Pommeroy?
Well, I've come this far...the least I can do is knock on the door.
No, you're the best and I don't want you talking to anybody on the plane.
What's with the touching, why was he touching you?
Hi!
Yes, what kind of arrangement? I'd be very interested to know what kind of an arrangement we have.
Ahh, Dr. Helburn, why don't you come in tomorrow-morning at eight o'clock, that's when we open, we'll get you started.
Good morning.
Oh no, I, I...eh...I couldn't.
No, the milk comes when the baby comes.
Oh, I was a very late developer, they used to call me &quot;Shelly Two Backs&quot;. All my friends had real bra's, not like the training ones I had.
Margaret's my middle name, but everybody called her Maggie. Los Angeles, have you ever been there?
Do you know him?
I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
The boss is watching us...
Can't you see it?
Dr. Welty!!!? Dr. Welty??
I can't breathe, I'm suffocating.
It's still available I hope?
Okay Mr. Sultenfuss, you got a deal.
You don't like it?
I just wanted to get past this &quot;old school Marm&quot; image.
Well the other night at dinner...
I don't think so, I think she's confused about death.
Thanks, listen I wanna apologize for the other day downstairs, about Vada, I was a little harsh.
Oh right, right, . Bader Lorenzo Died June 22 1972 Devoted husband to Nicolette. Cherished father of Babritzio and Heidi, In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the holy names society.
Kinda like men.
Ahh, complications during child birth, she died two days after Vada was born.
I'm just picking some things up for the barbecue.
Shelly?
Open your eyes, she's eleven years old! Her only friend in the world is dead.
Daddy guess what I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
Shelly thinks I'd be a good writer.
Well Shelly's coming over, we're gonna go together.
Dad, didn't you say you needed prunes REAL bad?
When??
Do you miss her?
I think every time I see a climbing tree i'll think of Thomas J.
Oh yes, oh that's great.
Harry, I'm serious, trust me Harry this woman's lifting us in, you gotta treat her like every Tom Dick and Harry.
Did you not tell Vada I'm a womanizer huh?
Yes she is, but she's very upset, so she's not seeing anyone.
Sure.
Really? Already? The summer's just begun.
How much does it cost?
Cause she's dying.
Do you like her?
Who's winning?
Ooh, that's a pretty ring you're wearing.
He won't give it to me.
Are you married?
Sure.
Are you going out somewhere?
So how come you're putting lipstick on?
The boys at school don't think I am.
Hey Shelly, like seafood?
Vada? Would you like us to get you another goldfish?
It's okay sweetheart.
Hey look at this!
No, I don't wanna.
But, what if you're afraid to ride horses?
They're not gonna let us in Vada, we're kids.
Run faster they're after us!!
Hi Vada.
California, I'm going to Hollywood to live with the Brady Bunch.
I do, she's real funny.
I have to anyway, my mom will be worried.
Oh, that's probably Thomas J, I don't wanna see him. It's not fair. Nothing happens to boys.
Uh huh.
Close your eyes.
Just do it.
Say something it's too quiet.
You better not either.
Seeya tomorrow.
What?
Is it sad to be an editor, and bask only in reflected insincerity?
No, no, the opposite.  That's my best friend, Michael O'Neal. He sounds desperate to talk.
Blood oath.
You think...
He's adored me for nine goddamn years.
I was devastated.
Zit cream?
I suppose it's too late to start over.
I'm taking my next book to Viking.
I'm excited Sports Illustrated gave him this kind of shot, he's only there a ye...
But nothing ever could, ever did, give me a moment's pause about this marriage...
I just think you're wrong, is all.
But he always says...
So... one almost has to...
He'll see right through it.
Look at all this beautiful food, so lovingly prepared...
I saw the show.
Michael, it's Wednesday night, you can't possibly be getting married on Su...
Best everything, Joe.  But I'm going to dance with you.
Gimme like, eight and nine off the top ten list...
Should I whistle down a cab?
I mean Walter owns the Sox, cable sports... most girls in her spot would be angling to get Daddy to offer you some juicy gig right here in t...
Still.  All's fair in love and w...
Why don't you start being honest for one fucking sec...
You guys are heartless, my bride picked this out.
Well.  There's a lot of memories to choose from...
You've sort of been... y'know, the woman in my life.
I wouldn't know.  I never had that many first thoughts.
Where did we first hear th...
Takes me back.
Or we'll go somewhere.  If you have the time.
You're not saying you actually... you're saying that y...
Actually.  Lower.  I am the fungus that feeds on pond scum.  Lower. The layer of mucous that cruds up the fung...
The kiss.  May be hard.  For you to explain.  Because the only fear she really has, is...
It's not just a gag, huh?
He needs someone incredible, someone really close, who he can trust...
It would only be, maybe, six months? Or three or four? It would mean so much to him...
What a sweet little picture.  Mommy and Daddy aren't losing a daughter, they're gaining a eunuch!
And yet here you are.  All celibate and reclusive.
Maybe it's happy there.
Well, don't lose it. Last time I gave you twenty-five dollars, you lost it.
You lost twenty-five dollars once before that, too, near Christmas time -- I remember that real well now. December 9th, to be exact.
I remember when I just saw you. Skinny Winnifred. Jesus, you were skinny.
We have a Bible study meeting tonight if you'd like to come.
I don't want to listen to her sing -
You have to what?
Am I disturbing you?
I said, I've been real tired.
What did you say your name was?
You going today?
I appreciate your concern, but she has to rest, so you can go on home.
You bet.
Well, it's probably because it would help him.
His Word.
He's going to run for president.
He has that sign with the tree.
Bastard
President?
Howdy.
Listen, we're suppose to sing on TV day after tomorrow. At the park...
He got killed at a turkey shoot.
Business School so I can run Haven's business.
You want me to wait?
Yes, sir. I need a room
My wife and I think so, but we're family. Your family's always good or bad depending on how you look at your family. What do you do, pick or sing?
He is just wonderful.
But not unless Nashville really inspires me.
What's this?
Fungus?
Weather's been awful. All those bombs dropping. It changes our weather. Sure not like the good old days.
I want to get the dog off my bed.
Isn't it unusual for you to be working with a black choir?
Do you like him?
Yes.
Oh?
Wrong.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
Premeditated murder.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Hello. John Triplette.
Wednesday at the park. We've got a lot of names coming in...
What National TV...?
You don't know how pleased he'll be.
We just got a gold record.
Come on.
Why?
You go to school together?
Well -- maybe. Let's see what happens here.
Got me an audition tonight.
No -- That's exercises. My coach says you have to do exercise because the vocal chords are muscle and need to be stretched. Every time you stretch them, the middle part sets stronger. That's the place where I sing.
You sure do it loud.
It's not bad.
Wade -- I've been working toward this audition for years.
Point of fact, weren't Tim's hands registered as lethal weapons?
Thank you. Grace, there is one other thing...
What kind of pies do you have?
Which do you recommend?
Now, when we get out there, you do what we say or it's curtains. If we say move, you move. If we say left, you move left. If we say right, you move right. If we say mole, you dig a hole. Got it?
Mickey!
They've been separated since their incarceration in a couple of penitentiaries---
...one night I was asleep, and a noise wakes me up. I thought, 'Oh shit, somebody's broken in.' I didn't own a gun, so I go into the living room with a fucking umbrella. Okay, it turned out to be nothing. God made the noise. Who knows?
Or what? You'll wound me? I can blow you in half and you know it.
We're about ready to go here. Are you ready?
So, Mickey, tell us what you do for fun.
Of course, I miss Mallory. She's my wife. I haven't seen her in a long time. What a stupid question.
Was an instant of purity worth a lifetime lie? Yeah, it was.
That's only part of it. I mean, it's a big, big, big part. But it's only the chorus, it's not the whole song.
You just said an instant of purity was preferrable to a lifetime lie. I don't understand. What's so pure about forty-eight dead bodies?
Okay...okay...I'll buy that. We'll move on and come back later.
Says the United States of America.
'Every week by forty million people. I am a respected journalist.' Have you won any awards?
Say it. Scream it. All the way out the front door and into your van. And if you stop screaming, I swear to God I'll blow your head off.
C'mon, c'mon, let's hurry this up.
...developed between the three of us. We're kindda in this together, don't ya think?
And they made the first move?
I admire them.
Hypnotizing.
Apparently, they've seen all our films.
The entire wing?
Roger, no.
Roger, do you understand what the word 'no' means? It's important we establish a rapport. Something as simple as a dozen donuts can mean the world to somebody who hasn't had a donut in a year.
Roger?
What's the travelling arrangements?
It's gonna be beautiful.
They passed the 'edge' along to us.
I see.
Mr. Gayle, do you have the slightest idea how dangerous Knox is?
No, no, no, no, no, no, I mean only two guys.
Three.
Yeah.
Who're you tellin' to get, boy?! You watch it, or there'll be some dyin' done 'round here!
That's no way to talk, boy. Now we had one of them union men 'round here coupla years ago. Stirred up a lot of trouble. They're always after you colored boys.
You a union man?
I said: Cut it out!
What's the matter, boy? Never smile?
Thanks.
And his age?
You know, man, that guy was trying to be friendly.
How 'you doin' man?
In Birmingham.
Yes, aren't you?
That's pretty good for a preacher's daughter.
Get out of here!
What?
Yeah. Knocked around for a couple of months after the Army. You been there?
Yeah. It's just like I figured.
Yeah. Well, I do.
How did it go?
What happened, Duff?
What about him?
What's wrong?
Everything you cook is good.
Baby, you're the best thing that ever happened to me.
You know how to box?
Pay is so damn low. I don't want my kids to grow up like Barney's.
Hi.
About ten dollars.
I'm trying to help, Duff.
Day work.
Don't do that!
Duff, I love you.
Ain't you goin' to say something?
A whole lot, Frankie.
Like a home, for one thing.
Well, it's better than windin' up like a bum.
See you, Duff.
I guess you'll be making' some changes 'round here.
I'm Duff.
How about a drink?
No.
My son? I ain't got no son. You Duff?
How you doin', boy?
Most folks around here got no use for nigrahs. Got to understand them, that's all. How you doin', boy?
That's the trouble with you boys! Don't listen when a man tells you something.
It's a changing time. Sit down, son.
Well, it looks like we'll be getting our new school.
I know just how you feel, son. But believe me, you're going about it the wrong way.
I'll be a monkey's kid sister! What d'you want to do a thing like that for?
Yeah. All a colored woman wants is your money.
Baby - want you to meet Duff.
Pour your own trouble, Will.
Shut up, Will.
Is she good in the hay? No point marryin' her just to find out. Is there, baby?
He's your son.
I want my wife.  I told you and told you. Now I'm gettin' tired of this shit--
Whoa.  No way.  You can't enter the kill zone.
We got any shots?
You didn't come here to destroy Wintermute. You can to save a man you love. A man who isn't even capable of returning that love. Such a waste...
She's very striking, don't you think? Are these glasses a fashion where she comes from?
What are you doing in here?
What the hell is that?
Ghost a steppin' razor...
It's the people close to me that tend to die... and I get the feeling you and I are going to be real buddies.  Terms?
And then?
You ran without us.
That could work, but the timing will be a bitch.
That's Lord Frederick Tessier. Owns most of Freeside. Wintermute's mainframe is centred in the Royal Family's villa.
Good question. He may not have intended to. The girl in question is Lady 3Jane. She's very important to us. The third clone of Lady Jane Tessier.
As long as you cooperate.  I want it now, Armitage.
You find out in exactly two hours and forty-five minutes.
Tell me the words.
Ah, Herr Case. And how is the artiste tonight?
I saw your girl yesterday.
Case... Yeah, Miami Joeboy, quick study. How you doing, kid?
Last I heard you cracked Sukura International. I couldn't believe it.
Where the hell have you been?
What are you talkin' about?
How much time you got left?
You haven't got it?
Wait... You hear that?
Hello, Case.
Why did you come here tonight, Linda?
Where did you here that?
I know who you are.
I had to limit your options.
Let's just say we have a destiny to fulfil, you and I.
I hope you can show more than you did when you let the Yakuza butcher Linda Lee.
Since when do sprawl doctors know more about nerve rehab than the Japanese?
He's a resourceful guy, your boss. How long you work for him?
What about before that?
I gotta know... did it work>
How soon is soon enough?
I'll show you how to tell what's going on. If things go south, you unplug me.
On a good run... yeah.
When I was fifteen Sense/Net iced my old man's credit record over some computer error. Once that goes down, that's it. He lost his business... everything. It destroyed him. I had to hustle arcade games for chump change. Dixie McCoy found me, figured I was a natural. He taught me the wires for a piece of the action.
Yeah... fine.
Case... Are you alright?
Le Vingtieme Siecle. We're meeting Armitage there for the midnight floor show.
The code's some riddle of 3Jane's. Once I'm in the matrix, you'll just have to take a shot at it.
My God... these people are insane.
I'm still going in.
What the fuck kind of questions are those?
What?
Synecdoche uses a part to represent a whole- as in " head of cattle", whereas a hyperbole is simple exaggeration like "I could eat a horse."
Yeah - isn't it amazing that those guys are our same age? I mean, they just seem so much younger, you know.
Just so you know, I think they recalled these cars in 1974.
Well excuse me.
Guess who I did it with last night...
Forget it.
Okay. If you've never kissed a guy, we got bigger problems than the underwear.
Senorita Josie.
Please. That doesn't make you a nerd. Everyone wore those shoes.
Bridgework?
Cuuuute!
Josie! Josie, how'd it go? Did he ream you?
You need my help?
Wannabes. Kirsten transitioned last year.
That'll teach me to wear white after Labor Day.
Don't tell me... You're Medieval Barbie.
A--flack jacket.
Don't worry, I'll straighten all this out.
Uhh, no.
What if I say no?
Oh my god.
You know what, though? I feel like I'm really ready to do it. To have sex for the first time.
You know, Adele penguins pick one mate. They spend their whole life looking for that one other penguin and when they find it, they know. That's the penguin they stay with for the rest of their lives.
Okaaaay....  That car's going to bankrupt you.
How can you just give up like that? You had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything. Don't you want more? To move out of Mom and Dad's? Pay your own bills?
No, I mean, no big whoop.
Come on! It's not that hard. All you need is one person. Once the right person thinks you're cool, you're in. Everyone else will be too scared to question it.
Plus, if you quit you're no better than me.
Are you crazy?! You can't do this.
No, you weren't. Don't you realize the only time I was really happy in the last five years was when I was playing ball with those guys?
I love the way she writes.
So what are you thinking for college?
You have to say that. You're my student.
I'd like to tell you that we all grow out of it, but that's a lie. Some of us will always be rattling cages.
Maybe distant cousins. They did have that egg shape in common.
That's sad, isn't it? He had to sit on that wall all by himself. He deserved to have somebody.
Oh my God! I almost forgot--I got you a meeting with the admissions guy from Dartmouth!
Josie--you make a really beautiful prom queen.
Proms always make me sad. They're so final. Graduation. Everyone's scattering, moving on.
The person I cared about wouldn't have done this. Everything out of your mouth has been a complete lie. I don't know you at all. For all I know you could hate Dorothy Parker.
I told you you could write, Josie Geller.
Josie, you look Rufus.
You ruined the whole thing!
By name.
<i>                      I've got something, listen now, This one is real good, you'll see. We'll send a present to his door Upon there'll be a note to read.</i>
<i>                                   ... Let's draw straws.</i>
The deadly nightshade you slipped me wore off, Sally... I thought I'd find you here....
If you went away, what would become of me?
Taste it.
Why not?
Then we'll both starve...  An old man like me, who hardly has strength as it is -- me, without whom... me, your own father...
<i>                      This is a thing called a present. The whole thing starts with a box...</i>
<i>                      Just a box with bright colored paper And the whole thing topped with a bow.</i>
You got your room straightened out yet?
That's Lisa - I gotta get to school.
I don't know.  COuldn't get the right price, I suppose.
Don't tell me it's not the gas!  Your mother thought she smelled gas.
Alright then, what is it?  Bird rabies? That cheap seed you've been buying?
I'm not afraid of you.  You couldn't kill me...He's in there and I want him back.  I'm gonna take him away from you and you're going straight back to hell, you son-of-a-bitch!
Shit, you can tell your old man he's a real chump.
Schneider shouldn't have called you out on that double.
Jesus Christ, you scared the shit out of me!
your timing was perfect - I was getting the third degree in there.
Aren't you afraid somebody could steal your car like that?
Hi!  You didn't have to wait.
"Rod's been killed - he got Rod. Just Glen and me now.  Can't fall asleep!"
Are you sure?
Disappointed?
What is it - What's wrong?
I think I better go.  I'm just not into it tonight.  I'm sorry.
Who, Jesse?
You created him - you can destroy him. He lives off your fear.  Fight him, Jesse!
Hi.
Jess?
Maybe we should call a doctor.
What's that?
You're going out?
We're going up to bed now.
Did she always have nightmares?
I'll need to take her things.
Well, I'm home now, so you can go right to sleep.  C'mon, angel.
And you don't want to keep him waiting.
Good morning, Jennifer.
Kincaid -- we should find the others first...
Have you ever done that before?  Pulled someone into your dream?
Joey needs us.  I can feel him.
Kristen, can you pull us out?
He's gone.  It's over.  Please don't die, Nancy.  Please.
Pulled night duty.  Trimble's sick.
Crossed over?
I wouldn't be so sure they haven't.
I've had some experience with pattern nightmares.
This is nice.
Take it slowly.  Remember, this is a dream. Anything is possible.
What are we going to do?
Bullshit.  Getting yourself killed won't do the kids any good.  Besides, we do have a choice.
Who would know where they were hidden?
Oh Christ.  Simms put Kristen in the Quiet Room for the night.  They sedated her.
Okay, straight talk only in here.
In there.  Charlie Penny owns the place. We knew no one would ever find it.  I'm not even sure I can find it again.
How is he?
That's enough, Kincaid.
I'm Will Stanton, and um...I've had a little accident, as you can see.
No, but seriously -- it's not fair -- so many tragic young teenagers with anorexia -- and that girl has an arse she could perfectly well share round with at least ten other women -- and still be beg-bottomed.
And then I... right.
Okay.  So what does 'just over the street' mean -- give it to me in yards.
Coffee?
No, I've never played anything cool in my entire life.  Spike, who I'll stab to death later, never gave me the message.
Sorry about not ringing back.  The whole two-names concept was totally too much for my flatman's pea-sized intellect.
Right.  Ahm... the film's great... and I just wondered -- whether you ever thought of having more... horses in it?
You'll have to prove it.  This is a great brownie and I'm going to fight for it.  State your claim.
Gardens.  All these streets round here have these mysterious communal gardens in the middle of them. They're like little villages.
Nothing.
I don't think so.  No one has said 'whoopsidaisies,' do they -- I mean unless they're...
It's a disease I've got -- it's a clinical thing.  I'm taking pills and having injections -- it won't last long.
So who left who?
To be able to do that is such a wonderful thing.
Why?
I don't know where to go.  The hotel is surrounded.
Eleven.
'Certainly.  And little Johnny?'
You like Chagall?
Definitely.  'You may show the dent at the top of the artist's buttocks -- but neither cheek.  In the event of a stunt person being used, the artist must have full consultation.'
Actually, Mel does his own ass work. Why wouldn't he?  It's delicious.
Today has ben a good day.  Which under the circumstances is... unexpected.
It still strikes me as, well, surreal, that I'm allowed to see you naked.
Well...
More than that actually, when you think about it.  You know, Meatloaf has a very nice pair...
As far as they're concerned I do.  And now tomorrow there'll be pictures of you in every newspapers from here to Timbuktu.
You're right: of course, you're right. It's just that I've dealt with this garbage for ten years now -- you've had it for ten minutes.  Our perspectives are different.
This is certainly... ah...
It's not going very well -- and it's our last day.
But... wait... there are things to say.
You disappeared.
I thought I'd give it to you.
But yesterday... that actor asked you who I was... and you just dismissed me out of hand... I heard -- you had a microphone... I had headphones.
Oh dear.  He wasn't friendly during the filming?
He's bringing a girl?
Bella -- this is Anna.
Do you want to stay?
Good decision.  All actresses are mad as snakes.
That's nice.
Bernie -- this is Anna.
Having you here, Anna, firmly establishes what I've long suspected, that we really are the most desperate hot of under-achievers.
Is this your first film?
Da Vinci?
What happened?
Hi guys.  Oh holy fuck.
Have we got something for you. Something which will make you love me so much you'll want to hug me every single day for the rest of my life.
The phone number of Anna Scott's agent in London and her agent in New York. You can ring her.  You think about her all the time -- now you can ring her!
Are you a fan of Henry James?
I did.
That's right -- Topol.
I have to disturb you when you're cooking the books, but there's a delivery.
Excuse me -- it's your mother on the phone.
You haven't slept with her, have you?
'No comment' means 'yes.'
So I get the brownie?
There's an understatement.  There are dead people on better form.
Don't give a damn about the famous girl.
Oh God no.
No, sir.
Just incidentally -- why are you wearing that?
There never will be, you know, unless you actually clean your clothes.
Groovy.  You should do more of this stuff.
Right.  No one else?
I think she said her name was 'Flintstone.'
Spike.  For God's sake -- she's in trouble -- get a grip.
I wouldn't go outside.
Are you sure you...?
Right -- well, then we have something of an impasse.  I tell you what -- I'll call the police -- and,	what can I say? -- If I'm wrong about the whole book-down-the-trousers scenario, I really apologize.
No secrets, Mister Harding. Let's get it all out in the open...
Yes, Mister Harding?
You mean you don't want their votes to count, Billy!
N-n-n-n-no, no, I du-du-du-didn't, I didn't!
N-n-n-n-duh-duh-duh-pl-pl-pl-pl-muh muh-muh...
My name is Miss Ratched. I'm the head nurse here. You've already met Miss Pilbow and Aides Washington and Warren.
Yeah, you ain't half so bad looking for a head nurse.
Mister McMurphy. Patients aren't allowed in here.
How 'bout turning off that music for a while so a man can hear himself think?
Well, say, how 'bout easin' it down a bit so a man don't have to shout!
Sorry to have bothered you.
Now you boys hurry along and wash up for breakfast...  You too, Mister McMurphy.
I'm not finished yet.
'Kay, item two. Tomorrow, and listen carefully to me, you ding-a lings. Tomorrow is the opening game of the World Series an' what I want is to take a vote on switchin' the group meetin' to later on in the day, so we can watch the ballgame.
Yes. Now was there anything else you wanted to discuss, Mister McMurphy?
I'm proposing a re-vote on watchin' the ballgame!
So do I!
Welcome back.
What's your name, buddy?
No, kid, it was my own stupidity, that's what pissed me off.
H-h-how's it g-g-going, Mack?
In ya go...
Say it again.
Shit! This is too much!  Chief, I tell you we're gonna bust outta this place an' make it all the way to Canada before they know what bit 'em.
Ya like that, Chief, huh?
In there.
She won't give me any more cigarettes!
Hey, Cheswick! Wake up!
There they are!
When do you think we'll be going back, Mack?
It's the questions she asks.
Which gets you shipped up to Disturbed for a nice little zap job.
Lobotomy!
Is that your sense of humor or are you tryin' to say somethin'?
You boys seem to think you've got a champ in there, huh?
What's the use! Hooee! It'd do you birds some good just to get a little exercise lifting your arms to vote!
With this thing! I'm gonna put this thing right through the window, that's how!
He can't hear you!
I'm the coach!
Don't you have any clubs?
Who told you that?
Big king... little deuce... another king... a lovely lady... big ten... and a trey... hey, hey, whadaya say? Ya hit or sit, Martini?
Hit me!
Whadaya doin', there's no one there!
Jesus God...
Yeah, but you know how society persecutes a dedicated man.
No, this is my first trip, Doc.
You bet, Doc!
When?
Pardon me miss, but would you mind turning...
It's just medication, Mister McMurphy, good for you. Now down it goes...
Shhh. Hold it down! I'll take you guys down, but ya gotta come right back up! 'Kay?
Yeah, buddy?
How do ya know that?
Put your money where your mouth is, Taber.
Ten bucks.
Out. It's the way out. So just keep it in your minds if ya ever wanna make use of it.
Yeah, we'll miss breakfast!
Got a cigarette?
You just come on with that three fifty and Martini will take care of himself... Your dice, Scanlon.
A dime.
No!
What you boys doin' up at this ungodly time o' the night?
Oh yeah...
That angel of mercy, he ain't a she, is he?
Hey, how ya doin'?
What are they?
You comin' in to hold my hand?
He's a patient, Rose...
Yeah...
Who do you like in the opening game, Sam?
What kind of crap is that???
We got your black ass now, Washington, wanna bet another twenty?
Whew! Hiya, boys!
They're sleeping, Miss. They're sleeping. An' we gotta keep it down so we don't disturb their sleep.
Not exactly, Miss. Not exactly.
Well, Miss... I would say... I would say, yes. Yes, he's crazy.
Is he in an asylum?
Now, Miss. What do you want with twenty zombies when you got a twenty gun salute looking you right in the face.
You better believe it, you sweet little thing. You better believe it...
He is your husband, no?
May I see your boarding pass, please?
You didn't have that with you before.  Prima non l'aveva con se.
Nobody here has any idea which way he went?
What?...
And, he's a friend of yours.  It's Dwayne.
No.
You...
Congratulations.
It's an amazing place, don't you think?
Hello?  Is anybody there?
Uh-- in case Dwayne wants to try to reach you.
You're limping.
You stubbed your toe, don't you think that's a sign?
Why?
Where are you going?  Just-- out of curiosity...
Well, how about those old romantic movies with those great stars, huh? Like Audrey Hepburn.
You okay?
Hi.
It seems like ever since I found out about this guy, this name, I've been kind of crazy.  Like I was on drugs or something.
I don't know what you're talking about.  Who told you that?
Very funny.
Really?...
And this is the thanks I get.  I did you a favor.  You never wanted to marry that joker in the first place.
Look, I just thought if you finally got rid of this obsession with this name, if you could get it out of your system once and for all, then maybe you'd be able to stop waiting and open your heart to someone real.  Granted, ideally, me.  I didn't do it to hurt you.  I did it for you.  I did it for us...
Been here long?
I'll look forward to it.
Faith, this is my mother.
I don't know, I guess I never really thought about it...  Is Larry here?
Scientologist.
But somebody wrote those songs.
What's he do?
Let me tell you something about love.  There are no prince charmings, there are no glass slippers.  Love is hard work.
That's where you're wrong.  I got one nine years ago.  I just never had an opportunity to use it.
A foreign land full of millions of Italian men...  speaking Italian with Italian accents and those huge brown eyes and that silky olive skin...
You can't really blame him for being upset.  It was an Armani suit.
A Butterfinger wrapper.
What's that supposed to mean?...
You expecting somebody you know?
What did you say to her?
I sort of wanted to wait to see if maybe he'd notice me first?
Not if you don't count the sixth grade.
He's heeeeeerrre...
Faith--
I think it's time we got some professional help.
Peter?  Peter was a mistake.  An imposter.
It means you're a completely worthless excuse for a human being, and the fates have all conspired to make you miserable.
Kate.  Thank God you're there. I need help.
So...
Don't call me doll, Larry.  I hate it when you call me doll.
Damon Bradley?  That's why you're here?
I thought she'd get a kick out of it.
Larry, you've got to tell her.
She what?!
It was an emergency.  I only lied that night because it was the only way I knew to stop her.  I knew if I didn't, I'd never see her again.
That's the guy you've been waiting for all these years?
Oh, it's you.  It's only Peter.
Right now?
I'll come over when I'm ready.
If you kept your ears wide open instead of your mouth
You got a real friend here, kid. Don't forget it.
Come on, kid. I'll buy you a drink.
River Street? I thought we was going to the Garden.
Nothing ever stops you from talking, Charley.
A steady job and a few bucks extra, that's all I wanted.
I always figured I'd live longer without it.
There's a slot for a boss loader on the new pier we're opening up.
You don't mean you're thinking of testifying against
What the hell!!!
Take the boss loading, kid. For God's sake. I don't want to hurt you.
How could anyone do this to Joey. The best in the neighborhood... . everybody said it, not only me. Who'd want to harm Joey? Tell me who?  -- who?
Terry...?
What makes him so special?
I think we're O.K.
I'm with Terry.
You know how the Sisters are.
In braids? That's right.
I know. I thought I'd never get those braces off.
What's that?
Here they come! The champion flock of the neighborhood.
Now what are you doing?
What made you want to be a fighter?
Shouldn't we care about everybody?
Terry!
What are you crying for?
Edie, your old man's right, go back to that school out in daisyland. You're driving yourself nuts you're driving me nuts stop worrying about the truth worry about yourself.
Edie... Edie... ..
I had to, Edie. I had to see you.
I don't want to hurt Charley I don't want to hurt you...
That  word again! Why do you keep saying conscience, conscience... .
Terry, you're bleeding.
Edie.
Edie, for years we pushed quarters into a cookie jar, to keep you up there with the Sisters, and to keep you from things like I just seen out the window. My own daughter arm-in-arm with Terry Malloy. You know who Terry Malloy is?
What's the matter? I've got something That's chokin' me. I've gotta get it out.
About Edie?
But it's my own brother they're askin' me to finger and Johnny Friendly. His mother and my mother was first cousins. When I was this high he took me to the ball games... .
Now don't give me a hard time.
Give me that gun.
Take your hands off me. What you call me?
...walk?
You can!
Who asked him here?
You're Terry Malloy, aren't you?
Hey, Terry, guess who's here... that joker from the Commission... .
You was our first Supreme Commander, Terry. Keep out of sight and I'll tell him you're out.
Is Johnny in?
Terry?  What do you want?
Nothing happened, he says. Some operator you got yourself there, Charley. One more like him and we'll all be wearing striped pajamas.
He don't, huh?  Well, he knows thirty-nine pages worth of our operation.
Go on beat it. Don't push your luck.
You want to know something? Take the heater away and you're nothin' take the good goods away, and the kickback and the shakedown cabbage away and the pistoleros  away and you're a great big hunk of nothing  Your guts is all in your wallet and your trigger finger!
Yeah, yeah Here's half a buck, go have yourself a ball.
But does it have to be in a cemetery?
But there're so many wonderful things to write about, Bob.
Well we certainly can't stay here. C'mon.
Silly, there's nothing in there to be afraid of.
Look!
I'm so frightened.
What can we do?
I've got the ropes loose now. I've got my hands free.  Be careful--Don't change your expression too much.  They must not catch on.
<i>Him!</i>  I'll bet he sleeps with all the lights on.
I love you Bob. I really do. Forgive me?
I suppose most of the others will have to wait for their judgement until after the next full moon.
The time...is short.
They are live ones?
Live ones where only the dead should be?
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
What do you suppose for?
Listen, Adele, the reason I called, that party is today instead of Sunday. About eight-thirty, like only a few hours from now.  So you'll have to get hold of Buddy, whatever he might be doing...
The FBI didn't tell you I was with them?
You didn't visit him in prison.
I talk to the guy you work for, Emil. He tole me your number and where you live.  See, I'm looking for an assistant and would like to speak to you.
You did work for Emil, right?
I'm not dressed.
I bet that's all the hacks they send out.  Otherwise nobody's left to mind the store.
You want to take her to my place and get cleaned up?  You come out of the bathroom with your after-shave on and she goes, "Oh, I had you all wrong"?
What?!
He's gotta know by now that I gave him up back at Glades.  He does, he's gonna try to find me.  Maybe go see Adele, see what she knows.
First thing we do, we get to Detroit, we find Glenn, then we find a window to throw him out of.
I think she's after Glenn.  The girl still with you?
How long were you with the girl?
You didn't tell your sister about Ripley, did you?  'Cause I don't wanna go through that again.
No doubt the man's got some big-ass security system.
They put a gun on you, you'll go back.
So what's that mean?  That you're disappointed by what you found or you're sorry you robbed all those banks?
What?
No, you dump the van, meet me at the airport. I'll take one of Ripley's cars.
I wanna be on the task force, Daniel.
There's a couple of points I keep wondering about have to do with the two guys that grabbed you.  Buddy is it?  And this fella Jack Foley.  I swear the man must've robbed two hundred banks in his time.
You get the key?
Now you see Foley and this guy Bragg come in behind us, whatta you do?
Leave it where it is.
You can live or die, it's up to you.
Daniel Burdon, please.  Karen Sisco.
Yeah, but I see you moved it up.
Yeah.  I saw one of 'em outside.
Other than we had so much fun the last time we worked together.  You gonna tell me why you're comin' to me instead of the FBI?
Yeah, and, as you can see, home invasions are big, too.
Hello?
Look, what you worried about Glenn for?  What's he know?
Jack, you don't use a gun, do you?
It was just a year, give or take a few days.  I mean, it's not like we didn't get along or anything.  We had fun, we just didn't have that... that thing, you know?  That spark, you know what I mean?  You gotta have that.
Oh, you mean of Bonnie and Clyde?  Hm. You ever see pictures of him, the way he wore his hat?  You could tell he had that don't-give-a-shit air about him.
That part in the movie where they get shot?  Warren Beatty and... I can't think of her name.
I mean if you didn't know who I was.
I mean, romantically.
Something I've been wondering, what ever happened to your Uncle Cully?
One last score, that the idea?  Move to some island.
Don't leave me.
You like bourbon?
Not yet.  Don't say anything yet.  Okay?
If I remembered you.  I came looking for you.  I would've said sure, let's do it.  But for all you knew I could show up with a SWAT team.  Why would you trust me?
Remember how talkative you were?  In the trunk?  Adele said you do that when you're nervous.
What were you gonna do with me?
I wasn't sure you caught that.
You know I saw you on the street.
Or I did it for some kind of kinky thrill.  Score with a bank robber the way some women go for rough trade.
You getting serious on me now?
Oh, hey, Studs?  We thought you were somebody else.
Weren't you expecting us?
Some people are going out of here. What if I told you where and when?
You don't wanna be standing there, the hacks start asking questions you don't wanna answer.
Tell me something.  What's it like, walk in a bank with a gun, stick it up?
I can't say that I've paid that much attention to 'em before.
And the guy sent you a bill for this?
You goin' right back to work?
Foley?  That you?
We thought it might be her husband. Sometimes he comes and checks up on her.  She told him I was down in Florida.
What do you want from me, Jack?  Name it.  You want money?
Dumbfuck Glenn was right, there's about five million worth in there, wouldn't you say, Richard?
What's it mean, "No Hair"?
The flight?
There were others.
I got a big score lined up up north. They wouldn't even know about it, it wasn't for me.  I could do it right now myself, except it's so fucking cold up there in January--
But you're sure we've met, huh?
Do we have a gun in the car?
Glenn, take the exit.
What's going on, Glenn?
Ripley?  You mean the wall street guy?
But you say he hasn't shown up, you think he backed out?
You want to get out of here, run, it'll warm you up.
But listen, Glenn.  If you're lying to me...
Listen, Snoopy, I'm on my way up to Detroit and need a place to crash.
It's a guy you know.
Thing I'm worried about is you.
Look, Glenn, I know you cool, but you don't have to give me no tone of voice, okay?  You don't like what I'm saying, you can get out anywhere along here you want.
Hi, Ray.
How's it going?
Foley?  Oh.  No, it was one of the Cubans.  Linares.
You're a fighter?
What'd you fight, middleweight?
Well, <i>he</i> ain't even here that much.  I like to know where he goes, but at the same time I don't <i>want</i> to know, you understand?
Got run over by a car.
Can't.  I gotta drive out to Glades, then I'm meeting Ray Nicolet at ten.
"Hey, yourself."
Was it Foley?
You like the wild ones, don't you? Tillman, Nicolet and now Foley.  You know, I've always said there's a thin line between the cowboy cops and the armed robbers, all those guys that love to pack.
A'ight, this time we gotta get the motherfuckin' trajectory right...  Okay, on three:  One... Two...
White Boy, how much is the reward on the man again?
I found a rubber.
Do you have trouble with your boobs in the uniform?
We'll ask Evelyn.  Evelyn?  Evelyn!
Now listen, it's hands off Billy.  I mean, you can put your hands on him if you want to, but then my hands will break yours.
I wish she could forget him.
That was a nice little stunt you pulled, buzzing the base.
Hey.  You.  Mr. Coma.
Who the fuck taught you to fly?
Good shooting, Danny!
Didn't you say test the limits?
Then why are you looking for her?
I didn't mean it.
We gotta face some facts here.
What's there?
Land of the free.
Sorry you're gonna die -- cause I'm gonna make it.
Fun today.  Like old times.
It's shorter than our practice runway.
It's not getting any longer.
Then wh-where do we land?
No baseball diamonds, Red.
Good luck over there McCawley.  I admire your decision.
I heard what you did.
Well sure, Colonel --
What's your name?
I saw you, I couldn't go in, I...just stood there wondering if you knew.  You looked...sad, and I had to sit down a minute.
It's all right.  Danny always said I see things with my emotions instead of my eyes.
What else can we do?
What?...
If we launch the third wave and annihilate their fuel depots, we destroy their ability to operate in the Pacific for at least a year!
We have bombed Tokyo, Mr. President. Radio Tokyo interrupted it's own broadcast to make the announcement.
The Chinese are sending out search parties to try to find the crews before the Jap patrols do, if any of the planes make it.
Fook ya!
It's your grandma's strudel that's kept this family together.
Let's go.
1 just did it for the reunion. I thought it would be fun.
You just have to remember... men are like houses and trade upwards... I thought you had a pretty good marriage.
They're waiting. Come on.
I'll call you Later.
I bet Dolores told Charlie.
What's the matter?
We're here on the sofa bed...
I'm still waiting for the mortgage check.
How do you feel?
Well, we got the prom coming up, all these parties. We shouldn't upset our parents?
Looking good out there.
In the abstract maybe. Get a grip on yourself! But when I imagine you going out with other guys, I feel... ah...
Where did you get that sweater?
Charlie, let's make love.
I'm sorry Charlie.
I want to know what's going on. Dolores told me that you and that scuzzball Michael Fitzsimmons...
You're going to blow it, Peggy Sue. Nobody treats Charlie Bodell like this.
I will be happy if I have you. I love you.
What! What about the group and my singing career? What about me?
I was at Lena's last night. You were terrific.
I'd forgotten how much music meant to you.
Does this mean you like me again?
What do you mean you and my father decided? Who the hell are you to plan my life? Let's get married and live happily ever after. Bullshit. I got knocked up. I had to marry you. I never had a choice.
I love you.
But I love you. I'll love you forever.
Charlie, I had a strange experience.  I went back to high school. And I spent a lot of time with you.  And you and Walter and Leon were singing "I Wonder Why".
You were terrific.  And I kept trying to push you away but you wouldn't give up.
Show her a good time, but for God's sake restrain yourself.
I beg your pardon?
Hey Terry, what is that?  Did Peggy make it up?  I've never seen that on Bandstand.
It was my idea, Grandma. I always wondered what went on at those lodge meetings.
The young man leaned back in his chair. No bulls would die today.
Coffee and a donut.
The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.
Five more weeks of school. And ten minutes past graduation I'm gone.  To freedom.
Why not? Polygamy's legal in Utah.
Damn that Charlie I
That's your problems The more women think, the more trouble they get into.
Oh, you're both so naive.
Peggy Sue, watch your mouth.
Isn't that awfully forward?
You know, dear, I think the pantyhose is a wonderful idea, but the next time you come up with something, please don't stay out all night. Just tell us. We'll believe you.
You know Mom, it's okay to have male friends. Besides, it's over with me and Charlie.
Teenagers are weird. And you're the weirdest.
I remember when you got that locket, too. You were so excited I think you showed it to the whole school.
You look exactly the same.
The only time people like Dolores used to pay any attention to me was to laugh at me or insult me. That guy, Doug Snell, who shook my hand when we walked in, he used to call me a foureyed worm.
You were always friendly to me. I appreciated that.  You know, this used to be a fantasy of mine.
I guess part of us never really leaves high school.
You have a blind grandfather. One day you're going to invent a machine that reads books for blind people. I read about it. You're going to be famous. You're going to invent a lot of things.
You're giving me the creeps.
Okay, you're not dead, but according to every law of science what you say happened to you is impossible.
The way I see it, you have an unparalleled opportunity to become the richest woman in the world.
Ah. This is a biggie. Forget sneakers. Running shoes, jogging shoes, tennis shoes. Fifty to two hundred dollars a pair.
The wave of the future! I've decided on our first fortune! I'll see you later. You just think high tech.
Yep. It's going to be a law.  I broke up with Charlie last night.
Look, I'm desperate. I'll try anything. But what if you can't snap me out of it?
Richard! You should be ashamed of yourself.
That's just perfect isn't it? Did it work? Did you find out why I came back?
What's the matter?
No! No! No! Peggy Sue got married! Case closed. I don't want to marry anybody. Goodbye Richard.
What?
Wait, there must be some mix-up. He was... the dog is alive.
Geoff, this is crazy. Zowie didn't die.
Drew, I don't remember inviting Zowie in for dinner.
I've never seen anybody punch Clyde before.
Come on, that's just a bullshit story. You said so yourself...
Drew, I know your dog died, but... get a grip, man, you're freaking me out.
I've never had anyone die before...  ...but I guess you get over it. I mean, eventually...
I gotta go back and do my chores...
Mom...
Are we interrupting, Andy?
If MacroSystems wins, an energetic, young company will be destroyed, five thousand Americans will be out of work. Moreover, the laws of copyright and anti-trust were enacted to prevent exactly the kind of bullshit Macrosystems is trying to pull.
What's wrong with your face?
Allright. Calm down.
Do you really think so, Andy?
Why, Beckett?
Thanks, Walter.
You're right, I probably just misfiled...
Perhaps... you're right. I've certainly been busy. With the Kronos complaint, a preliminary injunction hearing and the Saunders trial all falling at the same time...
Thanks, you guys.
I almost didn't make it to the bathroom, Miguel. I almost lost control right in front of everybody.
Why are you getting dressed?
Drew!
We're not skipping this treatment.
You're scared. You think we're near the end.
You want me to give up? Let this thing turn us into <u>victims</u>?
I'm ready...
I know that, Charles.
Take it easy, Walter.
... meanwhile, I'd like to prepare you for a colonoscopy, so we can take a look inside.
Your Honor, since Rockwell Corp. began construction, the surrounding residential neighborhood has been enshrouded in a cloud of foul-smelling, germ-carrying, pestilent dust. My client is being forced to breathe known carcinogens daily! Other residents are coming forth on a daily basis to add their voices of outrage!
Innocuous?
Congratulations.
Correct. I'm seeking representation.
Nine.
I was diagnosed with AIDS eight months ago. During a bout of pneumonia. I recovered quickly and was back at work in ten days. Since I was doing so well on the AZT, we decided against telling anyone about it.
Hell, they are staring. What's that shit on your face?
Big trouble.
I buy that.
Huh? Oh. Great. She's great.
Rayisha.
So Kenton connected the... lesion, <u>and</u> whatever suspicions he had about your personal life... to this woman, Maria... and blew the whistle on you. Suddenly you're losing files, and it's time to let you go. But, up to this point, you've been their Golden Boy, their rising star... Their behavior is... inconsistent.
One more thing, Your Honor...
PARRTYY!
I'm a law suit.
Get it?
What do you want?
You think I'm uncomfortable...
You survived your first gay party intact.
What?
I'll look over the Q and A.
Particularly, Charles.
A regular all-American guy?
What do you call a thousand lawyers chained together at the bottom of the ocean?
What can I do?
Were you aware in 1984 or 1985 that there was a fatal disease out there, called AIDS, and that you could contract it through sexual activity?
Do you need a break?
You've testified the lesions on your face were visible to the people you worked with, correct?
And it's your contention, that when the partners were made aware of the lesions, they jumped to the conclusion you had AIDS and fired you.
Do you have any lesions on your face at this time?
By the time I was fired, there were four lesions on my face, much bigger...
Hello?
Mom?
Were you recently promoted?
Apparently, Mr. Wheeler felt they were too... "ethnic" is the word she used. She said he would like it if I wore something smaller, less garish, and... more "American."
Objection!
The guy sat in my office! You can't get AIDS that way, right?
It doesn't travel through the air, by breathing, or touching, right?
Were you pleased with his work?
Let's put it this way, Andy: your place in the future of this firm is no longer secure.
Explain to me, if you can, Mr. Wheeler, explain this to me like I'm a ten year-old. This trial is not about a disease, is that what you're saying? <u>Not</u> about your understandable, if unfounded, fear of catching AIDS through casual contact with someone who has it? You're saying, this trial is about Andrew Beckett's character. Am I getting this right?
Sometimes it seems like society is <u>run</u> by these kinds of people.
How many gays do you know?
Your Aunt Teresa is gay? That beautiful, sensuous woman is a... <u>lesbian</u>?
And the way they work out, pumping up, so they can be macho and faggot at the same time... I can't <u>stand</u> that shit. Now I'm being totally honest with you.
Joe?
Did I ever tell you, I hate costume parties?
Now that you mention it...
In this courtroom, Mr. Miller, justice is blind. To matters of race, creed, color, religion. And sexual orientation.
... to suit their personal desires, and the rest of us have to live with it.
He was doing a great job.
You came for us....
You mean...tonight? With all those things still out there?
I didn't want you to leave me there... back at the ship...that's why I didn't say anything....
You did this? To yourself?
Been a long time since anyone's trusted me. That's somethin' right there.
What do you see? Riddick?
Canyon ahead. I circled once to buy some time to think.
We're just here to carry your light, aren't we? Just the torch-bearers.
So where the hell's God now, huh?  I'll tell you where! He's up there PISSING ON ME!
<u>I trusted you</u>, Riddick. Goddamn, I trusted that some part of you wanted to rejoin the human race.
They're already dead. Get on board.
Here. Make it easy on you.
Just give me your hand.
What do my eyes see?
...one cutting torch...one handlight here, two more in the cabin...I <u>think</u> two more....
Probably makes it worse. Dehydrates you even more.
He used that?
I <u>am</u> sure. Look, murders aside, Riddick belongs in the Asshole Hall of Fame. He loves the jaw-jackin', loves making you afraid, 'cuz that's all he has. And you're playing right into --
...need those cells from the crash ship. Shit, still gotta check out the hull, patch the wings --
You said we were going to trust him now. You said there was a deal.
Oh, this is a dangerous game you're playing, Johns.
Not a problem unless you're gonna make --
Stop it, stop it, STOP IT!
How much you weigh, Johns?
So you noticed too?
Just shut up, okay?
We cannot go through there....
It's the atmosphere. Too much pressure, not enough oxygen. Might take a few days to --
Why did I fall on you?
I mean, I mean, chrono shows we're 22 weeks out, so gravity wasn't supposed to kick in for another 19. I mean, I mean, I mean, why did I fall <u>at all</u>?
You mean that "load" of passengers?
Hasan?
Imam. Slow down.
The sled as a shield....
I had the impression...from the model... that the two planets were moving as one. That there would be...a lasting darkness.
Very big beads.
Found somethin' worse than me, huh?
Want you to remember this moment, Riddick. The way it coulda gone and didn't.
About how to kill us and still get these cells to the skiff. Goddamnit, we're just doin' the heavy lifting for this prick!
Aw, this can't be happening to me....
So much for your nightfall.
What, you don't really think they left with their clothes on the lines? Photos on the walls?
Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling my notes.
A doll alone proves nothing. True. But the doll was found beside the jawbone of a man -- and no trace of simian fossils has turned up in this deposit.
No sir, I haven't forgotten.
Well, Taylor -- we're all fugitives now.
The best. But we won't need them.
Nothing much. The remnants of a life raft. Maybe a small flag. The emblem of my countrymen.
When are you going to show me what's in the cave?
They can't convict us of that. You proved our innocence. Besides...  ... his culture is our culture.
Do you have to work tonight?
The blood transfusion.
'Dodge was killed in the hunt. What happened to Landon?'  I don't know.
Flight is a scientific impossibility.
Cornelius, why do you insist on provoking him?
Well, maybe they're not.
A toy. It floats on the air.  Try it.
Where there's one there's another. And another. And another.
Will he live?
Ridiculous. That answer is a contradiction in terms. Tell us, Bright Eyes, why do men have no souls? What is the proof that a divine spark exists in the simian brain?
Straighten me out on something. Why did you come along at all? You volunteered. Why?  I'll tell you. They nominated you for the Big One and you couldn't turn it down. Not without losing your All-American standing
Okay. You read me well enough. Why can't I read you?
Dodge ... he's not like me at all. But he makes sense. Held walk naked into a live volcano if he thought he could learn something no other man knew. I understand why  he's here. But you...You're no seeker. You're negative.
Scarecrows?
Who are you?
Why did you do that? Scrape off your hair?
Not everything. They left a hostage.  How do you feel, Lucius?
Lucius.
Who put them up?
What is that?
Let it be clear at the outset that all matters pertaining to this inquiry are confidential, and anyone discussing them outside this chamber will be held in contempt of the Tribunal.  You may proceed, Dr. Honorius.
Since the defendant is forbidden to speak in his own defense, he asks that this statement be read into the record.
Well...do you acknowledge kinship with any of these creatures?
A fort! Unconsciously, you chose a name that was belligerent.  Where were you nurtured?
Of course.
Because you're not unique. There was the one you call Landon --
You may well call it upside down, since you occupy its lowest level. And deservedly.  The eastern desert has never been explored -- because we've always assumed that no life can exist there.  Save yourself, Taylor. Tell me -- is there another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone?
What is your proposal?
Twelve hundred years ago.
Of course.
Then answer this: If ran was superior, why didn't he survive?
We're back at the beginning. I still don't know the why. A planet where apes evolved from men. A world turned wrong side up. A puzzle with one piece missing.
Cornelius and I have been indicted for heresy. Unless we can prove our theories, we don't stand a chance of acquittal.
It's humiliating.
Dr. Zira, I'd like to kiss you good-bye.
He's moving his fingers!
So what's the problem?
Sarge?
Hey Big Harold, gimme your peaches for the fruitcake man.
Youse a pig man. I hope Manny get dat laundry gig for' you do.
Don babytalk him man. Cocksucker fell asleep. They walked right up on us, he don do shit.
Where's he from?
Does he have a metal plate in his head?
Yeah! I got two of them fuckers...
La Dai! La Dai! GET THE FUCK OUTTA THERE!
Come on man!
First time?
...you know that night we got hit... I...
Yo getting there Taylor. You be cool now and I'll introduce you 'round to some of the 'heads'.
Must be somebody?
You been smoking too much shit babe. Gotta control that. Takes a man down... I remember when you first come out to the bush, you was straight as a...
What we got here a crusader?
So what am I going to do! Get one of my guys zapped so some fuckface fresh from the World can get his beauty fucking sleep!
Merle?
Then you jes gonna forget 'bout Elias and all the good times we done had? Right in here.
Right...
Vancouver, B.C.
A very small service. It doesn't even ask for thanks. How long for?
Betty, this is Margo West. She wants to meet you. Miss Mayfield.
I don't like being referred to as babe, or addressed as baby. I don't like your possessive attitude, nor your hints of secret knowledge. In fact, to be very frank, Mr. Mitchell, I don't think I like you.
Good evening, Miss.
Brandon. Clark Brandon. Fellow about my age. Lot of money... that he didn't make. Former American. Now naturalized in Canada. Social standing indeterminate. Manners not quite perfect. Scotch superb.
No.. not very well. And I like his friends even less. But..  If you really want a good dry Martini..
You're not paying for this. It's quite enough that you let me sit at your table.
You're drinking it.
Dance?
How did you meet him?
You tried to run away.
He could hardly help suspecting you.
Dance? Tonight?
Want to dance?
That man over there. He was in the hotel lobby.
He's a fellow with a very hard knee, and he knows how to use it.
He's not a cop. A cop wouldn't have kneed me.
Us?
That's the second round I've lost tonight.  That fellow hurt me.
I hated to go to that place.  I almost went to the police station instead.
How bad is it?  Bad enough for--
Blonde, beautiful, and sad--and nowhere.  Of course she might have run away--if she knew how.  And where to go.  She might have dyed her hair.  Bleached it before probably.  And changed her name again.  But look at this note.  And look at her room in the hotel. Her stuff is all there.  Hasn't a rag except what she stood up in. You don't run away like that.  Not if you are young and beautiful. No chance.
You'll be safe here.  I won't be long.  Help yourself to anything you want. The galley's through there.  You can make coffee if you like.
I'd still go through--even if I ended up in jail.
See anything?
Cold?
I decided I didn't want a drink...I'm beginning to wonder.
Nobody believed I wasn't in on it. I was just a dumb-smart collage boy, and he was my father.  I thought it was a legitimate business.  He was a politician, with fingers in a lot of pies.  I never saw the pies.  They had names. For the record.  Innocent names.  You know where that kind of money comes from, don't you?
It wasn't the time or place.  Don't worry about the note, baby.  I'm playing for my neck now.
Who'd believe it but you?  I took him out to sea and threw him in the water.  Even if they find him, what connects him with me?
I think you mean that.
Beer or ale, Miss?
Well, that's not getting us anywhere. You won't tell me who you are, or give any account of yourself. You won't even give me your address in the United States. Why? Unhappy marriage?
What this?
FLorida?
True. I was a bit irritable last night. I apologize.
This isn't a very good place to talk.
That's my hard luck--I'm man enough to tell you about it--and not be sorry.
Time's up.  I'm off the case.
You've got a couple of hours, maybe.
No, Jeff.  You don't.  He's not a murderer, I tell you.  He;s not a murderer.
But I tell you---if you'd only understand.
Good morning, Mr. Brandon.
Mr. Reed would like you to call him.
Mr. Reed, please, for Mr.  Brandon.  Very well. Have him call. Mr. Brandon is in his office now.  Mr. Reed stepped out, Mr.  Brandon.
What are your rates?
I don't like your perfume in my office. Make it somewhere else if you don't like Charlie's.
Let me introduce you. Mr.  Killaine, Mrs. West.
How about a cup of coffee?
The only answer I have for you.
It could have been an accident.
How could Mitchell?  After that act he put on up here, is it likely she'd let him in?
You do a lot of real estate trading, Brandon?
What's the matter, baby. Don't you like me anymore?
Do me a favor, Mitchell. Find yourself a nice secluded park bench.
I think we'd better discuss this in my office, Mr. Mitchell.
What do you want?
I saw your face this evening when the detective showed you the gun. You lied. It was obvious.
Nastiness. You're nasty with words. Why wouldn't you be nasty with deeds once in a while? You hated him--and I know why.
Mr. Clarendon, have you ever seen this before?
Recently, then.
You have two murders to investigate. This man's head was beaten in. And there's nothing in his pockets.
I have an appointment with him, right here, right now.
I need a receipt.  Sign your name across the flap.
You in charge here?
That's pretty risky business, Inspector.
You can find out the first part. The second part you have to take a chance on.
This is the shell.  What about the gun?
Scotch and plain water, I think.
So far.
This girl is a murderess, Killaine.
"Physical description: Age 26, Height 5  1 3/4 inches: Weight, 188 pounds: Light brown hair: Deep blue eyes: Small, perfectly formed features: Ears and earlobes small: Slender build: Wears size 4 AA shoe: Quiet refined manner: New York accent: No charges pending. No prior criminal record.  Mayfield, Mother's name.  Air-mailing you photographs today.  Signed Hubert Tollison, Chief of Police, Greenwater, North Carolina."  She bleached her hair, or course.  Would your sensibilities be offended, if I sent out a general alarm to pick up this girl?
Get out of here!
So-so.
She's just a girl I met on the train. You don't mind do you?
You shouldn't. You washed me up very thoroughly.
Rich? I haven't the faintest idea. Why?
I've always been a heel. I guess I always will be.
It's the only pose I have left. I'm sunk. Broke. I don't even have my hotel bill.
I seem to remember that you like to help yourself.
I told you she's just..
Right.
I'm sorry. I forgot about calling for you.
To Ann.
You're kind to be so encouraging.
Thank you.
Now first of all, tell us your name.
Committed to memory.  Forever.
I know, I know!  Gentlemen, let me introduce you to one of our most talented contributors to The Cold War.  James Penfield.  He wrote the opening chapter, on 'The Berlin Airlift'.  One of the best chapters in the book.
I'll have some of that.
And some of that.  Sorry.
I called you a taxi.
I haven't seen much of you.
Might?
Jeremy phoned this morning
To the airlift.
C'mon.  I don't want any Jones about this.
Bastard.
...an innocent interest, and found out that last year Vogue ran a series called 'Mothers and Daughters' Number seven, Anne and Susan Barrington.  Being a decent loving friend I went to the files and made a copy for you.
She's never written a book in it, but she clearly knew a lot.
The torture of small children--
Hold those rights.
Fortunate that I was here to keep Susan entertained.
Hello.
I'm terribly sorry.  He doesn't seem to be here ... No ... Yes, if I see him, I will. .. Goodbye. She's going to phone back.
I'm sorry about Saturday, Dad.  It was just impossible to get away.
I just might give you a ring when we get back to London.  There's one or two things I'd like to... Will you let me have your number before you leave?  Have you ever watched a commercial being made?
What would you call it?
Ploughman's Lunch.  Traditional English fare.
What have you got there?
And that's why you never went pro?
Friends of yours, huh?
Gonna be some people at my house tonight.  Maybe you can make it.
Don't you gamble?
I've watched you once or twice.  You surf like it's some kind of street fight.  You jerk along from moment to moment, fighting everything that comes at you.  Always trying to win.
How you figure?
We gonna jump or jerk off?
What's this?
Talk.
We're wasting time.
Where's Roach?
And I always knew I could count on you, Agent Utah.
Well is there anyone else here that might have seen him?
Eating solid breakfasts, Utah?
All the food groups?  Avoiding sugar?  Caffeine?  I see to it that my people maintain cardiovascular fitness.  We stay off hard liquor, cigarettes...
Surf conditions okay?
Three men dead.  One of them a cop. How's that sit in your gut, Utah?
Pappas.  Angelo Pappas.
Good move.
Yeah.  What's your theory?
Candle wax.  Car wax.  Mustache wax? Could be anything.  Guy's waxing his mustache at the beach.  Gets sand in it.  Wipes it off with a shoe.  Shoe scuffs the counter.
Johnny, it's the only way.
What, you couldn't have just left the thing in your car?
... Felony B and E, three months in juvey.  Better.  Felony assault. Postgraduate work at Chino. Excellent.  I'm lovin' it.  What about the brother?  Great!  Another model citizen. These guys really fit the profile.
Did that worthless punk partner of mine ever show up?
Johnny!  Uh, you, uh... should call first, you know?  Hey, where the hell were you all day?  You gotta at least call in or something.  You okay?
Cute.  He was inside for about 20 minutes.  The other guy, Roach, waited in the truck.  They were scoping it out, right?!
I say we call it in.  Get some backup.  But you gotta do it.  Harp won't listen to me.
Sure, he's "the Bodhisattva".
Those are cold.
I work bank robbery.  Guys I'm after are surfers.  I needed you, at first, but not--
You've been pushing too many Pencils, Dillon. Had enough?
You don't know how much I missed this, Dutch!!! Once you get this in your blood, you never get it out!!!
Billy's on it.  Heat seeker. Pretty sophisticated for half-asses mountain boys.
I knew this man. Green Berets, out of Fort Bragg. What the hell were they doing in here? You got any answers for this, Dillon?
Blain...  ... Just like the others... no powder burns, no shrapnel.
I can accept that, it comes with the job.
Don't know, only saw one of 'em. Camouflaged. He was there...  ... Those fucking eyes...
You saw what?
I'm sorry, Bull. It's never easy. He was a good soldier.
You're looking well, Dutch.
That's over the border, General.
You lift off in three hours.  There's one other thing.
Mmmnnn...?
Major, you'd better take a look at this.
We can reach an understanding on this.
I like your hat.
Let's not talk about it, it's too depressing.  Come on, I'll show you Thunder.
What's that long building over there?
The real estate possibilities are endless.  Most of the yard we'll just level.  I talked to a couple of developers, under the table, of course, and they said --
Congratulations, sir.
Mr. Harris.
Stop.  For just a moment.  Mr. Kross, I'd like to ask you a few questions <u>before</u> you sign. You realize that you're a target. If you weren't mine, you'd be someone elses, correct?
I... I would take advantage of it.
You'd be initiating a financial battle you'd ultimately lose, Mr. Harris.
You looking' for some company?
Mind if I turn on some heat?
Regent Beverly Wilshire.  I bet you know it.
Get in.  This side.
You may feel more comfortable. This is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour.
Every place has hookers, but if this hotel has hookers, they don't look like they're...
Let's talk some more first.
Sounds like you've known a lot of lawyers.
Where are they?  Shopping together?
So what a ya do with the companies once you buy'm?
All right.  How much for the week?
It'd cost you.
Three.
You're upset, huh?
Yeah, it's this box, it has pictures, sound.  You don't have to use your brain at all.
You still mad at'm?
What id we run into someone I know?
You could freeze ice on his wife's ass.  She anything like your ex?
Edward, these women here, I don't think any of'm like the guys they're with.  They're just into it for the money.
You asshole!  I can't believe what a --!
Clean the slut up, take her out, huh?!  What are you trying to prove!?  I'm not a piece of meat for you to offer to your friends!
What was I supposed to do?  I told the truth.  Why should the truth upset you?  It's not as if you're from a convent.
Fuck off.
What if I lose it?
What if someone tries to steal it?
If it's in Italian, how will I know what they're saying?
I've never treated you like a whore.
What did you do to him?
Mr. Harris, a guest of yours, is a guest of ours and shall be treated accordingly.  The young lady asked me to tell you that she is waiting for you in the lounge.
Good afternoon, Mr. Harris.
At least stay for a drink.  This party's for you.
Cynthia's not coming?
Bill, we're businessmen, not the damn mafia.  I'll see you in the office.  By the way, about your car...
What!?
Doing what?
This is no time to disappear. We're in too far.
All this because of that whore!
I thought you were giving up that drug shit.
Looks slow tonight.
'Lo.
Hey Kit, where do I go for the clothes?  Good stuff on <u>him</u>.
Who did you think?
Yeah... I know what you mean.
It was great.
Want a pair of boots?
I want to.  For food, got it? Eat something before the wind blows you away.
Yeah, what?
You bullshittin' me?
Housekeeping.  I come to turn down the bed.  5:00, I turn down the bed.
What's your name?
I think you'll find it normal enough.
You'll like it fine.
In fifteen minutes I can teach you everything you need to know to dine with the Queen.  First, as you pick up the knife you shift your fork to the left hand.
Then you would use your--
Miss Vivian... there's a salon here in the hotel.  Instead of worrying unnecessarily about table manners, why don't you just have your hair done instead?
Hi, Barney!
May I help you?
You have beautiful things.  How much is this?
Would you like to try it on?
Yeah.  Sure.  Why not.  Call me at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.
I bet.  A lousy whore and you're the gum in a hundred million dollar deal.
Don't even think --  -- don't even think about trying to escape. The chains are far too thick. And don't dream of being rescued either. The only way in is secret. And only the Prince, the Count, and I know how to get in and out.
Every ship but the four you sent.
You don't seem excited, my little muffin.
I never said he was my dearest love. And yes, he will save me. That I know.
He knows I do not love him.
On the high seas, your ship attacked, and the Dread Pirate Roberts never takes prisoners.
You mock my pain!
Does it bother you to hear?
But how can you be sure?
Can you move at all?
I told you, "I would always come for you." Why didn't you wait for me?
Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while.
This will all soon be but a happy memory because Roberts' ship "Revenge" is anchored at the far end. And I, as you know, am Roberts.
We did it.
Oh, Westley, darling.  Westley, why won't you hold me?
At a time like this that's all you can think to say? "Gently?"
But it did. I was there. This old man said, "Man and wife."
We face each other as God intended. Sportsmanlike. No tricks, no weapons, skill against skill alone.
You be careful.  -- people in masks cannot be trusted.
Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.
Hello.
You don't look so good.  You don't smell so good either.
No -- not Vizzini -- I need the Man in Black --
The Man in Black?
Will this do?
-- wait, just wait --
Skip on to the Fire Swamp -- that sounded good.
You read that wrong. She doesn't marry Humperdinck, she marries Westley. I'm just sure of it. After all that Westley did for her, if she does not marry him, it wouldn't be fair.
No! I'm okay. I'm okay.  -- sit down. All right?
Yellin.
She will not be murdered. On the day of the wedding, I want the Thieves' Forest emptied and every inhabitant arrested.
Double it. My Princess must be safe.
Ah, but how will you capture us? We know the secrets of the Fire Swamp. We can live there quite happily for some time. So, whenever you feel like dying, feel free to visit.
For the last time -- SURRENDER!
She's been like that ever since the Fire Swamp.  It's my father's failing health that's upsetting her.
I could never cause you grief; consider our wedding off.  You returned this Westley to his ship?
Why? You can't even lift one.
You know, it's very strange -- I have been in the revenge business so long, now that it's over, I don't know what to do with the rest of my life.
-- yes --
-- anything you want --
What? What?
Thank you for everything.
You don't know any way you'll trust me?
We'll wait until you're ready.
How old were you?
Who are you?!
Making sure nobody's following us.
Stop doing that. We can all relax, it's almost over-
He didn't fall? Inconceivable!!
You guessed wrong.
Think it'll work?
Yes.  Dopey show-girls in gooey gowns.  Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn- turn-kick-turn!  It's enough to make you throw up!  At last a chance to do straight drama!  To deal with conflict, with inner truth.  Roger De Bris presents history.  Of course, I think we should add a little music.  That whole third act has got to go. They're losing the war.  It's too depressing.  We'll have to put something in there.  Aaahghhh!  I see it!  A line of beautiful girls, dressed as Storm Troopers, black patent leather boots, all marching together... Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn-turn- kick-turn!
"Of the silvery mooooon,
"He's gonna croon love's tune,
Enough.  It's better.  Please, Lambchop, it's better.  Stop. You're hurting it again.
All right.  Get a hold of yourself. Take a deep breath, let it out slowly and tell me who you are.
Good, what is it?
This is hardly a time for levity. I've discovered a serious error here in the accounts of your last play.
Help!
Yes, what?
Assume away!
So what?  What did it get me?  I'm wearing a cardboard belt.
See?  You could have raised a million dollars, put on a sixty thousand dollar flop and kept the rest.
Will you get a hold on yourself.
Okay.  I'm way over here.  Is that better?
Good.  Good.  That's nice.  That's very nice.  I think I'm coming out of it now.  Yes.  Yes.  I'm definitely coming out of it.  Thank you for smiling.  It helped a great deal.
Okay ... Max!  And you can call me Leo.
Nonsense!  As far as Whitehall and Marks are concerned, you're working with Bialystock, right?
You bet your boots, Leo.  It's Bialystock and Bloom -- on the rise. Upward and onward.  Say, you'll join me.  Nothing can stop us.
Well, it's... uh... it's nice and long... I mean, it's... uh... uh... where do you keep your wallet?
"I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy ...
Oh, sure.  I used to take him his hot milk and his opium.  Achhh, those were the days.  Vat good times ve had.  Dinner parties vit lovely ladies and gentlemen, singing und dancing.  You know, not many people knew about it, but the Fuhrer vas a terrific dancer.
That's because you were taken in by that verdampter Allied propaganda. Such filthy lies.  But nobody said a bad vord about Winston Churchill, did they?  Oh no, Vin Vit Vinnie!  Churchill, vit his cigars and his brandy and his rotten paintings. Couldn't even say Nazi.  He would say Narzis, Narzis.  Ve vere not Narzies, ve vere Nazis.  But let me tell this, and you're getting it straight from the horse, Hitler vas better looking than Churchill, he vas a better dresser than Churchill, had more hair, told funnier jokes, and could dance the pants off Churchill!
Plus to minus.  Negative to positive. Male to...
Min Bialystock.
Good.  Good.  We go Motel.
You, Blum go Motel.
Finder's keepers.
Feeling better?
Wait.  Wait.  We can't play today. I have too many appointments.
Of course, the check, I had it with me all the time.
Til Thursday, my Darling, I shall count the minutes.
I solemnly swear...
By the sacred memory...
Wagner...
No, not at all sir, we're quite serious.  We want to produce your play.  I have the contracts right here.
"Deutchland, Deutchland, uber alles, Uber alles in der velt."
Yes.  The actors.  I must destroy the actors.
Where's Goebbels?  Where's my little Joe?
You out to buy a motel?
Oh. I thought... you said you'd been to so many in two days...  What was it you wanted to ask?
No. At least I don't recall.
Now there's a couple even remarking about your sign, and see how easily you forgot them?
The following morning. Sunday.
No.
What do you mean?
Oh. My private parlor. She had an awful hunger... so I made her some supper. And then she went to bed and left in the morning. I didn't even see her leave.
Cash.
Why should she? I'm sorry, I have work to do, Mr... if you don't mind...
I guess I've got one of those faces you can't help believing.
She's... ill. Confined to her room. It's practically living alone.
I'm not a fool! And I'm not capable of being fooled! Not even by women!
What's your interest?
I'm in no mood for trouble!
Sick of the sight of it!  Well, suppose you look around for something that strikes your eyes and meanwhile I'll have my mechanic give yours the once over and... want some coffee? I was just about...
That's the one I'd've picked for you myself!
Well... heck, this is the first time I ever saw the customer high-pressure the salesman!  I'd figure roughly...  ...your car plus five hundred.
Aha! Always got time to argue money, huh...?
I think you'd better give it a trial spin. Don't want any bad word of mouth about California Charlie.
Isn't Mr. Lowery back from lunch?
Were there any calls?
You better run out to the house. She may be... unable to answer the phone...
Will you help us? I think something's wrong out there!
Mary had been there, one night, and had left.
Yes.
Yes?
Is something wrong?
What's the matter?
What thing?
Well why didn't she come to me... call me...?
She haven't even called you?
No. I just think... anything can be explained. But Mary, doing a thing like this... I don't know how to handle...
Hundreds! Which one is your pet?
You want to run out there, bust in on Arbogast and the sick old lady, shake her up and maybe spoil everything Arbogast's been building for the last three hours.
Arbogast said...
No Arbogast. No Bates. And only the old lady at home...  A sick old lady unable to answer the door... or unwilling.
Where'd you go to college?
I wonder so many things about her now.  Why she never told me about you...  Funny, when you think there's an answer to everything, you think you know all the answers.
Do you know how I found out about you? I found one of your letters... it was a nice letter, Sam.
We should have asked for Cabin One... The one Mary was in.
Okay. What do we do instead, write each other lurid love letters?
I'm fed up with sweating for people who aren't there. I sweat to pay off my father's debts... and he's in his grave... I sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony, and she's living on the other side of the world somewhere.
Hey, we can leave together can't we?
Dirty night.
I want sleep more than anything. Except maybe, food.
I'll be in the office if you want anything... just tap on the wall.
I've caused you some trouble.
You're very... kind.
You eat like a bird.
I'm looking for a private island.
Why do you ask that?
If anyone ever spoke to me, the way I heard... The way she spoke to you, I don't think I could ever laugh again.
An Institution? A madhouse?  People always call a madhouse "someplace."  Put her in Someplace!
What do you mean about caring?  Have you ever seen one of those places? Inside? Laughing and tears and cruel eyes studying you... and my mother there?  Why? has she harmed you? She's as harmless as... one of these stuffed birds.
I've suggested it myself. But I hate to even think such a thing.  She needs me... and it isn't...  ...it isn't as if she were a maniac, a raving thing... it's just that... sometimes she goes a little mad. We all go a little mad sometimes. Haven't you?
That's it.
In quite a hurry.
You slept here all night?
Wait a minute!
Bates' Motel.  He has a mind like a mechanical brain and the more information you feed it... Go on, Sam.
I'll get your bags.
Where will you get the money to do that, Bates... or do you already have it... socked away... a lot of it...
And then what? After supper, music? Whispers?
Mother, she's just a stranger!  As if men don't desire strangers, as if... oh, I refuse to speak of disgusting things because they disgust me! You understand, Boy?
They thought she'd be coming to me.
Everyone concerned thought... if they could get her to give back the money... they could avoid involving her with the police.
By gosh, them stiffs are get- tin' heavier and more of 'em every day. They even got the coroner working overtime.
That's the one that's got the coroner doing nightwork.
Don't tell him. I want to be the first to bring him the news.
No, I wouldn't be surprised at anything from you. Winningly. MAXWELL Now, honey--you are here in time to help me and you can--
That's what I said. Now, lis- ten to me. I want you to help me take this woman down stairs. I will give her a shot. You can take care of her till I get help.
Who wants your money-- maybe I can help you.
Yes--I can't stand it-- everybody wants papers-- oh, oh
I'm detective Jones. Just dropped in to tell you a bit of news.
By the way, where <U>is</U> your assistant?
What's that?
Take me down there.
Dr. Meirschultz, please.
What is it?
The child!
By the time we return there, all the preparations for the blood transfusion are completed.
The blood transfusion is now in progress. The only words are curt orders like: 'Now! - Quickly! - That's enough! - Give it to me! - Sit still!' etc.
The blood transfusion continues. Marc has positioned himself outside the circle of light from the lamp, so that he can see Nikolas in bright light, while he himself sits in the dark. Nikolas watches Léone's face anxiously and closely during her struggle with death. Life slowly seems to return to her, and her breathing becomes more peaceful. She opens her eyes and looks at the people round her, but she is much too enfeebled to speak, and closes her eyes again. Marc keeps a close watch on Nikolas, who grows paler and paler. His eyes swivel slowly from Nikolas to the patient and back to Nikolas again.
I don't have any affairs. What do you mean?
I've been in love so many times my heart is calloused ... but I've never hit one with dough. This love-in-an-attic isn't my idea of a way to spend a pleasant afternoon.
All right, you raise the kids -- I'll raise the roof. I'd rather die with an athletic heart from shaking cocktails and bankers, than expire in a pan of dirty dish water.
But what about lunch?
You wouldn't get mixed up with that little rotter, would you?
Nonsense. She's one of the nicest girls I know.
You wouldn't have said that before you met her.
If you will forgive this poor, crippled stump, my dear, I am very happy to know you.
Let me go! Let me go!
Hey, come here, Sob-sister!
Come in, Prussic Acid. What's on your mind?
I asked you to keep your trap shut!
And it came to life and divorced you. I know all about that. Now my idea is this: Somebody swipes the girl's body, takes impression, makes a mold, produces wax figure ... Bingo! ... Peddles it to this old skate down there!
Let it go.
No kiddin'?
Mit me, kid. I've got a classic.
Was there any art on Judge Ramsey?
Why would I string y'? They were sweeties until a month ago.
Don't give this to anybody else, will you?
Where'd you get the stag hound?
What do you mean police dog?
That's what I said.
Now look here. It's not up to us to do our own detective work. I've had enough trouble over this matter. I don't want anything more to do with it.
There she is! You'll find Joan Gale in that box.
Why?
--and so determined to live that I'm going to get out and take a taxi if you don't watch where you're going.
It doesn't usually take that long, but I'll forgive you -- you were in a tough spot when I met you.
Oh, is that what caused it?
What is it? What happened?
You are too gracious. These things have some merit, I suspect ... but this--  ... I am convinced, is fine.
It will always afford me great pleasure to see you.
If my curiosity is not too great, would you mind telling me what manner of animal this is you are designing?
And he isn't struck dead! This man, he lives! It would be interesting to know, young man, where and when you studied anatomy.
To lunch.
What are you laughing at?
I'd know him anywhere.
Spare me your classical answer. Measurements in.  Results taken.  What if I didn't miss?
I've been dreaming about you.
Could we go somewhere?
Nothing is real until it's perceived.
I know, Mother.
I am in awe of it, Mother.
Why, it has just made me ill, Buddy. I'm sick. I don't want to eat nothin', I don't, and me I got a good appetite, that ain't nat'ral for me. I'm ill.
Promise not to tell Doll? -- or nobody? Buddy, it's your Daddy! I'm so much in love with him I am out of my mind!
Well, are you satisfied now? Can we just lie and talk, huh?
No! You ought to be ashamed of yourself astin' such a nasty things a child your age!
Well, you're sweet, but you don't really love me.
You better quit that.
I must be outta my mind. Buddy, quit it.
Rose, are you all right? Are you sick or something?
Yeah, he tried to hide it but I saw 'em, and a little bit he says to me, "You know, you are beautiful." Now wasn't that a nice thing for a doctor to say to a patient, wasn't it? What could cheer a girl up more?
Oh, Buddy, they're gonna cut me all up! They're gonna cut my stummick all open, I'll die!
Boy did I get sick of rabbit. But later on after Momma died and Daddy wasn't doin' nothin' but drinkin', I sure would of been glad for a little rabbit stew. You know, I oughtn't to of told you about what Daddy done when I was a child. Until them rabbits ruined him, he was a real good man, Buddy.
Maybe it was eating all those rabbits that made you sexy, Rose.
Neither do I.
Of course not!
Reading dirty comic bocks.  And you admitted it?
Open that door, damn you!
What'd you say, Brother?
He's trying to get up -- good God, one of her titties is out!
Buddy, that was pretty snotty of you, pushing me away like that just when it was interesting.
I can use a drink after the plane ride I had.
What sad news? Did her cancer come back?
You know, I don't know this town any more. All this traffic, new buildings, prosperity...  Where have the years gone, Daddy? Where is the little town I knew as a boy?
That's what she would say herself.
Dead, Rose is dead? You mean... she died?
I can't believe it, Daddy. I know it must be true, but I can't believe it.
I am ahead of you.
It isn't the fourth dimension. To you it's the fourth dimension, maybe, to me it's simply the truth.
Good morning, sweetheart. Beautiful day.
How goes it, darlin'?
Um-hmm. Almost too perfect.
Well, let's hope for the best, darlin'.
I love Rosebud, I am wild about Rosebud. I just hope she doesn't turn out to be a hidden hotcha character, that's all. We have growing children in the house.
What's the matter, hon? Is anything wrong?
Lay off of that stuff, son. It upsets your mother.
Just half-a-cup of coffee. I never eat, darlin', you know that. Not eating and reverse insomnia are my curses. Let's go, Rose, you and Brother, let's hit the road.
-- I am not responsible for her epizootics and I did not bring about her epizootics. Now listen to me. When I have to get up in the middle of the night and defend my home with a shotgun against a couple of damned scoundrels fistfighting in the bushes --
Boys? You say to me boys?
Now you listen to me, Rose --
I'm sorry, darlin', I hate it as much as you do.
Now look, darlin', this is no time to go off into the fourth dimension.
Rosebud looked pretty pitiful in that bed.  I hope she'll be all right, but I still think we ought to fire her.
She's like a different person. Being so sick made a big impression on her. I really think she's learned a lesson.
She does look a little peaky.
I don't know how you can call it ideal -- don't you know what the word "farm" means to her?
I'd say about three months. Are you satisfied?
Reluctantly, I do. It would be a blessing to her and everyone else. The girl is oversexed and I say -- spay her!
Rose isn't oversexed, that's ridiculous. If you're going to talk nonsense, I don't want to talk to you at all. Rose is exactly the same as the rest of us, except more so.
Rosebird Baby, you are the light of my life, darlin'. How did we ever get by without you?
Ahh-hem! Now, Rose, get off my lap. What are you doing, girl? Are you crazy?
How can the buttons stand the pressure?
Ohhh-hh, ohhh...
Well, I know it, I just got the bill for it.
I got an awful bad cold.
I mean a human investment, Rose, we care about you, you matter to us. But we have innocent and unformed children in this house and the monkey and dog show has got to stop. Do you hear me?
There ain't nobody here, Mr. Hillyer! Honest, there ain't!
God forbid. You're not sick, Rose, forget it. Don't get any notions in your head, you're not sick.
Ahh-hh, you'll like it. It's a fine, outdoor-type job.
I'm not cryin' because of me, I'm cryin' because of somebody else.
Yes, I am.
You're looking very chipper this morning, Rose. Sow do you feel?
Well, no, I didn't actually.
Well, got to get a plane to Savannah. Great running into you, Buddy. Give my best to your Daddy.
You might see her. She writes your Daddy, and she and that doctor came to see him, didn't they? I wish you'd tell her something... I never could write letters.
Daddy, Buddy was up late last night reading little dirty comic books. Mother gave him a dose of castor oil and he cursed it, he took the Lords name in vain, then claimed he hadn't said it. He lied, Daddy.
What's the matter with him?
I'm not surprised you thought she was pregnant. An ovarian cyst can look very much like pregnancy. But it was pure wishful thinking on her part. The girl can never have children, she had gonorrhea at fifteen and it was untreated.
We make our own lives, Madam. As for malignancy, I don't think so, it's very unlikely. I probably shouldn't have even mentioned that possibility to her.
I'm sorry the truth nauseates you, Mrs. Hillyer, because before you leave there's a bit more of it I'd like to put to you. This operation provides a therapeutic opportunity that I feel is quite important in regard to this particular girl, who suffers not only from an ovarian cyst but from a certain psychoneurotic condition as well.
Rose, that scruffy-looking man is out in the yard again.
Well, there's no reason you shouldn't go out, Rose... in moderation.
I... I can explain...
I was going to tell him.
Indivisible and inseparable.
What Eve and I wouldn't give to meet up with you on the business end of a daisy chain.
How much?
Take her down to the car, and for Christ's sake be careful this time.  Last suspect he took in, butter-fingers dropped her down the stairs.  What a mess.  Why is it we don't appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?
Who cares?
It's six o'clock.  Time's runaing out.  Decide.
Kittle...
Oh, you fuckers!  You fucking fuckers!  What?  What do you want?
Hey now... what the fuck... ?
Tell me something... what's a school teacher doing having you meet for breakfast in one of the filthiest parts of downtown skank-ville?  I mean, this is not the place for fine dining, unless looking at prostitutes stimulates your appetite.
I... I can't find my seatbelt.
I can work this.
"A.D."
Okay, we got... one, two... three...  Two Caddies and Poe's Mustang.
I don't know what the problem is. Plenty of great men throughout history got their bravery out of a bottle
Dean Martin.
What's mine say?
It doesn't say that.
That's him alright.
Okay.  But, what changed our mind?
Let's go!  Fuck everything!  God damn sons of bitching mother humpers... I'm gonna rip'em all brand new assholes... !
Who said it wa's me, hub?  Anyway... he fell off a ladder.  It wasn't really my fault.
You plan on shooting that gun or just hugging it?
What about Jack Daniels?  Wasn't he a decorated general in the Civil War?
You could start over again with cash like that.
Our resignations.
You mean taking bribes, and skimming busts and letting hoods walk? You mean not being able to sleep at night after shaking down some honest Joe?
No.  Don't open your mouth!  You <U>honestly</U> think you can explain this to my satisfaction?
Don't bother.  This behavior's gone on too long.  You're suspended.
Well... seeing how you just suspended me, what's to stop me from calling you a crazy bastard, you old fart?
What can we do for you, officers? What new, mindless harassments have you planned this morning?
Couldn't have said it better myself.
You fuckers... damn you!  Why?!  Why me!?  Why the obsession with me?
Pardon me... my mistake.  Taking your thoughts in hand, huh... ?
Yeah... great.
Yeah, well... nobody's perfect.  They couldn't go doing everything at once.
"Go, go, go!"  "Slow down."  Make up your mind.
If they crash, maybe he'll run.  You can shoot him in the leg or something.
That's right, white bread.  Give it up.  Right now.
Alright, flesh-peddler, let's see empty hands!
If it is, that's pretty high up on the totem pole.  What do you think?
Been waiting long?
Hey-Ho... !  Maybe we're not alone in this thing after all.
Oh, yeah... the explosion.
Do tell.
We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.
I can't do it, Ben.
I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.
To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again!
Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.
But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.
Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.
Your eyesight will return in time.
Jabba's palace.
What is thy bidding, my Master?
I told you to remain on the command ship.
I have felt him, my Master.
Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?
Luke.
You got her warmed?
Hey, are you awake?
I'm sorry.
Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.
Good luck.
Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?
Proper?!
We're coming!
Ugh!
Oh!
Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!
Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?
No, you don't. You've always been strong.
Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict.
Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will.
Master Yoda, you can't die.
But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.
Well, I'm sorry.
How many languages do you speak?
You tricked me.  I wouldn't have - I've never - never.
Ahhh - no - stop - I mean Janet.  Janet.
I see.  So this wasn't simply a chance meeting.  You came here with a purpose.
He was a Science Teacher at Denton High.
It's as if we were glued to the spot.
So please don't tell me to can it.
Yes.
Uh huh.
Oh Janet
Gosh.  That's the third motorcyclist that's passed us.  They certainly take their lives in their hands.  What with the weather and all.
I think we took the wrong fork a few miles back.
You'd better sit here and keep warm while I go for help.
Then ask the butler - or someone.
Right!
Oh Brad.
Maybe we could try it this way.
I'm engaged to Brad just the same as Betty Monroe was to Ralph Hapschatt. But Frank's kisses overwhelmed me with an ecstacy I've never dreamt of before. Hot, burning kisses.
Hello.
Good God.
You did right.
You're OK by me.
What a guy
"Sweet Transvestite"
"Transylvania"
Want to come again and stay
Wheeling
No no no, no no.
I think you had better both come inside.
Creature of the night.
I smack 'em hard on the shell an' they get... What?
Hey, how's my buddy doin'?  -- Nice dog -- Well, I'll see ya later.
But you never had a chance to prove yourself.
I just dislocated my finger.
Some people think bein' shy is a disease, but it don't bother me.
...I'm at least half a bum. Yeah, fightin' is a crazy racket. The roughest part is the mornin' after.
After a rough fight, ya' nothin' but a large wound. Sometimes I feel like callin' a taxi to drive me from my bed to the bathroom... Ya' eyes hurt, ya' ears hurt, ya' hair even hurts... But the thing I'm proud of is I been in over sixty fights an' never had a busted nose -- Bent an' twisted an' bitten but never broke... That's rare.
Would ya like a glass of water?
I had it pulled. People callin' all the time.  Who needs it -- Who'd you wanna call?
You sure?
What's the problem? You don't like me -- Don't like the turtles -- What is it?
It's all right -- You're my guest.
Would ya take off your glasses?
...T-thank you.
How'd ya like hearin' ya name on TV?
Don't you open them anymore?
Like?
Don't be mad at him -- He just wants to help.
What was that you said about a pet shop?
What did you say about a pet shop?
It ain't so bad, 'cause I was a nothin' before --
Einstein flunked out of school... twice.
Nothin'! I want nothin' from you!!!
My side.
How 'bout this Billy Snow?
'The Italian Stallion' -- He's my man.
Apollo, how would you rate this last British challenger, Henry Wilcoxson?
You're referring to the much publicized bicentennial fight?
Hear she's retarded.
Kiss my ass.
Yo, Rocks, buy us sum wine, man.
Yo, Rock, gimme a dollar.
Few minutes?
Cost ya a buck.
Here -- Three minutes.
We would like to welcome our viewing audience to the Grand World Championship Bicentennial Heavyweight Fight -- the first major event of the Bicentennial Year... A point of interest is that the fight is being beamed to more than seven hundred and fifty million fans in theatres in nearly every corner of the world. I would like to welcome an old friend, and co-commentator for this evening's event -- Jimmy Michaels.
The Champ stings the slower challenger with jabs at will -- Balboa blocks eighty percent of the blows with his face -- Creed doesn't look the best he's ever been but is moving smoothly -- Creed snaps out a triple combination that backs Balboa into a corner -- oh, a solid hook by Creed, a master of fist-men.
If you had asked anyone who knows boxing, they never would've predicted a first round knockdown and the second round punishment to the body of the Champion... Most fighters will tell you, receiving a good body punch is the next worst thing to dying.
Why let Rocky here take a chance on cuttin' or breakin' a hand? -- Take a shower, Dipper.
Don't hit the face! Not the face!!
Here's fifty bucks -- You an' the girl have a nice time.
Here's five hundred -- Put it in your glove.
Ya gettin 150 grand killer. Ya got any plans for it? Whatta ya think? Ya like to put it on the street, make it work for ya?
Sure, you do what ya want. Stay away from the stock market.
Mr. Balboa --
How come ya wanna hang out with those guys? They teach ya bad things.
Make your teeth yella --
'Cause that's the way guys are -- They laugh when ya talk dirty. They think ya cute for a while, but then ya getta reputation an' watch out. Nobody's ever gonna take ya serious. Ya get no respect... I gotta use a bad word -- Whore. You'll end up maybe becomin' a whore.
Goodnight, Rocky.
...What?
Dipper's a climber -- You're a tomato.
How old are ya?
More like thirty.
Did ya win?
Rice is a bum.
Ya want the truth -- Ya got heart, but ya fight like an ape -- The only thing special about you is ya never got ya nose broke -- keep ya nose pretty -- what's left of ya brain an' retire.
Did ya get the message, kid?
A Rep from Miles Jergens' Promotions was lookin' for ya -- They need sparrin' partners for Creed.
'Bout an hour ago.
Fifty years, huh.
I'm sorry, I -- I made a mistake. Kid, I'm askin' man to man. I wanna be ya manager.
Tie it to both ankles -- Leave two feet slack.
Wanna keep goin'?
Yo, Mike -- What's happenin' here?
You were ready to bite that guy's face.
Hey, Rock -- What happened?
Ya sappin' his strength -- He's losin' steam.
Startin' with the bad jokes early today, huh.
Yo, Paulie.
She's a loser -- She don't enjoy life -- She reads -- Brainy -- Pushin' thirty friggin' years old!  She's gonna die alone if she don't wise up.
I usta be deadly at half-ball.
What kinda business?
Inflamed joints -- Walkin' in an' out of a freezer carryin' meat plays hell on the joints.
I'm askin' ya to go to him -- As a favor.
!! Ya want the bird, go out in the alley an' eat the bird -- I want ya outta the house -- Enjoy ya friggin' life... Ya hungry, Rock?
Why?
I'll do okay.
Hey, who cared about me yesterday, huh? Nobody -- I think I'm gonna train myself.
If ya don't pay Gazzo, ya end up hangin' on the hook, right?
Christ, I been beggin' ya for a break until I'm sick inside.
So much has happened lately -- Has it changed your life style much?
Do you feel you have a chance?
I'll tear his head off.
My hunch is it was Maroon.  He always was after Acme's property.
He comes here every night to see Jessica Rabbit.
Don't worry about me.  I can take it.
He's a riot.
The rabbit's wife?  Wanna tell me what she was doin' with her arms around you?
Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit again.
Are you gonna call him, Eddie?
Holy shit, he's a Toon!
You?
You're a pig... a happy-go-lucky pig.
Hello, Mr. Valiant.  I rang the doorbell, but I guess you couldn't hear it.
Yeah, I'll bet you would.  You gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work.
Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it is bein' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do.
So where is it?
Where'd this gargoyle come from anyway?
How much do you know about show business, Valiant?
Get me a couple juicy pictures. Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up with.
You don't have to.  The rabbit's wife sings at an underground Toon revue joint called The Ink & Paint Club.  You can catch her in action there.
When will I hear from you?
I Just thought I'd drop by and show you a photograph.
You're not too good at this, are you, R.K.?
Well, everybody needs a hobby.
The habeus corpus is thickening.
Hey, don't I get an encore?
Well... I still don't think he'd turn me in.
Gee, I didn't recognize you... I've never seen you laugh before.  That your brother makin' the rabbit ears?
Yeah, a Toon.  It was the guy who killed Bambi's mother.
Gee, Eddie, you're not gonna go, are ya?  Maroon'll be layin' for ya at nine o'clock.
Real good, Rog... but maybe you better let me take over.
Say Roger, remember that love letter you wrote your wife at the Ink & Paint Club?
Do you bite your thumb at us? Sir.
No better?
A challenge, on my life.
Ay me! Sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?
Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
Good heart, at what?
A right fair mark, fair cuz, is soonest hit.
Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
Forbear this outrage, good Mercutio.
Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift; riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
Juliet!
O God. Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood? O serpent heart hid with a flowering face. Was ever book containing such vile matter's so fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell in such a gorgeous palace.
O sweet my mother cast me not away. Delay this marriage for a month, a week. Or if you do not make the bridal bed in that dim  monument where Tybalt lies.
How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath? Is the news good, or bad? answer to that;
But all this did I know before. What says he of our marriage? what of that?
I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well. Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
I have.
Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight! For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
She speaks: O, speak again, bright angel!
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face, Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny What I have spoke: but farewell compliment! Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,' And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st, Thou mayst prove false. O gentle Romeo, If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
Romeo. What's here? Poison. Drunk all, and left no friendly drop to help me after. I will kiss thy lips. Happily some poison yet doth hang on them. Thy lips are warm.
Nurse, give leave awhile, We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again; I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel. Nurse, Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.
By my count, I was your mother much upon these years, You are now a maid. Thus then in brief: The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings, And soar with them above a common bound.
Too great oppression for a tender thing.
Why, may one ask?
Pink for flower.
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir. And you will give me occasion.
O, she says nothing sir, but weeps and weeps, and then on Romeo cries and then falls down again.
While Sam and I take out the back two cars...
And then Sam, you and I clean up whatever's left to be cleaned.
I don't know.  I was thinking...Maybe the three of us might partner up -- guns for hire, that sort of thing.
Best beer in the world?  Budweiser for me, thanks.
About time!
Sam.  I'm a weapons guy.
Part of me says I should just look at this as a perk.  You know, a bonus.  But then I remember you're you -- Deirdre who used to belong to the IRA -- and it occurs to me that deceit and subterfuge come very naturally to you.
And when I consider that, I have to wonder if you don't have some ulterior motive for being here, with me, right now.
Are you alright?
From here on in you want something you pay cash for it: no credit cards, no bank accounts are in place: ten percent up front, the rest when the job is done.  You.  What do you do and what should we call you?
Now then, let's run through it one more time, shall we?  What's your job?
We'll double your price.
Sit, sit...  Would you like one?
I'm shocked, shocked to think that you'd believe him.
If you're lying to me you poor excuse for a human being, I'm gonna blow your brains all over this car.
So, you've got it all figured, do you?
Then where is it?
A means to an end, is that it?
Not exactly?  But close enough, eh?  So he saved your life, then?
Are you sure you won't have a drink?
Where is this broad?
Perhaps the police?
He says this is their block.
I didn't know that you spoke French.
A cigarette?  As in one?  One cigarette a week, who smokes like that?
Watch that one, he's an ex-spook for sure, maybe Stasi, maybe KGB.  He's smart, Gregor is.
Deirdre?  Smart, yeah, and seriously goddamned dangerous.
I've wondered that myself.  None of this answers my question, though...  Why bring me?
You were once some kind of special forces.  Airborne Ranger, maybe a Navy SEAL.  After that you rode shotgun for the CIA in some place like El Salvador or Afghanistan, a real mercenary.  Only now -- now you're like the rest of us, it's a very competitive market since the end of the cold war.  There's a lot of hired guns out here, and not nearly enough work to go around.
The question still remains: what do we do now?
What's going on?
You see it your way, I'll see it mine. You need a doctor.
The Irish representative?
What's this?
Tell me, Sam: why do you do this?
Time to quit.
Would you stop with that...
The mark of a true Samurai.  What I do for the Company, Vincent, is no different than what you do.  We're both hired guns, and this is a job -- like any other job.
You have to stop doing that!
You son-of-a-bitch...
"Your field dressing saved his life." That's three I owe you.
You slept with her!
What I've heard so far, it's all a lot of talk.  I wasn't so sure what to make of it at first, cause, like I said, the Irish and the Russians are an unlikely mix.
Seamus Reilly, boy's a serious Irish Auteur -- a real firebrand.  Thinks his more moderate filmmaking brethren have turned to making movies for peace-loving pussies, if you see what I'm saying.
Tony and I have to talk some business, first.
What the hell happened here?
How old is Otis anyhow, thirty?
Thanks for the loan, man.  I'll have it in a few days, I promise.
I would have asked my sister, but its better to leave family out, always leads to trouble.
What are we going to do?
Call it in I guess.  Why?
Who's going to question us? Dwayne?  Jesse?
It's no accident we stumbled on this money.  It's an answer to a prayer!  Every night and every day I've prayed that God would just -- help me out a little, give me a little push.  Tonight my prayer came true.
I don't know...
Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note, or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
No we didn't.  He died on his own.
Shit!  We're gonna have to get rid of him.  I'm not letting some gangbanger ruin my life.  We can't risk it.
You're thinking about killing him. I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one.
I could kill that no good son of a bitch!
And how do you figure we do that?
You think he's bluffing?
Look, Earl.  We gotta go straight. This is all messed up...
Maybe we can reason with Jesse, give him a third in exchange for the tape.
How long is it going to take?!
What are you thinking?  We were only supposed to scare him!
Here it is.
Do you have everything?
We're not?  How do you figure that?
Dwayne's dead.
It's too late...
I was beginning to think you weren't going to show.  That can't be all of it.
You don't expect us to believe that do you?
Thank you.  Now, do you remember seeing any vehicles traveling near the site, on your way to or from?
Could it have been in the Mercedes?
Normally we would have tracked him with a wiretap, but it was standard for him to occasionally drop out when working with these guys. The last we heard from him was two days ago.
Hi.
Yeah I'm fine.
Like hell it's over.  You told me he wasn't doing this anymore.
You're worth every last penny.
I told him I bought the lingerie, as a surprise.  I don't think he suspects anything, but now you know, if he mentions it.
Can you rely on how much they said you'd get?
Sally there's a whole world out there.  We can have a new home. A real home, not some tin-plated dump.  What are you giving up?
What is this?  Don't be stupid man...
Why?
What do you think about all this?
Uh, no...
Not exactly.  It's some lingerie store on the strip.
Well...I should have done a little homework, getting all the sizes, and what not.
A lot of men come in here?
Jesse?
I'll do my best...that doesn't give me much time.
Something wrong, Jesse?
Hey where's the hot pad?
It was going to be a surprise!
I'll settle for a third of that.
Meet me at the Tumbleweed Diner.
I'm not asking.
Hi ma.
People have been asking me about that story in the paper.  I told them you were the first person on the scene.  They were asking me for all the details.
There was this raffle going on at the station, some charity or church was running it, I forget, so I figure what the hell put in my five bucks...
Well what do you know!  An air conditioner.
This whole place?
But nowhere near three million dollars worth.  I would say maybe twenty thousand.
Not in the trunk.
I don't know how else you'd explain it.  The coroner's estimated time of death for everyone there was long before this fire started, unless of course Denning started it, and that doesn't make much sense.
This isn't right...
Do you know what happened yesterday, Carter?  I was officially nominated for the Commissioner's post for the LAPD. There was a dinner last night, two hundred LAPD officers were there.
Invitation, please.
The band has been playing over an hour.
Hear you got your ass kicked in Hong Kong, James.
Look, I need some info and I don't have time to play around.
How'd you know?
What?
San Juan!  You must know my good friend Pedro Martinez Hernandez Hector Elizondo.
They use an optical transfer ink from India that burns red -- the real ink burns black.
Could you have your partner wait for us outside?
Do you have it in you, Lee?  Or are you gonna spend the rest of your life hiding like your father?
You're right, you're a smart guy.  Most counterfeiters only get ten cents on the dollar.  But this is an even swap.  Pure genius.
Did you see the way those girls drove off?  I did you a favor.
All I did was invite them for a drink.
You owe me a copy of the Beach Boys Greatest Hits, Volume Two.
Of course not.  My Superindendent invited us to a club tonight.  Big party.
This is a gangster bar, we're here undercover.
Carter, you don't understand.  These men are Fu-Cang-Long Triads.  Part of the most deadly gang in China.
All I wanted was a little mu-shu.
You're sorry.  I got somebody's old chopsticks stuck in my ass, so don't tell me you're sorry.  Just take me home.
I'm a dangerous man.  You're not gonna ruin my massage because of some midget in a house coat.
Carter?
Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?
Five years ago, my father was Chief Inspector working a big international smuggling case.
He found out his partner, Tan, had been working for the Triads all along.  Before my father could prove it, he was killed in the line of duty.
All the evidence against him disappeared, the smuggling case was unsolved.  Tan resigned and went over to the Triads openly.
I should go back.  Ricky Tan mentioned a boat in Hong Kong Harbor...
Is it hot in here?
I'm gonna go in the hall and get a bucket of ice.  You want some ice?
Wait a sec - what the hell is that between her legs?
Pick it up!
Wait!  There's people down there!
I'm not used to having a partner.
See you in the next world.
What about a little king pao chicken?
As long as you're asking...I think you have a pretty good voice.
Hello, Benjamin.
You've been a good friend, James Carter.
Red Dragon.
I'm this way.  I guess this is goodbye.
A little Mu-shu.
Stay out of it, Carter.  You're going back to L.A.
I know who you are, Inspector Lee.
Behind me is the soft count room.  We're pretty sure the plates are back there.
The Secret Service almost busted Reign at his casino in Macao, but the place burned down before we could move in.
... if your father were alive, I would be turning to him now.  I didn't blow up the American Embassy, but I believe some of my people did.  My enemies are trying to frame me.  There is a war going on within the Triads -- and I am going to lose.  My name has been written into the book of death.
Nobody can protect me.  I'll make a deal with you, Lee.  But only iff you'll get me out of Hong Kong.
Two Americans have been killed on United States Government property -- this is our investigation.
You don't move, you understand?!  You don't move!
Lee!  It's him!
Shut up!
Help me Rhonda.
You have one of these?
That silly-ass look on your face.
Shortcut?
What the hell kinda cop are you?!
I could not come.  I had other responsibilities.
You see what I'm sayin'? You control the space.
Now, that's American music.
That's not how it goes.
No, no.  It's not good-God you all! It's Good-God, ya'll.  Ya'll!
Not yee-aw, Ya'll.  And it's gotta be angry.  Like you're pissed off.
I'm sorry, Lee.
No, it is China, my country, my history.  If any of it gets damaged...
It's Hong Kong, not Tokyo.  My country asked for the best.  I told them that was you.  Now I will show you around my hood.
You got a lot of guts calling me.
Oh my god...what happened to you?
Yeah, if you're Superfly.
Okay, let me start from the top.  A few days ago I was on this munitions dealer named Lafontaine. Now, after the shit blew up last night...
What?!
You know something? Every time I see this stuff, it reminds me of...uh...a double latte grande...  With two shots of non-fat milk.
Yes.
You don't understand this guy.
I'm not running.
Right.
Actually, he only asked me one ridiculous question.  The rest weren't so bad.
Of course.
Rub your ears.
No, that's what makes you unemployed.
Yes, well, my theory was that she may be running because she gets attention... Negative attention is attention. Like when women whack you on the street because of your column, that's negative attention.
Guess you'd know about that.  You're an entomologist, right?  How's business?
Well, I'm off.  A reporter's work is never done.  Mrs. Pressman, thank you.
Hello.  I'm looking for Maggie Carpenter.  There was a sign at the hardware store across the street...
Oh, Betty.  I take it you're going to be making the wedding cake and they say you're throwing --
You should thank Lou and I for the wedding car -- a '63 Buick.
They made me put my hat back on.
Like her mother.
Give me that!
What do you mean?  It was incredibly romantic!
I don't know.
You look... uh... You look fine.
Ike... Hi, Grandma.
Oh, my God -- It's Miles Davis.  This is "King of Blue"!  This is the original recording.  Hard to find in good condition.  Where did you find this?
Your filter's clogged.  This takes unleaded.
Brian told you that?
That's called changing your mind.
Yes I do!
To who?  Are you asking me?
Yes, you!
You were not.
I'm listening.
Over there.  Ten o'clock.  He's talking to our little Dennis.  Dennis will turn into one of those "sources say" things.
But you haven't lost your mystery! You're very mysterious!
This party is for you and Bob.  Get your mind off the reporter.
Want to go to Butch's for a drink or something?
Thank you.  You still think that he was....
How about ... you're too narcissistic to commit to another human being in a long- term way.
I'll wait.
I was thinking, I have to go up to Boston for the AAP convention and then visit Winston-Hughes about switching over our computers.  Why don't we meet in New York for Valentine's Day weekend?
I don't know what to say about it, Walter.  It was a form of temporary insanity.  But I had to tell you about it because --
Oh, Walter.  I don't deserve you.
You should write something about this.
What's with you?
"Sleepless in Seattle"?
You're a basket case.
You are.  You're losing your mind.  What about Walter?
Right.
Do you think at the end of the movie when she's in the wheelchair they can still do it?
No.  That's the weirdest part about it.
Becky?
What are your plans in New York?
No, I know that part --
I'll tell you the truth, I heard this guy on a call-in radio show and I might not marry the person I should marry because I've become obsessed with him.
Honey, he wasn't right for you.
Go home for the weekend.
Oh God, it's major.  He's kissing her on the lips.  I have to stop this.
I'm Jonah.  That's my dad.  His name is Sam.
I mean, why did you get married? Was it all fireworks and trumpets and --
I know, I know.  I do not want to move to Seattle.  But what I really don't want to do is end up always wondering what might have happened and knowing I could have done something. What do you think?  It's just cold feet, isn't it? Everyone panics before they get married, didn't you?
I notice these things are back in fashion.  Oh, honey.  He's a lovely man, Annie.
It is, isn't it? You make millions of decisions that mean nothing and then one day you decide to order takeout and it changes your life.
Oh, please.  Destiny's just something we've invented because we can't stand the fact that everything that happens is accidental.
I was in Atlantic City with my family.  Cliff was a waiter. He talked me into sneaking out for a midnight walk on the Steel Pier.  I've probably told you this a million times, but I don't care.  And then he held my hand.  I was scared.  All sorts of thing were going through my head.  But after a while I forgot about them.  At one point I looked down, at our hands, and I couldn't tell which fingers were mine and which were his.  And I knew.
You know.
Of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department, so don't be worried if it takes a while --
Hello.
Hi.
Sam, if you're not doing anything New Year's -- obviously you're not doing anything New Year's -- we're having some people over, all of them married, not one even remotely interested in playing around.  Does that sound great or what?  I can't think of the last time I was at a party when anything actually happened.
Why not?
No last names, Jonah.  Hello there, you sound younger than our usual callers.  How come you're up so late?
Where's your mom?
It's very hard for him to talk about this stuff.  It's like it makes him sadder.
No.
It is not --
And that's what I'm trying to tell you.  What women are looking over, okay? Pecs and a cute butt.
Great.  They'll have a parade in your honor.  You'll be Man of the Year in Seattle Magazine.  Tira misu.
Eighty dollars.
Do you want a fruit plate?
The hopes are perfect -- beautiful, identical, smooth -- and they are for something really amazing I feel it in my bones --
How many people do you think heard that thing last night?
Dad, I don't know about this one --
Just out of curiosity, do you have any friends whose names don't begin with a J?  I feel like it was a failure of the imagination on our part naming you Jonah.  What is marjoram? Does anyone know?
I'm sorry.  I'm just --
Our house.  There was water coming in all the windows.
I... uh... have a date with someone Friday night.
This is a good letter, Dad.
Dad!
Jonah, this isn't fair.  You don't know Victoria.  I hardly know her myself.  She is, in fact, a mystery to me.  She tosses her hair a lot.  Why does she do this? I have no idea.  Is it a twitch? Does she need a haircut? Should she use barrette so it doesn't keep falling in her face? These are things that I'm willing to get to the bottom of, and that is why I am dating her.  That is all I am doing. I am not marrying her.  Can you appreciate the difference? That's what single people do, they try people on and they see if they fit.  But nobody fits perfectly, everyone is an adjustment.
Have you seen my wallet?
Fine.  I won't say anything. You can marry Count Dracula.
Did too.
What if I couldn't get to you?
I mean, so far, have I screwed it up for you?
Maybe we'll get a dog when we get back.
Do you like baseball?
Hi.
You look good.
I really wanted you to call me, and I thought you were never going to --
No way.  No way I was going to be the first woman you went out with after...  There is no percentage whatsoever in being the first woman anyone goes out with after...
We can't finish the job.  She's on her sixth painter, now she's thinking maybe she wants the fireplace rebricked --
It takes time --
I mean it. I know your work record. You were in line for foreman when this trouble started -- did you know that? You had a real future with this company, but you let those Reds stir you up. And now they'll sell you down the river. Why don't you wake up, Ray?  That's your name, isn't it, Ray?
Take a drink. Calm down!
Now why don't you let these gentlemen pass? Don't you know who's in that car?
How goes it?
Three hours! Just to heat enough water to wash this stuff!  I tell you something. If this strike is ever settled -- which I doubt -- I don't go back to work unless the company installs hot running water for us.  It should've been a union demand from the beginning.
It's like Charley Vidal says -- there's two kinds of slavery, wage slavery and domestic slavery. The Woman Question, he calls it.
Question, question -- the problem, what to do about 'em.
Hear you had a little trouble, Quintero. Defective fuse?  Well, you're all in one piece. So what's the beef?
Foreman wants to get the ore out. Miner wants to get his brothers out. In one piece.
We're only one payment behind. I argued with her. It isn't right.
We can't get everything at once. Right now we've got more important demands.
Is that all you care about? That radio? Can't you think of anything except yourself?
Was it expensive, the beer?
Drink, drink, Juanito. You'll never have it so good.
You are no good to me -- in jail.
Not just Juanito. You'll have it good too, Esperanza. We're going to win this strike.
But if you go back they'll lock you up again.
I waited up till midnight.
Where are you going?
Ramón -- you can't.
But you are needed. Especially now -- with most of the other men away. You're captain of the stand-by squad.
It's a lot to them. They'd do anything to open that mine.
Whose neck shall I stand on, to make me feel superior? And what will I get out of it? I don't want anything lower than I am. I'm low enough already. I want to rise. And push everything up with me as I go ...
Don't horse me. Price of zinc's never been higher. They don't want no strike -- not with their war boom on.
Because most of us here are Mexican- Americans! Because we want equality with Anglo miners -- the same pay, the same conditions.
That's all right -- it's no secret. My name's Hartwell. I'm from the company's Eastern office.
Well, if that's possible ...
Forgot what?
Luís! Come down here!
And another thing. Your attitude toward Anglos. If you're gonna be a leader ...
Are you Australian?
Fuck man. Come on, Bobby.
Yeah, but he was in silhouette.
Yeah.
Jesus, I look like a raccoon.
Oh God.
Oh, he's a keeper all right.
What?
Turns out I'm allergic to steel-toed boots. Go figure.  By the way, I'm not looking for a matching set.  Where's Quincey?
: What are you up to?
There you go again. You're nothing but false notes.
You think you're the only one down here with a sad story?
We been through that.
I need my paycheck.
It's not that easy. I just got a raise. I need the money.
Why not?
No. I want to know what the hell is going on.
Colette, go.
How the hell did we get this detail?
Why does it have to feel so bad?
So, why'd you want to see me?
Don't get carried away.
You remember that guy you told me about ... said he could handle a big hook-up?
Fuuuuuck
Yeah, that's what I mean.  Where the hell does this guy live anyway?
Why do they call him Pooh-Bear?
You want a hit?
What's this?
This isn't like that Queen Elizabeth question, is it?
You don't trust me?
Wait  If you don't trust me, why did you tell me that stuff about not using drugs?
By not disgracing her memory!
You don't understand.
I'm gonna get this developed and send it to the Warren Commission.
I'm sorry?
Pooh-Bear. come on, man.  What is this?  It's me, Danny. I thought we had a deal.
Cool it. We got business.
You think this is funny motherfucker?
I met the guy at a party.  He said he wanted to do a biggie. He's new in town so I offered my services.
Guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers.  As least that's what the word is.
What? Is it bad?
Murder.  Beautiful.
Then why didn't you help the kid when you were there?
We know what's going on.
Jimmy?
Speaking of which ... you run that license plate for me?
When is the deal going down?
Nervous?
You mean like the Donner Party?
You think that's a good idea?
We all know how much you like hearing that. Okay, Liz, I was wrong. There.  You happy?
Golly, I hadn't thought of that.
We're in business.
Where's Bubba?
What is that? Rum and coke?
They didn't want to give up those one-fifty-fives, sir.
Yes, sir.
As a matter of fact, I am.
No one's gonna win the money for the simple reason that the Captain never was a civilian.  They assembled him at O.C.S. out of spare body parts from dead G.I.'s.  I know this for a fact.
If we find Ryan and he's still alive, that son-of-a-bitch is gonna carry this goddamned B.A.R. back to the beach for me.
Last I knew.
You know what the best possible thing that could happen is?
Captain, my feet are most uncomfortable.  If I'd 'a known we was gonna have to walk all the way to Ramelle, I never would 'a volunteered for this here mission.
We left them eighty-eights.
How about that jeep?
You can tell all that, just by the sound, sire?
That only leaves three.
I wonder where they're going.
I'd like to stay, too, Captain.
Would they notice and eighty-eight?
Captain, what about our deal?
GO!
You?  Leading a squad?
Beasley's dead.
Fresh out.
SHOVES THE NEEDLE into Wade's neck. Thick vein.  Pumps the morphine straight to Wade's brain.  Motions impatiently to Sarge.
You know why I'm such a good officer? Because of my mother.  Have I ever told you about her?
No, but if I get any worse, you'll have to relieve me.
Uh, oh.
Sir, what if they send some other company into Caen ahead of us while we're pinned down here?
I don't think so, Captain.
Sorry, I need a B.A.R. man, you're the best.
I've given this a lot of thought, sir.  The best thing that could happen is, we find Ryan and he's dead.
No, sir.
Scans the Germans with his binoculars.
Leave him to me, Captain, I'll have him pissing and moaning with the best of us.
Thank you, sir.
Is jumped on by one.  Upham FIRES. KILLS the German.
Upham?  Good kid, smart, he was writing a book.
Frogs?
I usually like surprises.
Jesus, Reiben, think of the poor bastard's mother.
Sir, I ran the 220 in high school.
You're trying to get me to say something, that's why you're telling me all of this.
No, no he's not.
The, uh, Cynthia Branson estate was worth how much?  Because her family...
Why would you stay so long with an operation that is so clearly not a growth enterprise?
Hi.
Yeah, she won a fellowship.
Why do you eat that stuff?  There's no food in your food.  Not too loud, the red line's there for a reason.
But you never had a first date.
Then what's love?
You are such a great person Lloyd.  I'm a good person, but you are a great person.
Did you sleep with her?
I told him to be himself.
Wait a minute.
Why?
I can put that together.
Alright, no more, I'm going to save it.
What?
I won?
Morning honey.
Dad, maybe I shouldn't go with all that's happening to you.
It doesn't feel right to me.  I, I don't even have the right luggage yet.
I swear to god.
Don't say that, it's not good for you.  You're...
Mom, please?
You will?
Yeah.  I read about your fellowship in the paper, and I'm very glad you called me back.
Yeah.  I just wanted to congratulate you on your scholarship to England, and I wanted to tell you that I thought your speech was really incredible.
Whoah, what a day, huh?
What about tonight then, are you going to that party at Valhere's?
Alright.  This is really great.  Alright, we're going out. It's a date.  It's a scam.  Whatever, whatever, alright, I'll pick you up at what, eight O' clock?
Thank-you.
You know what?
Then call me tomorrow.
Boy, this is a mother dictionary.
Nice one.
Oh.
I think that's ageism, and that's, that's being prejudiced against people because they're old.  Maybe their mouths don't work as well as yours.
She's amazing.  She's ninety-three, she's a writer, and I told her about you.
Don't worry about it.  We're just having coffee.  We'll be anti- social.
Yeah, just keep going first, keep going around.  Get the feel of it, feel the clutch, when you put it in a little?
Yeah.  Now, when you feel like you're confident,...
If you'll just maybe ease it into second.
Little more gas.  Ease it up.  Hold on- minor setback.  Now you feel confident, right?
Now, go into second.  Little more gas... Yeah!  You can get  this whole problem.  Now, maybe you downshift to first?
Let's get outta here.  You want to?
I don't think so.
I don't know.  I'm happy.
I was just going to tell you that I love you.  I said it.
Okay, what did we just decide?
I feel like a dick.  You must think I'm a dick.
Then don't do it.
What do you want?
One more time would be nice.
I'm fine.
Okay.
Good to know.
Okay, I'll give here the message.
Yeah Lloyd.  What are your plans for the future?
Hi, Lloyd.  This is my eighth and final call...
I'm the distraction that's going to England with her sir.  Are you alright sir?  Are you okay?
Just her name.
Joe.  Joe.  She's written sixty-five songs.  They're all about you.  They're all about pain.
This is great, this gives me hope.  Thanks.
Ooop, excuse me.
Certainly.
Later for you, Luke.
Luck.
Should I stay?
All right, okay, let's talk.
You held back Stern.  You held back the one man most important to my business.
What do you want for him, I'll give it to you.
When?
Oh, this is "good business" in your opinion. You've got to move them, the equipment, everything to Czechoslovakia - it doesn't make any sense.
How you feeling, all right?
What's wrong with it?
I thought maybe you'd like to come over, have some dinner, some of the people are coming over.
One of these days the Russians are going to show up unannounced at my gate.  I'd like the chance to defend myself.  I'd like my wife to have that chance.  My civilian engineers. My secretary.
What others?
What was that about the SS, the rate, the ... ?
I could try to read this or I could eat my lunch while it's till hot.  We're doing well?
I'll talk to him.
There's a rumor you've been going around miscalibrating the machines.  I don't think that's a good idea.
I could've got more ... if I'd just ... I don't know, if I'd just ... I could've got more...
A one-armed machinist, Oskar?
He's stealing from you, Oskar.
I can do it, Captain.
He's broken his pattern.
You're sure about this two person thing?
Outside.
Yes.
Cici. Who's this?
Oh, I'm sorry. My bad.  I thought you were someone else.
We're co-sponsoring the Acid Rain mixer at the Sig Ep. house tonight.
WHAAAATT?
I don't think that's a good idea.
Its perfect, Sidney. No one will ever suspect me. I have proof. Im the victim.
No, Gale, I don't have any rights. You made sure of that.
Look, I'm sorry about the face.
Fair enough.
Well, you know I'm dear to the subject matter.
I couldnt believe you didnt recognize me. You even interviewed me for your book.
What are you going to do?
I'm sorry, baby. What can I do'?
About what?
Lemme take you home.
I had the four o'clock shift. You weren't there. You had us worried. Is everything okay?
Go on, untie him.
Yeah, were trying to send a message to Hollywood. Im really getting tired of all the happy endings. Its just not reality. In the real world the good guys die, the innocent are punished, and the murderers inherit the earth.
Two.
Where's Sid?
Yeah, you look quizzical yet pensive.
He hates Oliver Stone.
Of course not. Who wants to? Whats the point if we dont get caught? Wheres the glamour in that?
We had to have financing.
Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock.
And deep down I'm a good person? Make no mistake, Dewey, I'm a shit.
You broke my heart.
A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that?
And it's sexier in the dark.
Maybe not. But think about the sex. As frustrated as I am...
They're roomates.
Ssshh! What was that?
Dewey?
Who is this?
I'm sorry.
What?
Knock yourself out.
I'm the only one who can cut him down.
Randy Meeks.  He was with Sid that night in Woodsboro.
SHOWGIRLS. Absolutely frightening. What's yours? Wait, let me guess. THE HOUSE ON SORORITY ROW? FINAL EXAM. GRADUATION DAY? THE DORM THAT DRIPPED BLOOD? SPLATTER UNIVERSITY? Am I close?
Do you want to die?
I hate scary movies.
Why doesn't she just hang up and call the police? Stupid..
What do you want?
Do you work for her now?
I'll relay it. You sure you don't wanna go home?
Oh that's right. Those poor poor people. God Ben Damon was such a hottie.
Who is this?
What kind of a game?
Where are you?
Nope.
I know every face in here, respect for the unknown actor I suppose, myself included. If you're looking for Maureen Prescott --
So is that why you're here? Is that why you're holding me from my show, to tell me about some brutal homicide I'm not even involved in?
Oh. I thought you wanted me to stick around.
But you won't. You're a good man detective. We think alike. I know you need my help. And I know you know I need your help.
Four? There are five.
Jesus Gale what happened?
What do you know about trilogies?
Excuse me?
Oh yeah, how?
I told you, I don't know where Sidney is. And even if there was a third killer, Sidney doesn't know about it.
Is that a threat, Detective?
Nice to finally meet you, Sidney.
Jesus Christ Sidney, what happened? I got a call on my cell from home. They told me that someone was attacked.
What are you doing here? I told you to stay hidden! It's not safe for you up here.
Listen Dewey I have to go to the bathroom.
Yeah?
Dewey?! OHMIGOD! Where are you?!
What about me?
You used to say that was our strength.
Two months ago, the Woodsboro police got a call from a woman who said she was with 'Stab 3'.  She wanted to see the file on Sid, for research.
Stop following me.
Gale, your engine's still running.
OH. OH GOD. GALE --
Thank you.
Your life?
Geez.
Being Gale Weathers.  What the hell are you doing?
No really?
Possibly.
Nobody said she was an actor.
Rob Reiner and Quentin Tarentino?
Answer the question. You knew Sidney's mom?
And now? I mean, murders on your set and still you say nothing?
Are you saying she was-
I know!
I'm a director Sid, I direct. For example, Angelina over there,  She's my partner. I can convince her to do anything.  We've been dating since I met her in Woodsboro.
All right, since I got you on the phone, let's talk about your character.
Would you give that script a rest? It's like a friggen umbilical cord to you.
Do you think it's over Sidney? Do you?
If you lay a hand on him I'll fucking kill you!
You're dead!
Hello?
What? She asked.
Owwww...
Tell that to Cotton Weary. You wouldn't believe how easy it was to frame him.
Nope.
It's on the table.
I thought she was dead.
It just occurred to me that I've never snuck through your bedroom window.
Jesus, SHIT!
No... I don't... it's just... Oh God, Billy, someone was there, someone tried to kill me.
I wanna let go. I do...
You bitch -- where the fuck are you?
I'm gonna rip you up bitch. Just like your slut whore mother.
Yes.
What number are you trying to reach?
I think you have the wrong number.
So why did you dial it again?
Popcorn.
Just some scary movie.
I don't know.
Uh... HALLOWEEN. You know, the one with the guy with the white mask who just sorta walks around and stalks the baby sitters. What's yours?
That's not what you said.
What do you want?
Dial someone else, okay?
Listen, asshole...
What do you want?
What kind of game?
Please don't do this...
No...
I don't know...
Michael... Michael Myers.
I'm sorry. That's the wrong answer.
Hi! Gale Weathers. Field Correspondent, INSIDE STORY.
And why is that? Has something happened?
I'm twenty-five years old, ma'am.
He's not a suspect, is he?
Have they found my father?
It's Deputy Riley today, Sid.
I was first to respond.
They're pulling Loomis' account. But it'll be morning before we see something. You think he did it?
She staying with you?
Jesus...
No, not so fast. We have nothing concrete.
If I'm gonna blow this up -- I need hard proof.
It's okay, Tatum. She's just doing her job. Right, GALE?
What if she did it? What if Sidney killed Casey and Steve?
You're evil.
Aha, Randy, you gave yourself away. Are you calling from work? Tatum's on her way over.
Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.
So where are you?
Good try, Randy. Tell Tatum to hurry. Bye now.
Are you okay?
I heard screaming.
THE FOG, TERROR TRAIN, PROM NIGHT -- How come Jamie Lee Curtis is in all these movies?
Stop. Right there.
That was an ice pick -- not exactly the same.
You're such a little lap dog. He's got killer printed all over his forehead.
So what's his reason?
What's Leatherface doing here?
Come on, Sid. Give me the gun.
Or a man's mentality.
Uh-huh, it's just... you know, the police and reporters... it brings it all back.
Thanks, Tatum.
It's okay. She was supposed to pick me up.
Just another sleepover at the Riley's.
Just relax. You're at school now. No one can get you here.
You can't prove a rumor. That's why it's a rumor.
It goes further back, Sid. There's been talk about other men.
You're right. I'm cracking up. Ignore me.
Hey, Sid. Just think if they make a movie about you. Who's gonna play you?
What do you think about when you're having sex?
Who?
TATUM!
How's that?
What do you think?
Have you heard?
I'm sure everyone's doing their best.
Thank you.  Tell them, thank you.
He's being arraigned tomorrow.
And... and... and he said... he asked me if I was married.  And, I could see he had a gun in his hand.
She was... she was on the bed.  She was just sitting on the bed.
Jesus Christ, man, don't shoot me!
What the hell's going on?
What time is it?
You didn't know.
I hate to burst your bubble, but other than the fact that you're especially sadistic, there's nothing unusual about these precious murders of yours.
You wouldn't because you know there are consequences.  It's in those eyes of yours, though... nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work.  I won't deny my own personal desire to turn each sin against the sinner.  I only took their sins to logical conclusions.
A woman...
A woman... so ugly on the inside that she couldn't bare to go on living if she couldn't be beautiful on the outside.  A drug dealer... a drug dealing pederast, actually.  And, don't forget the disease spreading whore.  Only in a world this shitty could you even try to say these were innocent people and keep a straight face.  That's the point.  You see a deadly sin on almost every street corner, and in every home, literally.  And we tolerate it. Because it's common, it seems trivial, and we tolerate, all day long, morning, noon and night.  Not anymore.  I'm setting the example, and it's going to be puzzled over and studied and followed, from now on.
And, I remember breaking your nose.  You're only alive because I didn't kill you.
Just keep leading the way.
I wish I could have been a normal man like you.  I wish I could have a simple life.
Drop it.
Same color and texture.
This doesn't make any sense.
It could be nothing.
How's that?
I'd like you to meet Somerset.
The leather chair was soaked through with sweat.
For now, let's just consider the books as the murderer's inspiration. The books and sermons are about atonement for sin.  And, these murders have been like forced attrition.
You're sure your men didn't move this?
There must be something.
You meant what you said to Mrs. Gould, didn't you?  About catching this guy.  You really want to believe that, don't you?
All we do is pick up the pieces.  We take all the evidence, and all the pictures and samples.  We write everything down and note what time things happened...
We put it in a nice neat pile and file it away, on the slim chance it's ever needed in a courtroom.  It's like collecting diamonds on a desert island.  You keep them just in case you ever get rescued, but it's a pretty big ocean out there.
You tell me.  I'm new in town.
And?
How did the fire fight end?
Sorry about that... I just...
I'm sick of sitting around, waiting for him to kill again.
Well, he's been right so far, hasn't he?
So they ran our list.
How do you know all about this?
This is a waste of time.
The hell I can't!  We get in there and we can stop him.
By the time we clear a warrant someone else is going to be dead.
He's preaching.
No.  Face it now.  Stop thinking it's good guys against bad guys.
You tell me, then... you walk into an apartment, and a man has beaten his wife to death, or the wife murdered the husband, and you have to wash the blood off their children.  You put the killer in jail.  Who won?
Oh, you're so much better than everyone, right?  No one's worthy of you.
Listen to yourself.  You say, "the problem with people is they don't care, so I don't care about people."  But, you're already here.  You've been here a long time.  So, there's a part of you that knows, even if everything you say is true, none of it matters.
Oh, you want to stay now?
Throw your weapon, detective!  Now!
Tell me it's not true.
I need you to look at each one carefully... very carefully.  Look for anything that seems strange or out of place.  Anything at all.
I was close once.  It just didn't happen.
I mean, you known this city.  You've been here for so long.
Perfect example.
I don't know why I asked you to come.
I've been going to some of the schools, looking for work, but the conditions here are... horrible.
Yes.  Look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here.
But Mose Harper said...
Lucy's going on seventeen now...
Why'd they break off?  Was there water in that canyon?
As to that, I don't know, Charlie... We hadn't got around to talkin' marriage...
What good does that do?
What do you know about it?...What's a quarter-breed Cherokee know about the Comanche trick of sleeping with his best pony tied right beside him...You got as much chance of stampedin' their herd as...
I didn't give any order to fire!
I got to ask you and Martin to ride to the State Capitol with me, Ethan.
We can get within 500 yards...there's a hogback to the south.
I didn't <U>want</U> to tell you...but maybe it's your right to know.
Never mind...Your pa know you're out here?
You tell your pa a company of Rangers -- all fourteen of 'em -- fully armed an' equipped will be in the field by daylight...headin' for the south end of the Malapai. If he can catch up with us, well an' good...
Debbie, think back! I'm Martin... remember? Remember how I used to let you ride my horse? Tell you stories? Don't you remember me, Debbie?
I've come now...
Come f'r my rockin' chai'...ole Mose.
Mose...try to remember!...You were in Scar's camp...
How'd you come by this?
Sir -- we charged!..Gentlemen -- and I hope you will quote me -- I cannot say too much for the courage of the men who followed me into that Cheyenne camp...
You all right, Ethan?
Not so funny...if you recollect what 'Nawyecka' means...
<U>YOU</U> don't understand, ya chunkhead! <U>You</U> didn't buy any blanket! Ya bought <U>her</U>!
Beats me how she could get that pony out o' camp without neither of us hearin' a thing...
Lemme alone...
I know you are...Only it ain't goin' to be that way...she's alive...
I saw it...And don't try to tell me it was Aunt Martha's or Lucy's...
Was your niece about their age?
Hard to realize they're white, isn't it...
Why it's just a snip of calico...
They never find that girl.
What you gettin' red-in-the-face for?...I have brothers, haven't I?
I'm a woman, Martie...  We wash and mend your dirty clothes all our lives...When you're little we even wash <U>you</U>....How a man can ever make out to get bashful in front of a woman I'll never know...
It wasn't much of a letter...
But I allus loved you...You know that, without my sayin' it...I couldn't bring myself to ask you to wait...the little I had... not knowin' how much longer until we found Debbie...
Martie...don't go! Not this time.
It's too late...She's a woman grown now...
Do you know what Ethan will do if he has a chance?...He'll put a bullet in her brain! And I tell you Martha would want him to!
She'd be about thirteen now...
Ellen, move aside...
Stop that!
Hey... the fuse.
Look at this!  We'll have to fix the whole wiring.  This stuff is dangerous as hell.
What are you doing?
Cherry-red Tears, your first book. I read it at least nine times.  And then I found out you were going to attend some kind of book fair.
I was so excited about meeting you. Again and again, I kept getting in the back of the line so I could be the last to talk to you.
So, did you sleep good?
Who's that?
She was old.
Martin, what-
Oh, Ellen.  My sweet Ellen... Of course I knew.
You know, Tommi wants me to become the man I used to be.
How did you get me out of there?
No, I've never seen him before.
Do I look like it that much?
Listen, it's one thing to have a guilt complex. But I know the difference between when I'm overstrung and when I'm seeing things that are simply not there! Besides, it only began after we moved!
Stop scaring people.  Let's go. We need to be on our way.
Hammer?
Look at this.  The lock is totally demolished.
You are a gentleman.
You have the last act?
Burbage, I will see you hanged for a pickpocket.
We will all be put in the clink.
The title?
Interesting.
A new comedy. By Will Shakespeare!
And a share. We will be partners, Mr. Fennyman!
What's the title?
There's never any
Romeo and Ethel The Pirate's DaughterAlmost finished?
The theatres are all closed by the plague!
Mr. Shakespeare has given me the part of the Apothecary!
Do you know it?
Burbage offers me a partnership in the Chamberlain's Men. For fifty pounds my hired player days are over.
Will! Have you finished?
Nobody. The author.
By God, I wish I knew.
What is the story?
Romeo isItalian. Always in and out of love.
His best friend is killed in a duel by Ethel's brother or something. His name is Mercutio.
But at the playhouse. Nurse?
Playhouses are not for well-born ladies.
Your mother, and your father
I have seen you. You are the one who comes to all the plays--at Whitehall, at Richmond.
And--?
But playwrights teach nothing about love, they make it pretty, they make it comical, or they make it lust. They cannot make it true.
Your Majesty
When will you write me a sonnet, Will?
Mr. Pope! Mr. Phillips! Welcome, George Bryan! James Armitage!  Sam! My pretty one! Are you ready to fall in love again?
It is not my fault, Master Shakespeare. I could do it yesterday.
"The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars As daylight doth a lamp. Her eyes in heaven Would through the airy region stream so bright That birds would sing and think it were not night. See how she leans her cheek upon her hand. O that I were a glove upon that hand, That I might touch that cheek.
She will breed. If she do not, send her back.
As any mule in Christendom. But if you are the man to rider her, their are rubies in the saddlebag.
I have, Master Shakespeare.
Anon, good nurse. Anon.  Master Shakespeare?!
Oh but why "alas?"
Oh my lady, my love!
I would not have thought it. There is something better than a play.
Even your play.
You would not leave me?
Oh, do not go
"Good night, good night. As sweet repose and rest Come to thy heart as that within my breast. O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"
I found something in my sleep. The Friar who married them will take up their destinies.
You lie in your meadow as you lied in my bed.
Calf love. I loved the writer, and gave up the prize for a sonnet.
The Queen commands a comedy, Will for Twelfth Night.
An excellent beginning  Let him bea duke. And your heroine?
But fearful of her virtue, she comes to him dressed as a boy
I have spoken with your father.
How your mind hops about! Your father was a shopkeeper, your children will bear arms, and I will recover my fortune. That is the only matter under discussion today. You will like Virginia.
I meanYour Majesty, they do not, they have not, but I believe there is one who can
You look sad, my lady! Let me take you riding.
He is dead?
No, sir.
She tells me to keep away. She is to marry Lord Wessex. What should I do?
How do I offend, my lord?
Is there a man?
Do a little freebasemaybe, from time to time?
About this guy, this Hugo person.
I'm only asking what you think.
Only on expenses.
Family? Family? Friends? Drugged-up wandering suicidal search of the self fuck-ups don't have families, David.
Finished.
Listen, it's important. We need to talk about what we're going to do --
Doesn't it worry you?
Nothing.
Not eating what?
You looking for me?
Who?
It wasn't deep enough. I told you it wasn't deep enough, but you wouldn't listen.
Sex lines? Is that it? Triple X-rated interactive fantasy? Old habits die hard.
No, really, I am sorry, sorry to be ducking out on you like this. I hope you won't take it personally.
For the best. Exactly. I wouldn't want things to end on a downer.
Out in the woods. Three bodies. Decomposed. Mutilated. Beyond recognition.
I've never seen any of these men before.
Well, is it?
Parked outside?
Sorry to waste your time.
Well, Cameron, are you comfortable?
For my life? At a discussion group? I think not.
Who was it?
So we'll meet him, then?
Aroused and inflamed.
I'm not usually drunk.
David hasn't seen him either.
Hugo.
He's got a car?
Alex.
What are you doing?
No.The guy's dead.What more do you need?
No, Alex. It's, it's --
Whoever draws the short straw does it all. That way, you either do it or you don't. All or nothing.
Stop nagging.
Well, you certainly had a good look around.
I hope it tastes better than the other stuff.
You know we're right.
Exactly. Now I've been thinking --
Now you thought of that, not me.
Are you all right?
Stop him, Alex. You've got to stop him.
Good evening. I'm Detective Inspector McCall and this is DC Mitchell. I wonder if we could ask you some questions.
Two?
How strange. And how unsatisfactory to have misleading information. Only three people here. You're sure?
I see.
Is this what they always look like?
It's alright. I think he got the message anyway.
Yes.
Eh, I don't know.
What do we do here, David?
There's a whole wide world out there, and it all needs to be accounted for, doesn't it?
Oh, it's unfashionable, I know, but, yes, we're methodical, yes, we're dilligent, yes, we're serious, and where's the crime in that, and why not shout it from the rooftops, yes, maybe sometimes we are a little bit boring, but by God, we get the job done.
And that's why I think you fit in here.
Hello.
Would you like to come in?
I see.
Yes, the telephone, but if it's for me, I'm not in. HUGO You're not in.
It was some guy called Brian.
The human condition.
Take all the time you like, doctor.
No. I haven't seen them.
Chicken salad.
Don't you like her?
Maybe he's too flighty and irresponsible. That's why I asked if he was a fairy.
That's George.
-- yes, Senator -- just a minute, dear --
That girl's making an awful spectacle of herself.
I just thought you'd like to know --
-- is that what this is all about?
Whoever she is, she doesn't give up, does she?
Why not?
Nummers.
I can see that.
She's fine. You really think I'd be a good investment?
No, I know.
Hi.
Why didn't you come alone? Lester invited you. Did you have to bring her?
Sweetheart, it's a bore out there... let's lock the door.
That headboard.
How do you expect to get anything done if you allow yourself to get sidetracked? Particularly in your business... you deal with women every day...
Don't worry, honey, I'll protect you.
This is the one thing I like about this house... want some lox?
Did you hear me?
C'mon, are you or aren't you?
C'mon, tell me. Don't be afraid.
No kidding.
That you're just like your mother.
You're late, we're all backed up and you're supposed to go to Buffums.
I don't know. Probably not.
I'm sure.
Shut up, it's all right.  Do you want a drink?
Where do you want to do this?
George... how about Felicia?
Now, baby... if I told you about her... then you couldn't count on me not telling anymore... could you?
-- what guy?
-- gee...
No, I blew it, I blew it with Lester.
You don't think so? I do.
-- where'd you go?
-- ass and legs --
Well of course. Who loves a big fanny on a man?
-- last night I dreamt I was fifty years old and Mary told me I was supposed to meet Jill at the shop. It seared me shitless.
-- Jesus --
Why?
You're going to kill me.
What's too late about it? Look, we're not dead, are we? That's the only thing that's too late.
I can't just let him stand by the door...
Yeah!
-- you know better...
-- took a bus.
Nothing, my sister's back from Vegas.
Nothing, I reconciled with Ron, you know, the guy I divorced last summer.
Let me come, too.  Please don't leave me alone.
I don't know... every once in a while I just get the feeling something awful's going to happen.
Nobody's gonna get you. Now get inside.
Now, George --
How are you, baby?
Great, great, fantastic. Fantastic. Incredible. Incredible, really incredible.
I'm gonna open the shop, baby, I'm gonna open the shop. I'm getting it together.
I just came from a meeting... I can't talk about it now, baby. But in a few days -- see I'm disgusted with my life.
Maybe you don't even like children.
You've never even been around one.
George?
Not right now, I don't mean right now... but eventually...
George.
Jill, say hello to Felicia.
Jill says nothing.
Now, Jackie --
Let go of me or I'll scream, I'll call the police.
Baby, please don't... I love you.
-- yes.
What're you here for?
Felicia's really interested in the shop, isn't she?
When?
... she's very upset...
George, I know you have to deal with Felicia and you're caught in the middle, and if you can just bear with me tonight, well, I appreciate the way you've handled the situation.
It's a difficult situation, and I want you to know I appreciate it. Tonight's going to be real tough for me --
Well anyway...
Well -- I could try. Do you wash your hair every day?
This really ought to be layered...
Yeah, I'm unhappy with you about something.
Godammit, George...
Sit down.
Did they have something against me?
Why, why do you think that is?
Want a drink?
What took you so long?

Awww --


Oh, hi, I mean hello, we've met.
Well, yes, George is a wonderful hairdresser.
I go to the blue'n gold barber shop in Westwood. The guy in the third chair's dynamite... nobody much.
Who were you talking to?
Of course not.
George, glad you could make it, son. Hi, doll.
Hi, doll, what's wrong?
Jackie Shawn.
-- He reached up and tore them.
Well... I just kept wiping that dish. Maybe it doesn't sound very sexy but it was.
Sort of.
-- why?
-- so when are you going to Egypt?
What's wrong?
-- still -- at least we should tell him we're going. C'mon.
Thank you.
Do you have children?
Well we'd love to, but we're going to another party.
Dad?
There were a party of settlers in the covered wagon times.  They got snowbound one winter in the mountains.  They had to resort to cannabilism in order to stay alive.
Yes.
Are you sure?
Why don't you want to talk about it?
Who's Tony?
It's like I go to sleep, and he shows me things but when I wake up, I can't remember everything.
No, I'm scared of nothing here. It's just that you know some places are like people, some shine and some don't.  I guess you could say the Overlook Hotel here has something about it that's like shining.
Sure, Danny, it will be lots of fun.
The loser has to keep American clean, how's that?
Make sure you come right back, 'cause I'm going to make lunch soon. Okay?
Danny?
Mommy...
Now Danny, when you were brushing your teeth, do you remember if you smelled anything funny, or saw any bright flashing lights, or anything at all strange?
What's the next thing you remember after you were brushing your teeth?
Because he hides.
Shall we go into the living room?
Please...
Mrs. Torrance, I don't think you have anything to worry about.  I'm quite sure there is nothing physically wrong with Danny.
But eh what was the matter with him?
Tony.
How did he manage to do that?
That doesn't matter, sir.  You're the important one.
Won't keep you a moment, sir.
haven't I seen you somewhere before?
Ah ha, it's coming off now, sir.
Who?
How?
I fear that you will have to deal with this matter in the harshest possible way, Mr. Torrance.  I fear that is the only thing to do.
Good evening.  Forest Service.
Dick, if you're ready to do it now, I think it would be a good idea if you could show Mrs. Torrance the kitchen, while I continue on with Jack.
Beg pardon?
I did?
Bill, how do you do?
What'll it be?
How's my credit in this joint anyway?
Best goddamned bartender from Timbuctoo to Portland Maine - Portland Oregon for that matter.
Perfect for a child.
Well, something'll come.  It's just a matter of settling back into the habit of writing every day.
Did you find anything?
Well I... I think maybe he should be taken to a doctor.
Stay away from me!
Jack, stay away from me!
Wendy...
I'm gonna go now.
I'm Jack Torrance.
Only in a very general way.
...the winters can be fantastically cruel, and the basic idea is to...to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur.  And this consists mainly of running the boiler, heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis, repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs, so that the elements can't get a foothold.
can of itself be a problem.
been known to give a few people second thoughts about the job.
The police eh... they thought that it was what the old-timers used to call cabin-fever, a kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur when people are
This is the staff wing of the hotel. None of the other bedrooms are heated during the winter.
Thanks.
Hi.
Lowe's car-?
You always take his side because he's a cripple! Well, it's not my fault that he's a cripple!
Mom was really mad at him this time, wasn't she?
You booger.
Not bad, huh? My Uncle Al took off the regular muffler and put on a Cherry Bomb.
I used to see her every day, and she never knew what was going to happen to her, and neither did I! I mean I know how stupid that sounds, but...
Ralph Houk! You can't bet a manager! Stone the crows!
Mom-!
What's going on at Owen's, Uncle Al?
It isn't enough that the monster killed all those people- that he killed Brady. Now he's got them to cancel the fair.
It goes fast, all right- and if your mother finds out just how fast, Marty, I will have a new job. Singing soprano with the Vienna Boys' Choir.
What is it?
Thanks a million, Uncle Al!
Well... was it a prescription?
I saw what I saw.
Remember, Al... we'll be at the Ritz-Carlton in Boston tomorrow night! Or at the funeral parlor. It's Stickney and-
Reverend Mother, I just wanted to congratulate you.
He's... dreamy.  He's...
How are you doing.
Yeah, right to the cops.  No way.
I was good to you! You re nothing but no-talent garbage! You're a two-bit Tramp!
That machine.
What is it, Mary?
BUT THEN CAME AN ANGEL WHO WHISPERED THESE WORDS
Which convent?  It was, um, the Little Sisters... of the Moonlight.  In Vegas. Everybody used to come to Mass.  Frank. Dean.  Sammy.  Right at ringside.
Yeah, for one second.  That was the blend -- you've got to listen to each other.  Be a group.
Van Cartier.
So, Bob, how long have you been in? St. K's?
Oh. Mary Clarence, I'm so unworthy.  I want to take my final vows, I would do it tomorrow, but Reverend Mother won't let me!
Well, then there's only one thing to do.
Who are all these people?
Mary Clarence!  You're so... different from the other sisters.  Sometimes, well... sometimes you sound more like a layperson.
Mary Clarence!
What was all that?  Who was that man? Why would he shoot at us?
What?
Are you leaving us?
That's my real name!  Currently I'm a singer.  Sort of.
Sit down.
How about a robe?  One of those big terry cloth jobs, with like embroidery on the pocket.  "Guest of St. Katherine's"
It never solves anything.
Really catching on.
So... hi there.
Mary Robert's life was in danger! Your behavior was inexcusable!
Exactly.  People like going to theaters and casinos.  But they think church is for Grandma -- we could change that. Pack the joint.
And on such an occasion, I feel a completely traditional program will be best.
What?
You saved my life.
Really?  And maybe shorter habits, and women priests, and sleeping late?
All right!  I get the picture!  I'll do it!  I'll testify!
Eddie, you've got to get me out of here.
But I'm going insane!  All these people do is pray and work, work and pray!  I don't get it -- when's the weekend? They have gruel, Eddie, that's what they call food!  Gruel -- it's like Alpo for nuns! I sleep in a cell, on a board, and I pray five times a days  Do you know what I pray for, Eddie, do you have any idea? Check your crotch, Eddie --anything fall off yet?  Get me outta her!
Eddie!  You scared the hell out of me!
I am?
Well..  thanks.  I've been thinking about you.. - sometimes.  I mean, there aren't a lot of guys around here.  I mean, sometimes I feel like... a nun.
Vince knows you're here.
Don't you have a concert to go to?
Yeah, Eddie, thanks a whole bunch. Thanks for sticking me in a convent.  So you think, after all this, maybe I really am a nun?
Hey, girls.
He's so damn cocky.  This is different.
But, boss -- she's still, you know, a nun.
She's gettin' away!
Are you going to shoot us all, tough guy?
She shouldn't have come back.  She knew she was in danger.
We did it!  We actually sang a chord!
You mean -- they kidnapped her?
Well, I don't care who she is.  We can't sing without her!
Excuse me -- has anyone seen a nun?
Mary Clarence -- you're alive!
Reverend Mother?
I lied.
She's a nun, Vince.
Constable Crane is not the only one who fights with science on his side.
An honor, gentlemen.  In time I will need every detail of the three murderings you've had, but, for now, I ask only if you have any theory at all as to who the killer might be?
We must be a curious sight to him.
Keep still, Constable.  You were half-drowned when they found you.
You are so upset now... and yet, you seemed in such good spirits last night.
Taken.  Taken by the Headless Horseman.  Taken back to hell.
May we look at them now?
Our first night watch is adequate against fire and some violence, but if we were more often able to ensure justice, after the fact, then criminals would truly have something to fear from law enforcement.
Without disrespect, look around you.  We overflow.  As do our courts.
For one who calls himself a Federalist, your mouth reeks of Republican liberalism.
Just so.  Granted.  And so you take your experimentations to Sleepy Hollow and catch the murderer who has tainted the place.  Bring him here to face our good justice. Will you do this for me?
Master Crane, sir.  I'm glad we have time alone.  You've been told plenty about the Horseman, I'm certain.
The Lenape Indian had much to tell once I opened his mouth.
Where are we going?
Out there.  What do you see?
What is it?
I hear nothing.
Well... I'm one of the few people who likes you.
My father had farm land.  It was the only thing we owned of any value.
Only the heirs were killed.  Proof that the Horseman slaughters by assignment.
Did your father take a loan?
There are no other doors.  This is as far as she could have gone.
This is farewell.
Climb up!
What now?
Did they tell?  It is something in the air so that dreams come to everyone.  According to the elders, an Indian prophet held powwows here before the land was taken, and spells cast then still linger to this day.
Well, I intended to apologize for the behavior of my friend Brom Van Brunt, but it seems I've made matters worse.  I'll leave you to your business.
He has proposed to me twice.
Really?  Then... what is your rebuttal to those romantic poets claiming proof of magic in a rose at full bloom, or even in a teardrop?
Thank you.  No.  Here...
Why would you do such a thing?
What are you on about?
What is it then?  Scientific method? How can any of this matter in the slightest?
Lady Van Tassel... she is your stepmother, isn't she?  She bears so little resemblance.
It is only me.
What... what are you doing... ?
Yes, I have seen that, and I told you why I hid them.
Katrina...
Lay still, Ichabod.  Do not move.
You do not want to be here.  Go home to your father.
She is guilty.
She has confessed.
Yeah, they's good all right.
They give me fifty dollars when they turned me loose. I spent up some of it on ridin' the bus and eatin' french-fried potaters.
Thank ye.
Aw, pretty good. Kids are drivin' me crazy and Phyliss is gonna put me in the poorhouse. Can't complain other than that. Wouldn't do any good if I did.  Do you know Scooter, Jerry?
Don't look much like he could. You say he can fix a small engine like nobody's bidness.
Karl, come over here. I want you to meet your new boss.  This is Bill Cox, runs this place. Says you can work here and stay in the back.
Did you decide, sir?
French fries. I like to eat them pretty good.
I got a mama, but she's at work over at Ben's Dollar Store. My daddy's dead.  He got hit by a train.
Well, it's not too big in here, is it?  I feel very generous today. I feel like listening. I'm sure you have plenty to tell me. And please bore me with the details.  ) Come on Karl, who did you kill? Was it the boy?
Well, I wouldn't let it get to you.
Who could eat with him settin' there makin' that goddamn racket with his throat.
He don't want to Doyle. Don't go Vaughan if you don't want to. You'll wreck Doyle, you're drunk.
Leave.
You like that Vaughan?
Are you sure you can drive? You've really had a lot of alcohol.
You got that shit right.
What are all them books?
How come you're carryin' them around with you.
They let you out?
Are you well?
They still around, your folks?
Well, I hate him.
I don't see how you can eat that stuff with all those insides it's made out of.
Boy, folks sure had it rough back a long time ago, didn't they?
You know that girl I told you about. The one I love.
I usually get run off by her mama or daddy if they're home. Reckon why they don't like me?
And I don't try to touch her. You know, in a bad way. Foolin' around, sex and all.
So it died when it come out?
Seems like Doyle's wormed his way back in. Mama said he's stayin' over tonight and he's talkin' about movin' in for good. We ain't ever gonna be happy. We'll always be nervous, won't we Karl?
I feel sad about Karen Cross, too. I just make like to myself she loves me. I know better, though. It just feels good to me when I imagine it.
Bill Cox is goin' to a funeral for a Mister Turner tomorrow and a closin' up shop early.
Yeah.
Hey, Karl. How'd you know to come out here?
I know he does.
Well, at least he's tryin'. But who knows for how long.
Yes ma'am, I reckon.
I ain't got nothing but them books.
I know, I've seen it myself. Would you give that a try?
She's talkin' about me, Karl. That's my first name.
Karl, you up?
Two fellers was on a bridge a takin' a leak and one feller says the water was cold and the other said it was deep water. One of 'em came from Arkansas, I believe.
We sure like havin' you.
I don't think I've ever seen you before.
It's been here seventeen years. Did you live here before or something?
What brings you back?
Do you have family here?
Well that's a very offensive way to put it. You shouldn't say that. You were taught that, weren't you?
Anyway, it's hard to live gay, that's the right way to say it, in a small town like this. I've wanted to leave many times, but my love for Linda and Frank and another certain person that we won't go into have kept me from it. Anyway, I'm rambling. If you're going to live in the Wheatly garage you need to know that it won't be easy. Doyle is a monster. Not just a closed minded redneck, but a monster. A dangerous person. I've told Linda that one day that man is going to really hurt her or that boy. Maybe even kill one of them. I see it in his eyes. I'm very in tune, maybe even psychic. Doyle will make your life hell. You're a perfect target. When I first saw you I was afraid of you. Not really afraid, I guess, just taken aback. But also, I felt a real sensitive feeling from you. And for some reason, Frank has adopted you. Much like a stray animal. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that. In a good way. Anyway, I just want you to know what you're in for. I have a good feeling about you. You're good for Frank. Maybe it's that he can have an adult friend on a child's level. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it in a bad way.  There's one more thing. It's none of my business why you were in the state hospital. Everyone has something in their past, maybe you tried suicide, maybe you did something -- terrible. But what I see before me is a gentle, simple man. All I want you to promise me is that you're capable of being around Linda and Frank. You know. You would never hurt them under any circumstances, would you?
I think Karl is going to be a writer or a librarian eventually. You should see all the books he has. He must read constantly.
What's wrong? Is everything okay?
What about you, Karl? Do you want to stay here?
Are you sure it's safe to let him around that guy?
Good. I haven't decided yet if I'm a good cook.
Listen everybody, I know this may sound corny, I've had a few glasses of wine and that kind of makes me a little emotional, but I'm going to say it anyway. It just came over me in a rush. I want you all to know that I care about each and every one of you at this table.
My name's Jerry Woolridge.
Karl's real sensitive about having his picture made. He wouldn't even be on the bulletin board for the Easter Collage.  Melvin, would you get me a good hot cup with two sugar substitutes? You girls want some coffee?
But, here's the thing. He'll only talk to you. He doesn't want you to ask him anything. And you shouldn't stare at him.
Is he leaving right this minute?
Yes.
It's coming along. At the rate he's going, he'll have a story finished by the end of the summer.
Ah-hah, I see. A cozy dinner. But aren't threesomes a little awkward? How does the phrase go--
And what are you, his chaperone?
I thought I recognized you. You're Paul Benjamin the writer, aren't you?
Your dissertation? What subject do you study?
What else. Of course, what else? And what are you writing about for your thesis?
Melville, huh?  It's been a while.
Not an easy book.
It's been a while. I thought maybe you'd be in touch.
Uh ... actually, it might be better if you read the story first. Call me when you're finished, okay?
Do me a favor, will you?
It's simpler, that's what. It makes things go faster.
Looks like someone forgot a camera.
A photographer ...
Yeah. There she is. She's in quite a few from that year. She must have been on her way to work.
The kid's sorry, Auggie.
It could have been worse. If the cops hadn't come, I might not be standing here now.
It's not a long drive. An hour, an hour and a half. We'll be back in time for dinner.
What do you mean?
And you think it looks better to go around dressed up like Captain Hook?
Help, huh? And I don't suppose this help has anything to do with money, does it?
Yeah, well, I lost my pen. By the time I got a new one, I was clean out of paper.
Good old Frank. And how is fat Mr. Grease Monkey these days?
Nice try, old girl. I'd like to help you out. You know, for old time's sake. But all my spare cash is tied up in a business venture, and I haven't collected my profits yet. Too bad. You caught me at the wrong time.
That I wasn't bullshitting you, sweetheart. At least you'll know I've been telling the truth.
Wait till you see her, Auggie.
She's just a kid. There's time for more babies later. After she grows up.
Fuck this angel shit. Just take the dough, Ruby. But no bawling, okay? I can't stand people who blubber.
Shit. You should have been married to someone by now. You know, settled down somewhere with a kid or two, a nice steady job.
Lovely.
You don't take anything seriously, do you?
No thanks. I don't care what you do, but just make sure you don't get caught, okay? The last I heard, it was still illegal to sell Cuban cigars in this country.
Seventeen.
Definitely. I'd say you've hit the nail on the head.
It's for you.
It'll never be finished.
Seventy-eight dollars. The girl who rolled these was probably wearing panties.
It'll keep them fresh. If they get too dry, they'll break. And you don't want that to happen, do you?  Tobacco is a plant, and it needs the same loving care you'd give an orchid.
Don't give me any of that. I know he's been here. You can't fool me, mister.
I just want to know where he is.
He goes to John Jay High School in Brooklyn.
Which brings me back to my original question. What was he doing here in the first place?
Well, one thing I suppose, but I don't think it has anything to do with this.  A friend of mine called about two weeks ago and said she'd spotted Thomas's father working at some gas station outside of Peekskill.
You going to sit here all day?
Just passing through. A lonesome traveler with a knapsack on his back plops himself across from my garage to admire the view. There's other places to roam, kid, that's all I'm saying. You don't want to make a nuisance of yourself.
It's rundown, all right. But drawing a picture won't improve the way it looks.  Let's see what you did, Rembrandt.
Do you have eyes in your head, or are those brown things bulging out of your sockets just marbles? You've been sitting here all day, and how many cars have you seen drive up and ask for gas?
Not a one. Not one customer all day. I bought this broken-down shit-hole of a place three weeks ago, and if business don't pick up soon, I'm going straight down the skids. What do I want to be hiring someone for? I can't even pay my own wages.
I'll tell you what. You want to work. I'll give you a job. Nothing permanent, mind you, but that upstairs room over there  -- the one above the office -- is a hell of a mess. It looks like they've been throwing junk in there for twenty years, and it's time it got cleaned up.
Benefits?
And have you mended them?
It's only temporary. On a freelance basis.
Hi there, little brother.
That's funny. His name is the same as yours.
Thomas Cole. My name is Thomas Jefferson Cole.
Yeah? Who is it?
Well?
No harm done. Everything's okay now.  I've got to be going.
That's all right. If I think of something, I'll send my butler over to tell you.
Yeah, sure, and I bet you had lobster last night. Along with two bottles of champagne.
You don't know me from a hole in the wall.
East Seventy-fourth Street.
People don't do that kind of thing. Not in New York.
I listen on the radio. I can see the games just fine that way.  The world is in your head, remember?
It's strange, though, isn't it? Looking at yourself before you knew who you were.
No, he was a schoolteacher. But he liked to dabble.
Time to wake up.  Hey, kid, time to wake up.  Rashid!  Up and out. I have to work in here. The slumber party is over.
A little less clumsiness around here would be nice, don't you think?
Two or three nights.
I'm sorry I messed up. You've been very kind to me ...  But all good things have to come to an end, right?
Where the hell do you think you're going?
That's because we don't belong anywhere. You don't fit into your world, and I don't fit into mine. We're the outcasts of the universe.
Let's not get too idealistic.
Thanks.
I don't know. Two or three. It was pretty late.
If you don't sleep, you don't dream. If you don't dream, you don't have nightmares.
Okay, just a little hint. I can't tell you the story, but I'll tell you what gave me the idea for it.
Yeah, right. The inspiration. It's a true story anyway, so I don't suppose it can hurt, can it?
Celebrate? What for?
Yes, an invitation. I apologize for springing it on you at the last minute, but Mr. Benjamin and I are attending a celebration tonight, and we would be most pleased if you chose to accompany us.  Isn't that right, Mr. Benjamin?
His only copy.  I mean, if you think you're going to die, what's more important, a good book or a good smoke? And so he huffed and he puffed, and little by little he smoked his book.
Good thinking.
You have one hell of a knack for getting into trouble, don't you?  So how much does it come to?
So you robbed the robbers, and now the robbers are after you.
Yeah, well, you have to be nuts to do what you did. If you want my opinion, you should give this money back to the Creeper. Just give it back and tell him you're sorry.
So you lost the job. Is that what you're telling me? He just up and fired you?
Cuban cigars. You mean he had some hanky-panky going with those guys?
I'm serious, all right. You've got to square it with Auggie. Since you won't give the money back to the Creeper, you can use it to make things right with Auggie. That's probably better anyway. Better to keep your friends than to worry about your enemies.
If it doesn't make any difference, why not just say it?
Yeah, give him another one. And I'll take a cup of coffee while you're at it.
Seven acres.  I'm wonderin' what you'd pay for 'em.  Just curious, is all.
The battery's in, that's done with.  Besides, you'd do the same for m...
So the blood on the gaff was not fish blood at all.  It was <u>human</u>, yes?  Type B positive.
Bits of blood and wood.  What else would there be?
I don't know.
With no bone or scalp or hair present.  Would it be more probable that the blood came from crushing a man's skull...
Him and his folks and two brothers and two sisters worked our land. Lived in a picker's cabin at first.
Now defendant's father had also died by that point.  Where was the defendant?  When you sent his family their equity.
It is.
So the fishing gaff method wouldn't make sense?
Closer to eight.
Yes, and then, what was there to call about?  Everything was up in the air.
We discussed that.  And decided not to.
Did you write that column?
And you weren't there, when the coroner examined the wound.
From Carl Heine's boat.  All his were like this one, three-strand manila, new condition, braided in loops.  Not bowlined like Miyamoto's.
So if defendant had tied up to deceased's boat.  With that last one.  Would those cleats have lined up?
As peculiar as a struggle between a 235 pound man, and an assailant strong enough to subdue him...that leaves only a <u>single</u> overturned <u>cup</u> in its wake?
You're a hard man to trust, sir. You sit before us, with no expression, keeping a poker f...
Maybe it went.  Where Carl went. Over the side.
Then putting them together.  So truth is revealed.
And then your stroke came this summer.  And you put your property on the market, I believe you said September 7.  Which, remember, is <u>eight</u> days before Carl Heine died. And who comes Spetember 7, wanting to buy?
I should have told everything right away.  I know that now, and I regret it.
They got transferred that day. Out to Cape Flattery.
I did.  Boy.
You think so?
Cigarette?
We don't let go, you s...
See you replaced a mooring line, lately.  This one's new.
So every time you think about showing that jury strength.  Or honor or composure.  Or dignity.
Does it now?
Now I did some measuring down at the chandlery.  A D-6 is one inch wider than a D-8.  It would be too large for the deceased's well.
No spare.
Operating this winch you'd rarely operated before, doing this awkward job of bringing in a drowned man of 235 pounds...is it <u>possible</u>.  Possible that he struck his head <u>after</u> death. Possible?
What else could it be?
In your motorcycle example.  Those injuries are produced by the head being propelled <u>against</u> an object. Rather than the reverse, yes?
For certain, no.
So your husband said he's think it over.  Encouraged Mr. Miyamoto to believe he might sell to h...
Those 'dirty looks'.  Defendant ever aim one of those at you?
...He used to say, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
Melton, on the double!  Up a chain!                                   MELTON  Sir!     MELTON takes a few easy strides, gracefully catches a chain mid- stride, and smarts up, climbing easily and twice as fast as TODD.     CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK crane their necks as the two men struggle upward toward the rafters.     Three quarters of the way up, MELTON comes even with TODD, then passes him. MEKUM, watching, smirks.     CHURCH is watching too, and he's still not satisfied.  His brow is knit, something's bothering him.     ANGLE HIGH ABOVE, AMONG THE GIRDERS     Stonefaced, MELTON is resting an a "platform" on the chain, sixty feet up, beneath the girders, swaying gently.     His stony gaze is on the next chain where TODD is arriving at a "platform" on an adjacent chain...only three feet away.     Their eyes meet, TODD and MELTON alone together sixty feet up, three feet apart.  Neither man blinks, neither man flinches, neither man reveals anything at all...     LOW ANGLE, LOOKING UP     CHURCH considers the men high above, then to MEKUM.                                   CHURCH                    What about...spirit?
Yes, Sue?  What is it?
You're in Berths 7 and 7A.
Upsy-daisy.
No --- how does it go?
You girls have seen a brown bag with a white stripe and my initials?
Okay.
Because I lost a filling in my back tooth. I gotta go to the dentist tomorrow.
It's just a little inlay - it doesn't even have to be gold -
First thing tomorrow we're going to pay everybody a little something on account.
But suppose it doesn't?
It did?  Boy, did it ever!
Right.  We have the same blood type...
We didn't see anything -  - did we?
You'd better go fix it.
But suppose I lose?  Suppose it's an emergency?
How can we?  We're broke.
Fat chance!  You call him right back and tell him I'm not going.
You're going to be on the boat with that dirty old man?
With ME?
What happened?
Jerry!  You can't be serious!
I'll say there is!
Oh.
Jerry, listen to me - there are laws - conventions - it's just not being done!
That's some nerve!
It's just going to break his heart when he finds out I can't marry him.
Joe, if we get out of this hotel alive, you know what we're going to do? We're going to sell the bracelet, and grab a boat to South America and hide out in one of those banana republics -  The way I figure is, if we eat nothing but bananas, we can live there for fifty years - maybe a hundred years - that is, if we get out of the hotel alive.  Did we forget anything?
Sugar?
Since when?  Usually you leave 'em with nothing but a kick in the teeth.
I don't know about the captain - but the navigator is getting his tail out of here.
What'll I tell him?
That's us.  I'm Daphne - and this is Josephine.
We'll take a rain check.
It's nothing.  I just think us girls should stick together.
I'd better stay here till she goes back to sleep.
You all right?
I tell you - this is the only way to travel.
No - no lights.  We don't want anyone to know we're having a party.
So spill it.  Spills, thrills, laughs, games - this may even turn out to be a surprise party.
Uh-uh.  Not yet.
I'll carry the instruments.
Oh, please do come.  Don't disappoint us. It'll be such fun.  And bring your yacht.
Sugar, dear - let me give you some advice. If I were a girl - and I am - I'd watch my step.
No!
I thought I heard voices - and I just had to talk to somebody.  I don't feel like going to sleep.
How did those holes get there?
It's about the Florida job.
What's wrong with us?
I am Osgood Fielding the Third.
Goodbye, Mr. Fielding.
I called Mama - she was so happy she cried - she wants you to have her wedding gown - it's white lace.
We'll adopt some.
The New Caledonia.  That's the name of it.  The Old Caledonia went down during a wild party off Cape Hatteras.  But tell her not to worry - this is going to be a quiet little midnight snack - just the two of us.
I don't like no witnesses.
Anything today?
You're making it up pretty good so far.
What's the job?
And you'll be in all evening?
Good!  Then you won't be needing your car.
Hey, Sig - can we talk to you?
The wrong shape?  You looking for hunchbacks or something?
Hey, Sheboygan - you two - what was your last job - playing square dances?
We got time off for good behavior.
On the Baltimore and Ohio.
Then why did you take this job?
Bingo?
Really?
Yeah.
Brains aren't everything.
Men who wear glasses are so much more gentle and sweet and helpless. Haven't you ever noticed?
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
That must be it.
How's the stock market?
No - the ukulele.  And I sing.
Yeah.  Real hot.
- opening of the Opera -
- and always the same Four Hundred.
Maybe I'll tell you when I know you a little better.  What are you doing tonight?
Oh?
And you will come to hear us tonight?
Oh, I'm not going to let this one get away. He's so cute - collects shells.
I guess he's not going to show up - it's give minutes to one - you suppose he forgot?
You heard her - yes.
I just got this motorboat - it's an experimental model.
My dad is more interested in railroads. Baltimore and Ohio.  Which is the port and which is the starboard?
Oh, you have an upstairs and a downstairs.
What is it?
Water polo - isn't that terribly dangerous?
Where's your shell collection?
See?  Nothing.
Yes.  Eight hours later they brought her up by mule - I gave her three transfusions - we had the same blood type - Type O - it was too late.
Ever since then -  numb - no feelings.  Like my heart was shot full of novocaine.
Is that anything?
Don't talk like that.  I'm sure there must be some girl some place that could -
You're not giving yourself a chance. Don't fight it.  Relax.
I never knew it could be like this.
Where did you learn to kiss like that?
Good night.
Gee, I wish I'd been there.
Real diamonds.  They must be worth their weight in gold.  Are you always this generous?
Oh.  The navigator just came in - we're ready to cast off.
You'll forget him, Sugar.
Sugar!  What do you think you're doing?
I don't believe I've seen you at any of our services before.
You'll like it there.  I'll have the prison tailor fit you with a pair of special spats - striped!
Embalming people with coffee - eighty-six proof.
You're wasting the taxpayers' money.
Look, Chief - I better blow now, because if Spats Colombo sees me, it's Goodbye Charlie.
We thought you was all broken up about Toothpick Charlie.
Hello, Charlie.  Long time no see.
Christ, Amy.
Do you want to come in for a minute? We could talk about--
You know all that if these walls could talk stuff? Do you believe it? That a place has a memory?
If Ed ever found out....
Say something. Please.
Wheres Nick sleeping?
She blames Tony Pee-Pants Pinterello for everything. The fall of the British Empire, the Cold War, the internet.
Before Tony, you and your sister were best friends. I couldnt split you up. If your sister ate the spinach, you ate the spinach. If you threw up--.
I think I love you, mate.  How do you know so much about so much?
Theres something about him thats just a bit odd.
I didnt deserve her back then.
Nothing, nothing.
Kat, wait. I dont want you hating me. Weve never had this talk. You know how crap I am at this.
Hi. Hey.
The Knicks game? We both wanted the last hot dog?
What did he say exactly? I mean, you dont think he wants me back?
That wont be an issue, believe me. I find the idea of sex for money morally repugnant.  No offense.
You quitting?
Sorry. Im a little nervous. I never thought something like this would happen to me.
Would you grab my shampoo?
So...what was I...oh, yeah. Do you honestly think that I want to be single and miserable? That I want to be obsessed with some asshole who led me on for years then -- out of the blue -- shattered my heart.
Are you asking me if Im gay for pay?
Its hard to explain.
Come on.
Are you sure?
Is this for last night?
So youre telling me. If something had happened last night...it would have cost me fourteen hundred dollars? Thats a down payment on a Ford Focus!
Hello, goodbye, I want you, I hate you. Its all just words. None of it means anything. What matters is what you do. You either stay put or you walk away. If you look back, youre not walking away!
Im sorry I was such a bitch. I really appreciate your doing this.
There was something in your voice on the phone that day.
And thats when he peed in his pants? After the tart?
Youre right. I was so desperate to make everyone believe I was happy that I spent six grand on a lie. And after all that? The only one who ended up falling for it was me.
You didnt have to do that.
Thats not true. We checked for leaks a few years back.  Good morning.
I always wondered what happened with us.
I am now, sir.
What is it you do again?
What do you say to that?
Hey, Sigmund, you think you could rustle up the bride and tell her to join the party?
Well, how did you like the class, David?
Oh... . You right, that's all that was worryin' me right then...
But you did all you could, David. Not many little boys could've gone on such a journey as you did.
And so you did your job, right?
Whewwww! You sure keep my mind jumping, boy!
How was your sister after you pulled her out of the water?
Clarence, would you tell us a story that was not true, after telling us it was?
I can't do it, Rita -- that's the policy here on colored prisoners, and I ain't about to change it, not even for a friend like you.
Don't tell me about what's wrong. You come into my office as a friend and steal city files! I could have you arrested for that -- and if you give out that information to anybody, that's exactly what I'm going to do -- and I'll tell everybody in this town how you got the information and who you got it for! You won't have a friend left in this county to bring you a piece of candy!
There ain't no possums in this woods tonight, Daddy.
Yes, sir...
You learnin' anything at that school?
Do you think he's dead, Daddy?
It's a shame they won't let 'em come in here. If I had the strength I'd knock down these damn walls -- if I could just git my arms 'round your mama right now -- is they on this side of us, son?
What's wrong with your leg, Daddy?
Son, that was some trip you went on...
Daddy, you home now... that's all I want -- I don't want nothin' else...
Mornin', son...
From Miss Johnson --
I won't go, Daddy! I won't go!
David, you never cease to amaze me at how good you are in taking care of my garden.
Miss Boatwright --
See you tomorrow, Miss Boatwright.
He eats all right -- his throat ain't scarred.
Where did it come from, Mama?
What do they do in the white churches, Mama?
'Bye, Mama...
Can't sleep?
So did I. I figured when the time got right, we could all take a day or two and walk up there, but it's not the kind of long trip for a child to take alone.
Can I go day after tomorrow?
Didn't see 'im, Mama. The other men there say they didn't know Daddy.
So when I left, she gave me these books.
What's wrong, Nathan?
Be good and be smart, little boy.
But I saw you -- you looked in there, and you found out, Miss Boatwright.
Don't pout now, David, it's a long trip.
Hello, David...
If they heard me sing like this up North I'd be richer than the man I sharecrop for.
You know, one time by mistake I went into a white church down in Row County and to this day I don't know how'n the devil I got outta that church alive.
I guess so -- but I went home and did me some praying to the Lord. I said, Lord, I went into this white church down in Row and all I want you to tell me is how I ever got outta there in one piece.
Don't take all day at that table, David Lee.
Mama, why did they take Daddy away?
The boy done went into my walnuts! I skin my fingers to the bone to pick two pounds that's worth almost nothing at the commissary and he done took almost half of what I pick!
We been through these off-seasons before -- we made it.
You ready to eat?
What did he want?
That's the way they do things here in Landsdown. I just follow orders.
I'd like to help you, Rebecca. But all that would do, is git us both in trouble.
Patient 453 here has been fitted with the new v-chip...
Fuckin' a right.
To free Terrance and Phillip.
What is this?
Fuck that!  AGAGH!!
How come Terrance and Phillip are so weird looking?
I bet him he couldn't do it... I bet him a hundred dollars!
Come on, just get to the message board!
You're late, Cartman!
Did you bring the pie and punch?
Mph rmpmh rm.
Eric!  Don't talk to Ms. Brovlofski that way!
Mom...
Oh you poor dear. You've been through so much...
You've got a stupid accent too.
Ha! Is the Pope Catholic?
What's going on, Chef?
May I?
WE'RE going! WE started La Resistance to save Terrance and Phillip! We're going!
What are you doing?! Get on with your misery!
Him? I don't know... He can be nice... sometimes.
What do you mean?! I could leave him if I wanted to!
Hey, relax Satan. Don't get all worked up. You're gonna give yourself an ulcer again.
What's the password?
That's gonna take a long time!
Dude, we don't have watches.
Now listen carefully. Stan and Kyle, you stand watch here and await my return. If any guards come by, make a sound like a dying giraffe.
Be careful, dude.
It's so very cold...
That was sweet!
Now remember, don't tell anybody we saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!
What? What don't I get?  What don't I get?
This is sweet!!
It's only a matter of time before my mom has HIM burned too!
I don't know. But it has gone far enough! I'm sick of it!  <b>Something must be done! Change has got to come around! They're taking all our laughter and burning it to the ground! Can't you see what this is leading to? A world of chains and ties and glue! We have to fight before they've taken every one! Something must be done!</b>
Oh, brother.
I knew this would happen! Those bastard Canadians have now killed a child! Can't people see the damage that film is doing?!
Sheila, you're going to far! Those are YOUR children!
Ma'am, we're tracking a resistance... It's probably Canadian spies!!
Terrance and Phillip MOVIE?! Oy gevalt! Not again!
Article 42!  You don't mean-?!
Uh, we're just, starting our program...
How is the children's progress?
What do you mean MOST, why not ALL?
Mrs. Brovlofski, the V-chip hasn't been fully tested yet, it could be dangerous.
Well, fuck my ass and call me a bitch, I just got a letter!
You'd fuck your uncle!
Well, Terrance I hope you learned something from this whole experience.
HA HA HA! You burned yourself to death by lighting the fart! HA HA HA!!
Oh, Phillip.  This cannot be good.
You just get cranky when you're tired, that's all.  I told you that you shouldn't have tried to carry that futon all by yourself.
It has come to be...  The Four Horsemen are drawing nigh!  The time of the prophecy is upon us!
<b>What if I, don't wanna put out? That's all you ever say Relax put out I'm a living creature, I have feelings too, I don't need this abuse from you-</b>
Hey, I'm missing the party!
I TOLD you not to make that deal, Saddam!
Wendy?
No, dude. Fuck him. Fuck him in the ear.
Jesus, come on!
Excuse me?
Well, so we are.  Sure is beautiful, huh?
Weren't you down in the dining room?
On channel 10?
I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.
I think I can handle it.
If anyone can hear me please respond!
I don't know what you're talking about!
Barnes?
Well if you knew it then why did set your thrusters on before making the calculation?
Is that clear?
So you were looking for a new challenge.
Well, let me put it this way.  Most of the cost is due to safety reasons. Most people are not familiar with space travel, so we have to take extra precautions in the event they do something careless.
Well I don't think there's a chance of that happening.  It's usually the moon walks.  Sometimes you feel like a kindergarten teacher.
Really?
We don't.
Supposing we could get out of this room?  Is there anything we could do to reach the bridge?
Sure. It complies with all standard construction codes.
And suppose you couldn't hold out?
We could send Mac.  If he can retrieve one suit, we could go back for the other.
He certainly is polite.
Are you ready?
You're ready for the real thing?
Explosive?
A little dab'll do ya. Now you know how to get there, right?
But how are you going to escape?
Dawn.  Come in.
He's out of the equation.  Talk to me.
So close...
Will you marry me?
I would, but no one can perform the ceremony.  I guess it doesn't matter.
In that case, I accept.
Thank you.
What is happening around here!!!
I'm going back for Taylor!
Look around you baby, we're rubbing elbows with royalty, oil sheiks, this is class.  You'll be envied by everyone.
You're Delbert Miles!  You have more clout than some whacked out pilot!  Talk to him!
You're gonna give him those bank codes, you know why?  Because I'm telling you to, that's why.  I'm not losing my life over some greedy pig.
I tell you, something's not right here.  How do we know they're not going to use the pod for themselves?
What the hell is that?
Mac, I have a favor to ask you. Mac looks at Taylor -
Yeah but the ship's mainframe doesn't. I need you to tell it something.
You a mini-golfer?
Hey, cut it out Sid, that tickles. I'm serious! You guys are related, right?
Hey, ain't I seen you on the tour?
How do you turn this thing off?
Bowling police, step back, give him room.
Buzz Burger, side of 'cues. You haven't introduced me to your fan.
Miles, I've always been on the square with you.
What do you think I can do?
Orange whip, nectar of the bowling gods. Thanks sweetie. Millie turns the tray so that Buzz takes the untainted whip.  Theo takes the other glass.
You're a bullshit artist, that's what you are. You got no right to be here! Theo yanks the trophy away from Buzz.
Millie left to stay with her sister in Ronkonkoma.
What are you doing over at the lanes that's so dangerous, Buzz?
She thinks someone's trying to kill you.
It's the next level, the next dimension...  ...the small ball.
It's gonna be bigger than big. Think Europe. Think Asia. They don't have room for real golf courses in Japan.
What the fuck is this?
We ain't married no more.
You give Ed Klein of the American Bowling Congress a call.  Tell him your Maynard's boy. He's expecting you, and he owes me. He'll getcha back in like Flynn.  Don't say I never gave you nothing.
Oh sure. Let everyone in. From now on I leave the door wide open. Let the parade begin!
He's the guy Buzz.
I don't like to talk about it.
No, Junior, you shouldn't touch her.
We're having a party for you, boy. Cake and shish-k-bob, just like you love. Junior cringes away from the light.
Hey, enough fun and games. We have work to do. Come on Junior. Kastle heads for his car. Junior gets up and follows. The two sleazeballs tarry as Theo stands.
So you're Buzz's boy. I've been expecting you. You hurt my feelings when you didn't come and see me sooner.
That's some pinfall. Almost a 133 average. Her ball's flat, she needs to work on her spin control.
Think of this business like a big aquarium. You gotta have some sharks to eat the dirt at the bottom so the guppies can swim free at the top.
You already have a partner Mr. Kastle. Sheila walks over as the sleazeballs' car pulls out of the driveway.
Dad, this is ridiculous. Just open it.
You're using Theo for your own deviant purposes!
Fantastic! What talent.
132, 154.
I get them while they're young. Builds loyalty.
Is Mr. Fazeli in please?
This is a sign! Someone's coming to take Buzz away from me. I don't know if you're the guy or what, but I'm not letting it happen. I'm leaving him first.
This is a vicious cycle.
What does he do?
Mind if I cut in?
So this brother of yours is hazardous to the health of your dates?
So you're hoping Buzz can get you re- instated?
Ha! And what do you have to do for him?
Come on, bargain with me.
You professional men drive a hard bargain. I'm afraid I only have five on me. Sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill.
I'm sure you wouldn't care if he needed your help, right?
Yeah, what did Buzz Fazeli ever do for you?
I saw your eyes when you hit that guy with your ball on TV. THUNDER rumbles. Theo takes Sheila by the shoulders.
You wanted me to kill him, didn't you?
Can I come with you?
Why did you come back?
Say something, Theo. Give me something. A doll's legs catch fire. Theo stares into Sheila's eyes.
Theo, Buzz is dead.
Sez you!
Very professional.
Lips still for sale?
You drag that coconut around for your health, or do you know how to use it?
You guys got something going on downstairs?
Aagh! Stop! Those are my bowling fingers!
You faked my dad's murder. You used him! Where is he! Theo chases Sid and Breeze around their car. He catches Sid and grabs the middle fingers on his right hand. Sid howls.
Let me out, Captain.  Open the door!
... Your civil rights have been overridden!
Fletcher?  What are you doing out there?
Get out of there!
There's heat coming the door.
Alright, Beth, do that thing you did before.
The surface ships will be back. After the storm clears.
They told me about sixty hours.
Nice work, Captain sir.
It sends 200 volts throughout the cylinder surface.  But we've never used it underwater before.
What was that?
Don't pull it, Norman.  It'll start a <u>fire</u> we can't stop.  Norman?
Good.  Security's been our biggest worry.  Now that you're here we can shut this thing down tight.
-- dating the crash at least that old.
Your report's become our bible down here, Dr. Johnson.  We've been carrying out each of your recommendations -- one by one -- to the smallest detail.
They pressurize us with helium.
Like "Thou shall not kill"?
Don't get hysterical, Norman.
I'm not paranoid.  I know Beth.  She can be drastic.
At the time, I don't know, I thought putting her on the list -- it might help her career -- catch her a break.
Wait a second --
Bullshit.  What's out there isn't alien.  It's an animal.
Going active.
Yes, sir.
Edmunds, get in here.  I need you for this.
How much damage?
It's chipped.
Ted?  Captain?
We know how this craft got here. Where it's been.
No.  They don't represent a message. They aren't decorative at all.  They have another purpose entirely.
So how do we get it open?
Gimme a report, I want --
Who is that?  Where's that coming from?
It's a single sequence repeated over and over.
... spiralling out of the center, you see: "G" is one, "B" is two, "H" is three, and so on... when I got the message.
Not now, Beth.  Please.  I want to know who we're talking to before we start talking.  Where's Edmunds?
With an "o".  Harold with an "o".
A half a mile long?
Ted, get her away from the door.
What's wrong?
What is that?
It won't register.  It's too big to image.
That ULF report everybody's patting me on the back about?
What do you expect?  For them to bring it up here?
Just keep your mouth shut, alright? This could mean everything to our careers, you know that?  Don't jeopardize this.
Where'd this come from?
We have a library?
Wait a minute.
I mean, I'm not... I wasn't absolutely sure if... they --
I didn't do anything wrong.  I didn't mean...
Norman.
Yeah, he <u>told</u> you.  Think.  What was Barnes doing before they cut that cable loose?  He was on the phone. Except that cable is a thousand feet long, Norman.  They would've broken off communication with us four, five minutes before they cleared out.
So who was Barnes talking to at the last minute?  Nobody.
Yeah, okay.  Sure, Norman.
Where are you going in such a hurry?
Forget the sub.
You fixed my suit?
But I don't know how --
The sub's a 100 feet in front of you.  You see it?
What's the matter?
Still clear?
Getting food.  We were out of food. what's wrong?  You sound mad.
None of this was here before.
You think it's me?  You think I'm saying there was a conversation when there wasn't?
He translated it wrong.
It's his fear.  The squid.  He's manifesting his fears.  Making them real.
Nothing about drowsiness.
Riordan?
Damn it!  Chloramphenicol?
It's like a sleeping pill?
What?  Wait -- isn't that dangerous?
Not believing you.
The sphere looks different.
What was that?  I couldn't hear you.
How do you feel about snakes?
What are they doing down here?  In the bathroom?  Suddenly appearing.
He can't manifest.
You're insane.
That's bullshit.
Don't, Beth.  Please.
It's your choice.  Because it's not safe for you to be awake.  To be walking around.  To be thinking about things.
Of course you're going to deny it. You want to blame someone else.  You want to blame Beth.  Because you hate Beth.
Beth!
Where is it coming from, Beth?
You can't stop it, Norman.  You can't fight me.
Oh, sure.  Here.  Anything else, Beth can get you?  Some more chicken, perhaps.  Let Beth check the fridge.
Top shelf, is it?
Get away from me!
No.  I don't think so.
Norman?  Where's Norman?
For who?  The fish?
I'm sorry.  Slip of the tongue.
Just in time, too.
What?
Why are you looking at me like that?
Go ahead.  Ladies first.
Nice work, Norman.
I don't follow you.
I can't believe that, Harry.
Harry, can you tell me about the sphere?
Tell me about the door.  Do you remember how you opened the door to the sphere?... Harry?
These aren't half bad, Fletcher.  You might have a second career coming.
It's the squid!  Stop it!
Push her, c'mon.
Well, press something!
The power allows us to manifest our fears, right?  What if we feared the power to go away?
She told me what you said, Norman.
It didn't fly here.  It <u>arrived</u> here.
Good idea, Ted.
Beth and Harry?
That whole time -- I couldn't stop thinking of what Harry was saying earlier...
Captain Barnes wants to see you right away, sir.
Strange, isn't it?  You know -- how it would have a button.
Squint harder.
Try this one.
Jerry isn't hostile, Norman.  He said earlier -- we were his friends --
In the closet.  I don't understand, Norman -- why would they call you?
Well, now you know... The enemy is on the move.  We haven't much time.
We have to find he rebels... What we're carrying belongs to them.
I think there are some things we should talk about.
Kid, you take the glory and the good intentions and I'll take the reward.
We're into the second perimeter. They'll be coming out to blast us shortly.  I was wondering if you had some kind of a plan or are we going to try to blast our way in?
I'll get the information.
I know who you are.  Stand up so that we can talk properly.  You're embarrassing me.  I'm not that important.
I... I'm not a Bendu Officer.  I'm not even a startrooper.
You saw through me?
You were right.  It is my responsibility.  The Force of Others brought the message to you and then it brought you to me.
Let's just say the Force is something a Jedi Warrior deals with.  It is an energy field in oneself, a power that controls ones acts, yet obeys ones commands.  It is nothing, yet it makes marvels appear before your very eyes. All living things generate this Force field, even you.
It surrounds you and radiates from you.  A Jedi can feel it flowing from him...  ... from here!
We don't have that kind of money. How much do you think I can get for the speeder?
Are you sure you don't need it?
But she is the only link between us and the hidden bases.
That's no battle, kid... They're just sitting there!
As close as we can make out, it appears to be a Corellian gypsy vessel... It's not under power.
All the data banks in Artoo are still secure.
When Artoo has been safely delivered to my forces, you get your reward. You have my guarantee.
Where are you taking us now anyway?
We must hurry to the base.  We have little time before the Death Star arrives.
Who's the pilot?
This isn't going to work.
I don't pick up any life form concentration down there.  She'd better be right.
You're a good pilot... I've learned a lot from you... I wish you...
First thing tomorrow morning you're going to check those condensing units on the south ridge.
There's a lot of carbon scoring here. It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action...
I can't make it.  You go on, master Luke.  It doesn't make sense for you to risk yourself on my account.  I'm done for.
Are you safe?
What makes you think... you'll make... squad leader, Rico ?
Wanting it doesn't make you the best one for the job.
Our love will grow, dear, year by year...
Funny how they always want to be your friends after they kick your guts out.
No way. Big K taught me I ain't executive material.
Sir, I wish to reconsider my request to drop out, sir.
Eight point... no, uh, seven...
All I know is Carmen's going to be a citizen, and I don't think it'll work out for us if I'm not.
You don't approve. Well, too bad. We're in this for the species, boys and girls. It's simple numbers, they have more, and everyday I have to make decisions that send hundreds of people like you to their deaths.
Oh, yes, sir. Vector ?
Well, whad'ya know...
I want to be part of the best flight team in the Fleet...
WHERE IS IT ?
No, I... Oh, Zander, I'm a fool.
Eeuch !
Well, if that's the crop, that must be the gastric caecal...
Then how come you won't hold hands with me at school ?
Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ?
I thought you were going to help Carl.
Zander is going for pilot, too.
He's nothing like you.
Hey, Carl, what's wrong ?
You talk to Carl ?
I'm gonna miss you.
You don't look very happy to see me.
Almost got knocked out of the sky over Big K.
Where's Lieutenant Barcalow ?
This isn't random or light. Someone made amistake...!
Can't we just be friends, Diz ?
Cover me.
Well, see ya.
What frequency ?
Johnny, people get hurt... people get killed in the Federal Service. If something happened to you I don't know what I would do...
Oh, my, what's that ?
I'm telling you, you will ! You're not going back. You're going to go on vacation !
I don't understand it, Lieutenant. It's not getting anything from 4th Brigade... not even their transponder.
Seeing as how we're about all that's left of  1st Brigade, you'd have to call that an improvement.  You top kick ?
I always wanted to go to Zegema Beach.
Geez, I don't think I've ever seen him smile.
Smith, GO ! McIntire, GO ! Flores, GO ! Rico, I'm making you sqaud leader !
Please complete this sentence. I want to be citizen because...
On whose authority, Corporal ?
What's your problem now, Lieutenant ?
Alright, we're gonna carry you...
I wanna join up, Mr. Rasczak. I think I have what it take to be a citizen.
Where'd you learn to do that, soldier ?
All dead except one, sir.
Warm it all up ! Everything you got ! Levy, collect the big guns from the towers. Watkins, put General Owen with the wounded. Rico, where's my communications ?
AAAAAAAAAAAA !
<U>Why</U>?!
The carbon-units are not responsible for that.
Disclose the information.
As I stated, V'ger calls to the Creator.
Yes.
Then you acted properly, of course.
You saved the ship.
Granted.
Recommend defensive posture, Captain: Screens and shields.
I now the Captain meant no person- al insult.
That you left? or that you didn't say 'goodbye'?
Lieutenant Ilia reporting for duty, sir.
Five minutes to Cloud boundary!
Transmit, Mr. Spock! Now!
Reduce magnification. Factor 4, Mr. Sulu.
Clear the bridge, Captain...?
They have... they <U>have</U> been communicating with us. I sense ... <U>puzzlement</U>. Why have we not replied?
The 'puzzlement' I sensed was fleeting... minor...  ... as if carrying a sense of our insignificance, Captain.
No vessel could generate a powerfield of this magnitude...
That vessel is generating a forcefield measurably greater than the radiation of the Earth's sun.
They had a pattern to follow...
Spock? Concerned about his chances?
Bridge, cancel rescue teams.  Spock, what in the hell are you doing out here!
What answers?
Child...!?
Spock, we <U>were</U> its answer!
Captain, we need further Warp simulation on the flow sensors...
That object out there is less than two days from Earth, Mister Scott. We've got to intercept while it still is out there!
Dock control reports ready, sir.
Evening, Annie.
Could you tell me when's the next train?
No, of course, you don't want to talk about it.
But, but but but...
That: in an act of...
...that...he <u>sees</u> that...
So that the Old Mill, the Old <u>Mill</u> represents...the wheel of fate is that too...
The, the, the, the <u>sanctity</u> of everyday things...
...such a pleasant sound.
Hi.
I <u>can</u>?
But how do I...how do I do a film called "The Old Mill," when I don't have an old mill?
What I need to <u>say</u>...
What are you doing down there?
It's for your finger.
Hi.
Start?  This isn't a good time.
You can do it.
What've you got?
...yes.
Where you going?
Pelting down out there.
Good morning.
I can't do that.  If I tell them, they'll, if I <u>tell</u> them, they'll try Bob for rape, they'll...it'll ruin his career...
I...I <u>think</u> that's right...
What are you going to do?
We on for tomorrow night?
Drama Group?
And I might have something important to tell you...
What, what what are you doing here?
We did...?
I'm sorry.
I know em, I don't know what order they come in...
Maude, this <u>man</u> wrote this <u>play</u>!
He had a hard day.  Ann's deserted him for some guy on the movie.
But, does it have to be an Old Mill?
<u>This</u> is your movie, this is small town America.
Yeah, but they never made a movie here.
...why am I here...?
It's Marty on the Coast -
Whyn't you learn your lines?
The prices are going up.
Well, I'm pretty impolite.  Would you like some?
Are you all right...?
What else?
The people came to see a motion <u>Picture</u>.  ...hold on...
She's a <u>waitress</u>.
You don't need "Hi I've just come from the restaurant."
Are you Okay?
Is Mr. Barrenger there...?
You guys had better leave us a...
...I have to give you this <u>ticket</u> for damage to city property.  I'm really sorry, Sir, it's a formality, I hope you'll excuse...
No.
You can't treat me like this.  I'm not a child!
Look.
Claire, when did you...
This scene is why I'm doing the movie. "Look at the mill, Frank -- look at the way it goes around...<u>half</u> of the time the darned wheel's under water, but..."
You can't do what?
I know that, Claire.  I, we <u>all</u> know...
...I...
An artist of your caliber...
...yes...
That's cor...
Oh, really, then why don't you sue me in the World Court.  Did she like the costumes?
Why not?
...I just swore my life away, back in that...
Well you guess what.  The Mayor sent me. I have your Mr. Barrenger with a history of...
Could you tell me where a fellow goes to get a drink in this town?
I had a witness I would.
He saw the accident...?
I...
I'm very sorry I...
Not now.
My <u>wife's having a baby</u>...
We can't shoot the Old Mill.
We're out of money.
The movie's about <u>purity</u>.  So we don't <u>show</u> her breasts.  We show them to <u>him</u>, her back to the camera.
Thank God, it's up to you, Pal.  Sup to you...
And my company sues your ass for sixty million dollars.
<u>Siddown</u>!
How do they know that, you told them?
How do you know you saw it?
You didn't see it...
I'm gonna' bring it off.
<u>Stop</u>...
Marty...
I CAN'T PUT A COMPUTER IN A MOVIE SHOT IN 1895...you wanna tell me how I'm gonna' do that?
NO NO NO NO NO, PAY HER OFF.  DID YOU HEAR ME?
He just saved us eight hundred thousand bucks.
Mmm.
Waal, then, invite someone <u>else</u>, then...
I've got two days to get this house...
I want them thrown in jail.
I have to tell you, I can not <u>express</u> to you how <u>happy</u>...
I read for that part.  Did pretty good too.
Where are we?
&quot;Those who travel far and near this will make you DISAPPEAR!&quot;
Ben!  What's wrong?
It just slipped out.
What happens when he loves Rachel more than us?
Lord Nelson, Napoleon's troops.  I fear for the women and the property values.
Well, not exactly s...
How would you know sh...
Well Daddy and I are just friends now, and that's no reason not to wear mascara...
I hope it's the right kind.
...I mean, she knows all the music, and pop stars, and clothes and stuff. She's like still a kid, herself.
What's Thursd...
I could help with the debate.
He's not even there.  You don't see him, you don't hear him, you're just too much of a woman to bother with little boys.
How many devilled eggs can you eat?
Darling, I've been thinking about our little Brad problem?  And I think it's time we move to Plan B...
Keep Ben's for awhile, okay?  Until he's old enough to not open them all at once.
Never mind.  I'll just eat my lunch.
I'm sorry, okay?  Let's not fi...
Hold lunch!
What if he's kidnapped?
C'mon, these are the Bomb, I prom...
Annabelle, I know you miss your mother.  So why don't you say hello.
And Mom says anger never, never <u>solves</u> anything.  It makes every- thing <u>worse</u>.
Help me here...
Great.  Big ears, too?
Uh.  What is it?
The guy <u>I</u> see is in the eighth grade at <u>Prep</u> School, and he laughs his <u>ass</u> off every time we talk about you.
Now Ladies, the secrets to a great pie is the crust.  And the secret to a great flaky pie crust comes from less flour and more...what?
You do NOT run out on your moth...
You know, this horse smells really bad.
You touched it.
Excuse me --
&quot;Goodnight moon, goodnight hush, goodnight mush, goodnight goodnight goodnight Gracie -- Goodnight Ben!
...for Christmas, okay?  Every magician needs a white dove, a <u>real</u> one, they <u>do</u>!
Queen of diamonds.
You'll be up to your armpits in meatballs, I'm flying them in from Sweden.

If a soldier loses his legs in a war.  Is he the same guy?  Sure he is.
It's not good enough.
Why would his worry?  Or my children's worry.  Or anyone's worry.  Help the sit...
Which part of no don't you understand?
You can't <u>do</u> that, I won't <u>let</u> you!
Me too.
Just outside the big top, we're almo...
At the Big Apple Circus, it's the only big top I know.  I <u>said</u> I'd get 'em back tonight...
But he hasn't.  He wandered off.  I know it's terrifying.  I can imagine how you felt when that call came -- But it happens.
Still, please.
I didn't think a phone call was appropriate...
It's going to be hard for the kids when I tell them...I'd like you to be there.
We...
What happened with Annabelle?  Has nothing I said gotten through to you?
She's been talking about this little editing machine, it's only...
Did you or Luke talk to her about it afterwards?
You mean for you.  A 10-year-old girl is coping with the fact that her father is never coming back to live with his family.  She sees her father naked with another woman for the first time. And you think it's best for her if every- one pretends it didn't happen?  This isn't going to work out.
I have a snoop.
However many.  It's not enough.
Bandaids for cuts.  Bandaids for new shoe blisters.  Packet of Wash n Dri's. Kleenex.  Sugar free lollipops, potty seat covers for public restrooms...
Then let him talks to me.  We don't need you to solve our prob...
I got used to...thinking of them. As...my kids too.
They came out of my <u>body</u>!
Okay, I'm undeserving.
And you said...?
Hey, you haven't quit on you, I'm sure as hell not gonna.  I just mean, I'm juggling a lot right n...

Thanks for coming out.
What's this about?  Because we <u>fought</u>?
Well, it's the Jack Kennedy Syndrome, huh?  You die young, you always look golden.  Perfect.  The memory kind of burnishes the image, and...
With good reason.  They fucking worship you as it is.
You know every story, every wound, every memory, their whole life's <u>happiness</u> has been wrapped up in <u>you</u>, every moment...
Okay, if they're going to <u>have</u> a sauce, put something <u>in</u> it besides flour and chicken broth...
We have the kids this weekend, so...
But?  But what?
No problem.
No prob. I'm cool.
Well, technically your Zeda is a survivor.
Nice to have you here.
And thank you for dressing up for us. This is very classy. Tell us. What kind of professional plans do you have? What's in your future?
Do you have any brothers or sisters?
But when you're not. Like now. What do you like to do?
Yes, you are. I can tell. What's the matter?
Maybe it's for the bestI mean, if he was guilty of doing  something wrongPeople who are bad should be killed. Don't you think so?
Maybe he was and you just didn't know it.
Why was he on Death Row?
This is definitely better.
I dunno, Toby. We really have a long way to go. You still need a lot more footage, and it's probably a little premature to start screening
We're not ready.
Not to be crass, but what do we get out of this?
We did the same thing last year also.
You've lost interest...You hardly even sweat any more when we have sex.
Which is it? You gotta keep your focus straight.
Oh, I know, I know that. Well, sharing your story, your ups and downs, and so forth, can I hope, be an illuminating experience.
So? How was school today?
Yeah, uh, listen. Why don't you go upstairs and keep your Mom and Brady company for a bit? I need to speak alone with Consuelo for a moment.
Hello, Vi.
Fuck me hard!
Nigger, fuck me hard!
Hello?
So what's going on?
But...you called.
Anything I might know about?
Oh? Anything I might have seen?
Yeah. You didn't wanna take me to the prom.
Yeah...So you're um...you're married?
Listen, Toby, I can't really talk right now. Do you mind if I call you back?
Scooby?
Is this to like get into Sundance?
What is most important to you?
Oh, my God, Scooby! I'm so sorry...I'm so, so sorry...
Uh-oh!  Do you know if the demands are being taken seriously at this point, or does Washington think these people are just a bunch of crazy fuckers playing games?
We got trouble.  That bodyguard son- of-a-bitch has them running all over the field--just took out three on the north end!
Is he with the girl?
I'll lead.
I said I'll lead.
Anything else?  Maybe a sandwich?
What are we going to do!
Let's move it we got company!
Let me tell you something Cooper! I never once bad-mouthed him during all those months--
How well do you know this place?
That's it!  Up ahead!
Go fuck yourself...
You see, it paid off--you broke away from the old guard, congresswoman.  It won't be long till they're calling you Senator Filmore--
What about Cooper--where is he?
Who's Ryan Cooper?
Chemco makes many things senator! We were under government contract!
Something tells me you don't want to be on TV, friend.
Where the hell could they have gone!
Our traveler's insurance, you know what I mean?
Are we adrift--
Of the separate chemicals--I don't know, uh, offhand--
Please be calm, Ambassador De Sade.
War-mongering bully!  Don't think you're going to intimidate me!
Thank you, Admiral.
If he's not there, try...  87 - 43 - 56.
What's the meaning of this?
Well, it has been explained to me that, if you add a thick Cobalt-Thorium-G jacket to a nuclear device, the radio- activity resulting from such a nuclear explosion will retain its lethal power for a hundred years.
The source was...shall we say, completely reliable.
This dreadful accident could never have happened if your government hadn't cynically and hypocritic- ally blocked every proposal we made for disarmament or arms control!!
Excuse me, Mister President, but you forgot to give me my camera back.
Then all you have to do is untrigger it.
My seven body orifices????
Get a grip on yourself, Major!
What happened, Major?  Some kind of private beef between the two of you?
Sure I do.  There was some kind of mutiny on the base, and you killed General Ripper.
You've wasted enough of my time, fella.
What about the President?
Operator...How much would the call be station-to-station?...Thirty-five cents cheaper?...I'd still be short twenty cents ...Just a second, operator...  Colonel, shoot the lock off the Coke machine.  There's bound to be enough change in there.
I'm sorry, sir.  General Schmuck is asleep and he isn't taking calls until eight-thirty.
I didn't say anything.  What's the meaning of disturbing me at this hour, Colonel?
Well, sir, they may not allow the Special Service troops to enter the base.
Under the circumstances, General, what would you think they should do?
Combat Operations Center, Major Mandrake speaking.
Good.  Has the Wing confirmed holding at X-points?
That's right.  I want this flashed to all section immediately.
Major, that's all I've been told.  Just got it on the red phone.  The base is to be sealed tight.  And I mean tight.
What's the gun for, General Ripper?
That is correct, Major.
I suppose they are, sir.
Well, I think I remember reading the report on that.  Wasn't it something like a hundred and sixty million?
Where, sir?
How could you let this happen, General Schmuck?
We don't operate like you KGB boys.
General Schmuck, are you positive of your figures?
Yes?
What's the target.
Is there any chance a single aircraft can penetrate the entire enemy Air Defense, when its course and target are known?
General, stick to the point, please.
A through H is correct.
They can't touch us at this height.
Sorry, King.  My leg's stiff as a board.
Well, listen, King.  Could you take her up to about eight hundred?  That'll help you come in at a nice down-angle, and it'll give us a chance for our chutes to open.
Primary arming switch.
Where'd they get you?
No kidding.
Release first safety.
Master safety.
I don't know what we got left besides Bim and Bam.
You sure have to hand it to those guys.
What do you mean?
Wait a minute, Major.  "OPE," that's the recall code.  Where would they get that?
Our orders warn us to expect the enemy to use ingenuity in issuing contrary and confusing orders.  And therefore, to disregard anything that doesn't come on the CRM-114.
Then that settles it, doesn't it?
I said that's the point!
There are plenty of traitors and spies running around loose.
Who's that?
Lothar, can you arm the bombs for impact?
There's no other way, Lothar.  Can you re-arm the bombs for impact?
Forget it.
It would not be difficult.  Nuclear reactors could provide power almost indefinitely. Greenhouses could maintain plant life. Animals could be bred and slaughtered. A quick survey would have to be made of all the suitable minesites in the country, but I shouldn't be surprised if several hundred thousand of our people could be accomodatedd. Every nation would undoubtedly follow suit.
Mn-hm.
In Group?
That was really great.
Yeah!
Want a beer?  Is Pony coming?
Yeah, we all want to see him. So when's he coming?
It's really not about anything.
Oh yeah? Oh, how'd you ship it over there, man? Federal Express? Hm? By the time it got there it'd be way cold and coagulated. Total waste. Cheese be stuck to the cardboard.
But, so, Pony's comin' by here to the corner?
I don't know. Later. I don't know.
I'd get bored.
That sounds so great, man. Yes. Yes. Hey, what would you do in the afternoon?
So, do you guys want to do something, go someplace or something like that?
You know what we should do? Go to the...
She was at the Four Seasons last night, man. But you shouldn't worry about that.
No. Life is too short.
Sure.
Yeah, we all stayed at the Four Seasons, man. It was party time. Hey, I hung out with Danny, Pony's manager. Really nice guy. We talked about the video. They want a raw look. Something fresh. Danny said if I can capture the reality of Burnfield, it'd make a great tape.
But I'd, I'd do it for free. You know, just for my reel.
No man, she showed up last night at the hotel. We has a great time together. I stayed in her room last night, man. What can I say?
Yeah, man.
See, I wasn't making shit up, man.
Ah, you know people there?
Hey, I'm Sooze.
Pony? What's a "pony"? You mean that geek who played the folk music at the senior prom? What's that guy's name? Neil Moynihan?
Oh, you were in the band?
Oh, how did you get burnt-out?
Oh, my God, you found it. Thank you so much.  Did you get your tape?
I'll tell you what. When I get my engineering degree and I'm swimming in my swimming pool, it will be very fucking okay.
Yeah, well, uh, you're not so smart, chief, 'cause I'm moving out to L.A.
So tell us, man. Party time, trashin' hotel rooms, babes around the clock?
I don't care. I'm gonna drop it. I'm gonna drop it. I'm...
Hey, I'm glad you put truth in your song, man. That's important.
Come on, man. Sh, sh, sh.
You know what would be cool is, like, to do a music video, you know? But, like, you know, have it set in here. You know, like, like, like, with her and shit. You know, like, you know, like, "Closed, closed, closed, closed, closed, closed."
Who's going to slow me down? You, you fat pig.
Will you stand up for me?
Oh, me too. Middle-class.
Yes.
Erica.
Hi.
Nice to meet you Sooze.  Hi, I'm Erica.
It's coming along.
Erica, you coming?
Uh-huh.
No, that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying I don't need a limousine to know who I am, alright?
Well, w-what happened?
What'd you do?
They let you out?
Why? Because I give a shit?
Because I care, I'm a fucking fool?
You know, and what are you doing here in the first place, man? He's just gonna call the cops again.
They never hurt me? They hurt me every day with their attitude. You know, like they even have a right. Who the fuck do they think they are? Let me tell you something, I was born here. Alright? I'm an American. And I'm owed something. Look, they took it from me.
Jeff, stay there.
Tim, can we go? This is ridiculous.
You know, it's not you. You know? You seem like a smart guy.
Because maybe if we know each other's names, things wouldn't get like this, My name's Jeff.
Nazeer what?
This has nothing to do with me! She went up by herself. Yeah I tell them don't go on the roof! They can't go on the roof!  How is she?
Yeah, man, male, significant other, whatever the fuck I am.
God, KAREN JOHNSON.
Yes, I stand for -
It was a racial incident.
What?
Yeah, uh, that would depend, but yeah. She should.
No, I don't.
FUCK! Pony, if we wanted to hear you sing, we would've gone to your concert!
What?
Oh, yeah?
Wait, away?
Go.
You really suck, you know that?
No, it's not...
Yeah.
So you think I should?
Now?
Yeah, well, that's what I do too.
No, man. Hey. No, you know what? Hey, it's you, man. It's, you know what, you know what it is? It's this tarpit of stupidity that we're all stuck in. It's this cell. It's this void, you know.
You know, why do you call me names? You know, I never hurt you. I'm only working here.
Get off my property!
Get off my roof!
Ready?
I hope you're happy!
You showed up. Oh, my god! Holy shit! Look at this car, man!
No, she was just sitting there?!
Would I get paid?
Okay, now, you guys all take care, okay? Oh, man, I feel so good. I feel good 'cause I'm hanging out with you guys, man. You know? I mean, I forgot what it was like to just hang out.
Yeah, come on, play it.
"Drove down the highway there was a big jam The family had died There inside their minivan There was a backup It went on for miles But as bad as it was It was gone after a while"  Chorus here.  "You may think there's nothing to it and the truth is hard to see To be an invisible man is a remarkable thing to be thing to be thing to be"
Yeah. Burnfield, Pizza and Puke capital of the world.
Soon.
Tim?
Where's Erica? You seen her?
Oh, come on, Pony. I'm just kidding. Wow, you rock stars are really sensitive, huh? You know, there's a life on the road?
What are you going to do? Hm?
Hey, great game Friday. Kicked Holbrook's ass, huh?
Just one?
Yeah. Yeah. How's the air force, Tim?
Fucking drunk, huh?
Hey, your gonna regret this.
Leave him alone, Tim.
Wait!  Did you say you are pregnant or you were pregnant... You had it, threw it out and you're gonna go back and dance all night!
Holy shit.
I'm in, too.
Another sex dream?
Di, we're sorry.  We...
Is Jack upset that he can't be here?
Use the bathroom, because the Port-a Potties on the field are gross.
Oh my G-d, you've been robbed!
Oh G-d, I'm sorry... You're not really fat!  I was just saying that because, uh, I thought that's what you wanted me to say.
Oh my G-d, I read about this!  It's called a "pregnancy insanity."  Quick, she needs a sitz bath --
But, we have to make a smart plan!
I see a flower.  And y'know, even the most beautiful flowers still grow from dirt.
So, while we're knee deep in right now - and things seem pretty "stinky" - in the long run, we're going to grow strong from this.
I sure do.
Like Cocoa Puffs.  Good.  Captain Crunch.  Bad.  Shreds the roof of your mouth.  I mean you hear, "Tricks are for kids!"  And you think, "I'm a kid, I guess they're for me."  But your baby brain's got no idea that Fruit Loops are, like, a million times better.  I'm going to save our kid all that pain.
I never knew you dreamed of working in a grocery store bank branch.  Baby, we are living the great American Dream!
...so although their dad said, "Don't get out of the car until I get back with help," they knew the sheriff's voice as he yelled.  "Run to my voice - and don't look back."  The twins did as he said, but at the last second they turned around and saw the escaped mental patient, bouncing their father's head on the top of the car!  Ah!  They jumped, Diane!  They jumped!
Nope.  Sounds more like the first.
Madonna.
Hey.  Eyes on your own belly!
Yeah, hold on.
Yeah?
No.  This is Diane.  I think you have the wrong number.
Are you girls talking about boys? Practicing kissing your hands?
You got that big retarded girl down there?
Really...
Bank branch!
My best friend got pregnant.
We're ready with the shot, Mr. deMille.
Roll 'em.
Give me your coat.
Wait a minute.  This is the woman I love.  What's going on? Who was loaded?
It's from hunger.
Just a rehash of something that wasn't very good to begin with.
This is Miss Kramer.
Well....
Sheldrake likes that angle about the teacher.
Sorry, Miss Schaefer, but I've given up writing on spec.
Look, if you don't mind, I haven't got time to listen to the whole plot ...
Sorry.  It's your baby now.
It's just impossible.
Good.
It's that old familiar story, you help a timid little soul across a crowded street.  She turns out to be a multimillionaire and leaves you all her money.
Not once.  What's wrong with being on the other side of the cameras? It's really more fun.
What's wrong with you tonight? What is it, Betty?
Stop crying.  You're getting married.  That's what you've always wanted.
Hers.
Just look around.  There's a lot of her spread about.  If you don't remember the face, you must have heard the name of Norma Desmond.
Want something to drink?  There's always champagne on ice, and plenty of caviar.
Her own movie theatre.
I'm trying to tell you.  This is an enormous place.  Eight master bedrooms.  A sunken tub in every bathroom.  There's a bowling alley in the cellar.  It's lonely here, so she got herself a companion. A very simple set-up: An older woman who is well-to-do.  A younger man who is not doing too well ... Can you figure it out yourself?
Come on where? Back to a one-room apartment that I can't pay for? Back to a story that may sell and very possibly will not?
Hello, young fellow.
Last time I saw you was someplace very gay.  I remember waving to you. I was dancing on a table.
What's the matter, Norma?
Nothing would thrill me more -- if it were possible.
They're dead.  They're finished. There was a time when this busi- ness had the eyes of the whole wide world.  But that wasn't good enough.  Oh, nol They wanted the ears of the world, too.  So they opened their big mouths, and out came talk, talk, talk...
And you have written pictures, haven't you?
It's the story or Salome.  I think I'll have DeMille direct it.
What month?
It's getting kind of late --
The name is Gillis.  I'm single.
You'll like it here.
You can't work in an apartment where you owe three months' rent.
Now, now, don't let's be small about such matters.  We won't keep books.  Go on, unpack Mr. Gillis' things.
They don't?  Then why do they still write me fan letters every day. Why do they beg me for my photo- graphs?  Because they want to see me, me, me!  Norma Desmond.
I want to talk to you for a minute.
They've come for my car.
I need some money right now.
Hold me tighter.
You think this is all very funny.
Is it funny that I'm in love with you?
Keep it.
What's the matter with you?
Who? Some car hop, or a dress extra?
Why don't you just say thank you and go, go, go --
I hope you realize, Norma, that scripts don't sell on astrologers' charts.
Pull up at the drugstore, will you, Max.  I'll get you some.
What on earth, darling? It took you hours.
I can still see myself in the line: Bebe Daniels, Marie Prevost, Mabel Normand ... Mabel was always stepping on my feet ...What's the matter with you, darling?  Why are you so glum?
How did it go?
He must be quite a guy.
What are you doing, Joe?  What are you doing?  You're not leaving me?
See, you didn't believe me!.. Now I suppose you don't think I have the courage!
That's a lie!  They still want me!
You heard him.  I'm a star!
I'm the greatest star of them all.
She was the greatest.  You wouldn't know.  You are too young.  In one week she got seventeen thousand fan letters.  Men would bribe her mani- curist to get clippings from her fingernails.  There was a Maharajah who came all the way from Hyderabad to get one of her stockings.  Later, he strangled himself with it.
Uh-huh?
You send them.  Is that it, Max?
No, I haven't.  I suppose all the waxworks are coming?
How about my going up the kitchen stairs and undressing in the dark. Will that do it?
So they tell the kid to throw the World Series, or else, huh?
Of course, we're always looking for a Betty Hutton.  Do you see it as a Betty Hutton?
Now wait a minute.  If we made it a girls' softball team, put in a few numbers.  Might make a cute musical: It Happened in the Bull Pen -- the story of a Woman.
Forget Romanoff's.  It's the car I'm talking about.  If I lose my car it's like having my legs out off.
Did the deceased ever threaten you? Were you in fear of bodily injury?
Bring something to drink.
Cameras? ...What is it, Max?
You and your husband have been kind to me, Alura. I have something to tell you: I'm going away. Soon.
What does it mean?
I came as quickly as I could. What is the danger?
That's easy for you to say, Bianca.
That little girl? Ha.  Now go on, get me some tools.
Wait...don't leave me in here...
Let me out. I have to talk to you.
When can I see, you again ?
You're alive! She didn't kill you!
My angel. My goddess. I feel I've always loved you all my life. I'll die if I can't spend the rest of my life just looking at you, holding you in my arms...
Where Superman's from? Krypton?
I used to work here summers when I was a kid.
We're from different worlds.
If we wait until we understand everything we'll be dead. Come on. You can learn more from one kiss than from years in school.
Away. From you.
That makes it worse.
And now?
But what if---it wasn't real?
Why not? You're a good-looking girl. And I'm--- available.
And you can see how you feel about me, right?
You've had your fun, Selena, the game is over.
I'm wise to your tricks, lady.
You've been without water for a whole day. Let's see how thirsty you get in a week.
Where is your cousin Clark, by the way?
Can I give you a lift?
Superman will return it.
What's a tree?
I can do that.
I'm afraid I have some bad news about your car.
What can I do for you?
I have plans Nigel. You could come with me... I'm going places.
Nigel, get out of here. And don't come slithering back. Nigel shakes his head.
You're wasting your breath.
...trust the wisdom of the ancients, trust the Great Mother to protect us... Why. are you staring at me like that?
Ever since I found that thing I've been like a prisoner in a terrible nightmare. You have no idea how awful it is to be mean all the time.
They'll be grateful. If you hadn't found it, it would still be lost. Look, up ahead.
It's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can unleash all sorts of terrible forces---
...mid pleasures and palaces though I may roam..."
There is a way.
Then teach me how.
Superpowers. Got you in a lot of trouble, didn't they?
You're going to take me back?
Zaltar. Use the wand!
Not enough vodka in it.
Aha! What'd I tell ya!
Brad is not a good name for a cocktail.
I can't  Clark already asked me.  Didn't you?  He used to love this song.  Didn't you?  So he just said --  "Would you dance with me?"
And three years after the Royal Wedding, the King abdicated.  Isn't that terrible?
Well, it's true you have to be careful things don't spoil, especially with mayonnaise or cream.
And even nicer when there's a man around, Which isn't all that often.
Gee, I haven't laughed like that since -- since --  I really can't remember when.
That's the biggest change in Smallville, you know. They've taken over this town. Everybody who isn't actually working for Wheat King -- like I do -- is out there --  on a Wheat King thresher.  Do you think I could do it? Do you?
No, what you said before, Could I make it in Metropolis? I've dreamed about it, sure, but I never really thought about it.  What would I do when I got there?
I'm getting a cramp in my elbow from this.
Do you really know Superman?
Hi. Mister Kent.  Guess who Mom's having dinner with tonight? Superman!
Anyway, the reunion's just the hook for the story. What it's really about is how the typical small town's changed in the last fifteen years. how do you like this a title: Can You Go Home Again ?
You're the best, Lois.
Ah yes, August Gorman. Have you looked for work this week, Mr. Gorman?
What kind?
Mr. Gorman, according to our records you have been unemployed for 36 weeks.
Not counting this week.  You secured employment last June as a messenger and were discharged after one day for. . .
Thirty-six weeks of chronic unemployment, thirty-six weeks of living off the taxes of hard-working citizens. Do you know what you are?
Workin' overtime? What are you doin', buddy, looking for a raise?
Please, Mr. Webster, you're a great humanitarian. Ain't you heard what it's like in them jails? You send an innocent boy in and he gets thrown in with killers and robbers and rapers and raper killer and robber rapers and...
Gus, do you know what I want now? I want coffee!
Man, what is this?
Columbia.
Uh...what channel were you watching?
That's what I been thinkin' about. How you been keepin' me.  I ain't getting' nothing outta this gig.
Lookit, you're getting' what you want all the time. it ain't right that I don't get somethin'! I never get somethin'!
A waste-basket? GUS Those are plans.  Blueprints.
I invented it, man. In my head. It's a stone killer-diller get-down get-it-on and twice-on-Sunday super mutha computer.
Anything.
Yeah? How's it look?
Can you do that?
You want to mess with Superman?
Hey, you're perfectly safe.
No, we're just going down.
Whatcha wanna stop here for?  Not that I ain't glad to be on the ground, y'understand.
Thanks.  Let's go
Thank ...you.
What terrific story?
I thought you'd never get here.
Well, don't let me keep you from anything.
Never.  I get air-sick. You wouldn't like that.
If you don't mind, we are trying to hold a meeting here!
"At a special session of the General Assembly, 178 countries voted to censure Superman. With only Columbia abstaining." ROSS That fella's becoming a public menace.
Mr. White, the next number, please?
I don't know who. Whom. I can't trace it.  In the old days it was simple. We kept books, we had ledgers, we could see what was going in and what was paid out. If somebody wanted to rob you, he'd come in with a gun and say 'stick 'em up."  Now they get theses blasted computers to do their dirty work!
Vulcan is the weather satellite						our government put up in orbit to monitor the weather.
He ruined it! That lousy do-gooder, he ruined it.
That's it! The last tanker! They're all mine now! All...
He's the only one who can operate this --
Hostages?
One thousand?? That's an awful lot of oranges. You know there are pill, Lois. I've seen them.
I don't?
I do?
Yeah, thanks. . . . I mean, really! Posing as newlyweds to uncover the honeymoon racket in Niagara Falls.  I mean,. imagine wasting a great reporter -  -- uh, reporters -- on this.  Perry White and his Sunday Magazine exposes.
I mean it strikes me funny that every time Superman comes around, you disappear.
Oh Clark, no!
I didn't think I wanted to.
See what happens when I don't have my orange juice?  The human body is only a workable, fairly fragile machine when you treat it with the same respect you'd show to ----  . . . gee . . .
I'll try to remember that . . .
Don't you watch television? Don't you listen to the radio?
But . . ..that's terrible!
Well done, Miss Teschmacher.
This way Lex.
Artemis? Do you read me?
For many eons the peoples of our world have lived together in harmony. Then there appeared among us three anti-social elements - what on Earth are classified as "criminals."
DELETE IN CUTTING
Why?
Shhhhhhh!
Oh my Fullness, as I explained to you before, I am about the best there is. Second best there is.
You must be freezing.
You said it. Three-to-one should get you 								both ears and the tail.
Who is this . . . Superman?
Then we must go there too.  To rule. Finally - to rule!  And then you shall have what you want.
So this is the planet Houston . . .
This "super" man is nothing of the kind. I have discovered his weakness.
He's captured Non!
It's brilliant. Daddy thinks so, too. You'll write a new series -- 'Metropolis After Hours.'
My prom was so boring. We all flew to Paris the next day to recover . . . Sometimes my whole life seems boring. I thing maybe I should just give everything away and go live among the poor people. Then I remember how smashing I look in sable . . . oh, it's all so confusing. You think I'm silly, don't you?
Well, my career takes up a lot of my time.
Now you try, Clark. We'll start you off with 60 pounds.
Oh . . . my . . .
No Paris?
Oh, probably just a picture request. I'll take care of it if you want, Lois.
It must have been a super effort to get out of bed, Clark.
Close the curtains. The sun is hurting my eyes.
But Superman isn't an average man.
Not so fast!  All trips are canceled. We pay for wire services. And what we don't get from them, we'll invent.
Darling, it's good riddance. Let her go. And while you're at it, fire that Clark Kent. He hasn't been here in days. He hasn't even called.
He missed the door, Uncle Lex.
Whoa. . .
Gee, Uncle Lex, I was just getting to the good part.
The one Superman wrecked up?
Hey! He looks . . . normal.
Hey! Just remember I made you.
You think he'll find us.
But . . . but isn't the world about to be osterized?
You'll be designing monuments soon, Albert! Hotels! Palaces!
Ah! The guest of honor at last! And about time, too!
But Mr. Luthor, sir, I already  --
It's very simple, Otis.  Very simple, the XK101 rocket. It's nothing, forty years ago we in the Fatherland were working on this. Five more years, we would've had it. But then  --  --  that silly war...Why, my cousin Werner had already  --
A hot story, huh?
Don't worry, Mom. I know.
I'd like to.
See? Didn't I tell you this was a tough town?
For what? Oh, I've see the way the other half lives. My sister, for instance. it looks terrific, but is that what I really want? Three kids, two cats, and fifteen needlepoint pillows? I'd go bananas after one week. Hell, I need this crazy existence of mine.  Like I need the plague, right? That's what your thinking.
There weren't any wires. I looked.
He grabbed me! He held me! He set me down gently! How could that be done with mirrors?
Why would he do that? How would he know I was going to suddenly slip.
You're just jealous.
Oh, what a chance! If I could just  --  get to him.
What can I tell you? He's my leader.
It isn't a Park Avenue address. really.
So I've noticed.
Streets, Sunlight. When was the last time I saw sunlight.
Again???
I'm going to bed.
They stop for nothing.
You got wax in your ears?
Then -
As an irredeemable criminal? You compare me to them?
Two.
Boy!
Well - gotta change that tire if were gonna get home.
We'll say he's a child to my cousin in North Dakota, and just now orphaned.  Poor thing.
Or twenty-four as it is in Earth time. Furthermore, if you will reveal yourself, your enemies will have a way of getting at you where you are vulnerable: by hurting the people you care for.  Ah, this Earth...this world you live in, Kal-El...  Resist its temptations, its rewards, especially its political system.
Here's the story on that East 19th Street murder spree. Page one with a banner headline seems about right to me.
If one of you can get that  -- I mean, I want the real Superman. Who is he? Where's he from? What's his favorite ball team? What's up?
If I do, you can punish  me. Fly me to Bermuda and just lave me there for two weeks.  This is fantastic! I wish Clark were here.
Oh, I've got to get some matches.  My cigarette.
Well, I mean it's not everybody that can deliver an air mail letter without putting a stamp on it.
Oh.
Is it true you're impervious to pain?
What color underwear am I wearing?
Where do you hail from?
I gave him steady employment --
Cleaning a rock, Otis?  Jot it down. As soon as we're back, he feeds the pets.
What is this??!
Well  --  you've got me! What can I say?
At the San Andreas Fault. Maybe you've heard of it.
Still, foolishly, perhaps, I had a theory that eliminates the Presidential push-button.  I was doing my homework...
Well, that's their problem, T.S. But  --  but the XK 101 also works on a radio wave control system. The problem was to find out the frequency. Problems, problems, I've had so many...
Ally.  That's right.
I'm just fine, Ally.  What about you?
Yes...fine.
I don't remember the name.  It was near a beach.
She's in trouble?
What...does it turn to?
Well, it was nice meeting you again, Mr. Stephens.
Well, it being so depressing and all.  But it's reality.  You can't just turn this off because you happen to think it's a bad idea.
That's wrong, Sam.  You know that. We'll be tangled up in this thing for the next five years.  This is never going to go away...
Does this mean I can't take a shower?
Yes.
Your kids never cry.
Because I have to.
Is it true that you gave Nicole one of Lydia's dresses?  That she was wearing it when the bus crashed?
Yes.  The old-fashioned way.
That's right.
But Dolores said she saw a dog and tried to...
I didn't ask if you wanted milk.
That was Billy Ansel on the phone. He wants to come over to talk to us.
The Pied Piper of Hamelin. By famous Hanover city; The river Weser, deep and wide, Washes its wall on the southern side; A pleasanter spot you never spied; But, when begins my ditty...
It's like a song.
Nicole?
Dolores.
I have no questions.
What do you mean?
Tell me about the Ottos.
Nothing's wrong with trying to talk to me, Zoe.
That's not news, Zoe.
I can hear you breathing, Daddy.
Oh God, I'm scared.
I'm a lawyer.
Please, let me explain.  I'll only take a moment of your time.
You think someone else caused the accident?
Are you expensive?
Probably half a dozen traffic convictions.  Drunk driving.  Lost his licence.  That's why he don't work no more.
My usual place.  On the right side. The first seat.
Yes.
I was scared.
Mrs.  Driscoll was driving too fast? What made you think that, Nicole?
How fast would you say Mrs. Driscoll was going?  To the best of your recollection?
You're going to blow everyone away.
What's so funny?
They say I'm lucky because I can't remember the accident.
He couldn't look at me.  But I looked at him.  Right at him.  His secret was mine now.  We used to share it.  But not anymore.  Now, I owned it completely.
Will the police do anything to her?
Well, there's the Hamiltons.  Joe and Shelly Hamilton.
You ought to stop this nonsense, Loretta, these two dollar bets.
Where are we running?  What am I missing here?
How are you tonight, Mr. Falco?
Come on boys, break it up...
Did she accept?
Excuse me, Steve.  I said namely you shouldn't go around wild, blaming people without justification.
You don't know that lunatic yet? Whims - egotistic whims!  Like the gag - when you got him for a friend, you don't need an enemy!  That's what the fight with Bartha was about. "Leo", I says, "Hunsecker froze me out.  So I'm eating humble pie this month - please print me an item."
I hate J.J. -- but not that much at this moment...
Blessings on thee, the both...well... Gotta run now.  See you two kids later!
Mr. Hunsecker, there's nothing to that smear.  You have my sincere word...
Take it easy, Susie.  He wouldn't be much of a man if he didn't understand my concern.  Would you, son?
Is it news to you?
Why do you keep coupling me with Falco?
I don't take kindly to you and Falco selling me ethics.  Who's the injured party here, you?
Susie, as always, is free to say anything she thinks.  Go on, dear, say exactly what's on your mind, dear.
May I lift my eyebrows?  What is this?  What are you trying to do?
What a question, dear, with that newspaper in your hand...
You know, dear, we're drifting apart, you and I, and I don't like that.
I started to say we're drifting apart.  A year ago, in your wildest dreams, would you have walked by that door without taking up this situation with me?  Today I had to call you in!
Err...the Supreme Court story, I was telling you - Justice Black.
And I believe that's precisely where I read it, too.  You see, J.J., where I get my reputation for being the best-informed man in Washington.
Say hello to Sidney Falco.  Tickle him - he's been a bad boy tonight. He called you my fat friend.
What, some cheap, gruesome gags?
No, lemme finish.  I DON'T LIKE THIS JOB!  That boy is dumb only on matinee days - otherwise he's got a head.  And Susan, like you said, she's growing up.  Two heads. What I mean, we got a slippery, dangerous problem here!
Well, what have I got?  Alimony to a pair of tramps?  They're of no concern to me.  It's you who count, but don't get me wrong - I don't intend to let you break your neck again!
I got that boy coming over here.  What's so funny?
Are you listening?
Why do something that would drive them right back into each other's arms?  Not to mention that this time Susie would know who shot the arrow...
It's nice, Sidney, that you give me this tip...
I thought he would.
Bribing me again?
I don't think so.
Avidly.  He was staring.
He was writing a special Sunday piece on...?
Do you think you could do something, Sidney?
Do you still keep your key under the mat?
Yeah!
No, an arm, he said.  I told him you were sure the item would be in Mr. Hunsecker's column in tomorrow's...
So what'll you do if I feel nervous? You'll open your meaty, sympathetic arms...?
Why me...?
No, I don't mind.  I'm busy too.
We stick in each others craw.
Do you think J.J. likes Steve...?
It's given me a big lift to know that some people want me for myself, not just because I'm my brother's sister.
No more you don't!  What is this - You're showing off for her?  They're supposed to hear you in Korea?
This is big, you know.  Very big! Let's go out later, drink some firewater.  With the boys.  Fred can call Millie and -
I just didn't think that I could antagonize him, Steve -- for OUR sake, I mean.
You going to work all day?
... but the output went to shit after three seconds.  I'm thinking now it's the way I'm matrixing the command hierarchies...
I can't
We should abort.
Look, whatever you want me to do, I'll do.  I just want my kids to have a chance to grow up, okay?
So this other guy?  He's a terminator too, right, like you?
Radical.
Like it could disguise itself as anything... a pack of cigarettes?
Well, why doesn't become a bomb or something to get me?
We spent a lot of time in Nicaragua... places like that.  For a while she was with this crazy ex-Green Beret guy, running guns.  Then there were some other guys.  She'd shack up with anybody she could learn from.  So then she could teach me how to be this great military leader.  Then she gets busted and it's like... sorry kid, your mom's a psycho.  Didn't you know?  It's like... everything I'd been brought up to believe was just made-up fantasy, right? I hated her for that.  But everything she said was true.  We gotta get her out of there.
Jesus... you were gonna kill that guy!
Now remember, you're not gonna kill anyone, right?
Everything.
Torque wrench please.
I guess, yeah --  Oh shit!!
This is tactically dangerous.
We don't have much time.
No shit?
Out of the way, John!
I got it.  Piece of cake.
John, get out of the way!!
I know, but I'm not as strong as I'm supposed to be.  I can't do it.  I'm screwing up the mission.
You broke my arm!
Can it be destroyed?
... it's... like a giant strobe light, burning right through my eyes... but somehow I can still see.  Look, you know the dream's the same every night, why do I have to --
Don't see me to my door, there's no need.
'Please remember that Dr. Furtwängler risked his life to help anyone who asked him. I personally testify to having seen literally hundreds of people lined up outside his dressing room after concerts to ask for his help. He never turned anyone away. After he heard me play... I am a violinist... he gave me money because I was unable to feed myself or my family and then he helped me to escape to Sweden. He helped countless people in similar ways.'
Where you from, David?
David, need to ask you something. You heard this rumour the British found something called the Hinkel Archive?
What's that mean?
Jeez. And you think the British'll share it with their Allies?
Can I ask you a favour, Major?
When you question him again, could you treat him with more respect?
Yes, I'm a Jew. But I like to think first I'm a human being.
So, Major, tell me, have you questioned Dr. Furtwängler?
A great artist will have great privileges in a Russian zone.
I'm gonna get that fucking bandleader, Colonel. No deal. No fucking deal.
You do shorthand and typing?
Could you tell us about being made a Prussian Privy Councillor. How did that happen to a non-Party member?
Your guess is as good as mine.
Why were they going to arrest you?
You were real close to all of them, to Adolf, to Hermann, to Joseph, to Baldur, and now Albert,  So, let's hear the truth, let's come clean. What was your Party number?
Yup, that's him, that's the guy. You know what else the little creep did? He kept files, close on 250,000 files. And you know what's in those files?
have no idea what ordinary people thought.
Come on, admit it. K worried you, didn't he? He always worried you. In 1942, he's thirty-four years old, you're already fifty-six. And Goebbels and Goering keep saying to you, 'If you don't do it, little K will.' Never mind art and politics and symbols and airy-fairy bullshit about liberty, humanity and justice because I don't care how great you are. It's the oldest story in the book,  The ageing Romeo jealous of the young buck. The real reason you didn't leave the country when you knew you should have was that you were frightened that, once you were out of the way, you'd be supplanted by the Miracle Kid, the Party's boy twice over, flashy, talented little K.
Stop this, please, stop this now!
I absolutely refused the house and the bomb shelter.
Do I know Hans Hinkel?
I hear the British have his... his archive, files, records.
It's Dr. Furtwängler's baton, which I stole.
Yes, you remember.
Great catch, kid. The boy runs off.
What?
Edwin von der Null. Music critic. He gave Furtwängler terrible reviews while he raved about Herbert von Karajan.
Oh! The evening before, I see...
So, you never heard of him.
No, I was never a Nazi, I have no interest in politics, I'm a musician -
I don't know.  I kinda had my heart set on being a cashier the rest of my life.
Here you go.  You're a Bob's Girl now.  Nancy will check you out.
The Uzi 9 millimeter.
What do you think?
Pay attention.  The 600 series had rubber skin. We spotted them easy.  But these are new.  They look human.  Sweat, bad breath, everything.  Very hard to spot.  I had to wait 'til he moved on you before I could zero him.
Kyle, what's it like when you go through time?
You volunteered?
I'm sure.
About what?
Bag some Z's?
Thanks a lot.
Look.  I found it.  Isn't that it?  Cyber Dynamics Corporation?
Kyle, the women in your time...what were they like?
I don't think I like this.
I see.  And this...computer, thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy, kill- ing him, in effect, before he is even conceived?  A sort of retroactive abortion?
...it had no choice. The defensive grid was smashed. We'd taken the mainframes... We'd won.  Taking out Connor then would make no difference.  Skynet had to wipe out his entire exist- ence.  We captured the lab complex.  Found the...what- ever it was called...the time-displacement equipment. The Terminator had already gone through.  They sent two of us to intercept, then zeroed the whole place. Sumner didn't make it.
You go naked.  Something about the field generated by a living organism.  Nothing dead will go.
Why were the other two women killed?
I can help you...
...look, Lieutenant...uh, Vukovich, don't put me on hold and don't transfer me to another department...
Call her.
You promised you'd meet projections, Alan.  A dollar sixty per share you said.  So, I don't think this is so surprising a visit.
Admittedly...
But, the expectation was ten.  And, in this case, expectation is everything.
My stock's falling.  Isn't yours? Those pennies are costing me millions.
Christine!   Mister Van Orton is a valued customer...
There's got to be a flashlight.
"... wait for help."  Wait for help. I'm not opening a door that specifically warns me not to.
You deserted me.
You're the one who started running.
That's classic.
A fresh shirt...
What is it?
Take the picture out.
You can talk while I drive us to the police.
Then, what good are you?
It wasn't his fault.  He thought it was his only way back.  They fleeced him real good.
What did you say?
What?
Where'd you get that... ?
He's got a gun.  Everyone, he's got a <u>real</u> gun up here!  Real situation!  ... damn it...
No, now wait... think about it.  What did you see... ?
Really?
Trust me.  Call that number.
Will you?
It doesn't matter...
It's them.  They did this.
How did those... ?
No!  You're one of them.  Of course, it makes perfect sense!
What?
What happened was, I'm on vacation, alone... I was robbed, at gunpoint. They hit me and ran.  Two men, a few blocks away.  They took my wallet, money... all of it.  So...
Yes.
I know, look at me, well...  What happened?  I don't know.  I don't even really know.  I have some things to try to take care of... I need the car a little while.
The last few days, um... I've been thinking... had a lot of spare time.  I want to tell you... I'm starting to understand why you left me.  I've been resenting you for it, maybe, but ... I want to apologize, for all of it.  For shutting you out, for not being there.  I...  Anyway, I hope you can forgive me.
I'll explain someday.
V-A-N... O-R-T-O-N...  A gift from Conrad Van Orton. Interesting...
Oh... it's a game.
May I make two suggestions... ?
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Goddamnit, why do they do that?
Tell them the cops are after you... tell them you've got to talk to someone, I'm threatening to blow the whistle.
Drive in.
Guess!
I need the police.
Your mother thought he was a good man.  He worked very hard.  What I remember most was his manner was so... slight.  It was easy to spend time in a room, and not realize he'd been there the whole time.
No.  What happened... no one expected it.
The Hinchberger wedding.
I'll send your regrets.  Honestly, why must I even bother?
Your ex-wife.
What gentleman, Maria?
What the fuck... ?!
Hey... !
Find out about a company called C.R.S.  Consumer Recreation Services.
Christ... I can't believe it... invisible ink?
Bravo, young man.  you have to tell me what this was all about sometime.  I want you to know... when it looked there for awhile like you were going slowly insane... I was fully prepared to have you committed to the <u>finest</u> mental-health facility available.  I mean that sincerely, don't thank me.
Do you need me anymore?  Cause I'm going to bed.  They can stay up talking another 45 minutes if they want, but I gotta try to get some sleep.
I didn't do it.
So could you!  Is this some fucked up idea of art, putting someone else's name to a painting?
Was sure she'd be in here.
Malcolm, this is essential work I'm doing.  Just think what my research can do for education. Elementary school classrooms near train tracks or airports, where loud noise is random; this helps to prove the need for sound insulation if the children are ever going to learn to read.
Why are you working with her? Mary Lambretta was thrown out of the department for trying to get a Ph.D. in psychic studies.
You don't believe in the paranormal.
You wrote that you had trouble sleeping.
The cold sensation.  Who felt it first?
All right...
Are you coming to confess?
But you told me to look in the paper!  You told me I'd be perfect!
No.
What's this?  What's this... this picture?
This is where we're going?
What happened?
Maybe they're Mary's.
Get a blanket!
She needs help.
Why do you need a chain like that?
It's a job.  I keep banker's hours.  I set dinner on the dining room sideboard at six.  You can serve yourselves.  Breakfast is ready at nine.  I don't wait on people.  I don't stay after dinner.  Not after it begins to get dark.  I leave before dark comes.  We live in town.  Nine miles.  So there won't be anyone around if you need help.  We couldn't even hear you, in the night.
That'd be seventy in New York. You stole it!
No.
David?
That's so sad.
I'm sorry I was mad at you, Theo.
I'm going to stay with you until you fall asleep.  And then I'm going to get some brandy.
They're all in here.  All the ones he killed.  They're just children! We have to help them!
What'd you come back for, babe?
Is it possible that you're too young to be acquainted with the idea of loyalty?
I've lived in L.A. all my life, I've never done this drive.
The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain majesty.
Hey.
Same as last time -- the rest after.
See, a successful man like me has limitations -- I lose touch at a street level.  So I have to depend on a smart boy like you who's closer to the nitty and the gritty than I am.
You should have let me do the talking.
As it happens.  I didn't make that part up.
No.  I mean.  Not even your people should be involved.  Right?  It's too close now.
You think I'm staying?
You broke last time.
I didn't even know who I was writing to -- just someone with the same last name. She never talked about any family.
I never said nothin' about nothin' like that.  No, no, no.  That's not what I wrote to you.
Not me, man.  I'm no drug dealer, what you think.
I already told you, man.  Corcoran.  Know what that is?  State prison.
You're kiddin' me, right?
He came in with Jenny to the restaurant where I work.  That's not where they met.
Told you you wouldn't be able to see through that gate.
Who'd you butcher at the house?
What?
That was one of them?
Valets.  What d'ya mean valets.  What is he, then, the Earl of fucking Doncaster?
What are we standing on?
What d'you say, Elaine?
I was gonna be in that Michael Mann movie, you know -- with Pacino and DeNiro.  Got three callbacks.
Didn't get it.
Here, are you always this sarky?
Said it went on for donkey's years.
Oh, it just ended, then.
She never told anyone else.  About the convict strain -- or is it stain?  No, I was privileged.  I was someone who helped Jenny efface her past.
The address Jenny gave me, that wasn't a prison, was it?
Do you even know who Terry Valentine is?
In what capacity are you employed by this Mr. Lindgren?
You don't believe it was a car accident.
How did you come to have my address? Found it, did you.  Among her things.
You don't seem bothered.
Oh, I was gonna say ...
You mean if they'd nabbed you before you actually broke and entered you would only have been charged with making a mess.
It didn't discourage you, though.
From pursuing your chosen profession.
Who remembers.
I don't believe it.
Only in the movies.
Not that I recall.
Dropped dead in the stalls in the Odeon, Muswell Hill.  Watching Doris Day.
There's one thing I don't understand.  The thing I don't understand ... is every motherfucking thing you're saying.
So what's your beef, pal?
He'd already grabbed more than his allotted cut.  Didn't think he'd be so bold as to take all of it.
So you wouldn't have any idea how your client continues to make so much fucking money.
Out on a oil rig.  In the North Sea. Nine years.
How much.
Two blacks and a Mexican in a car.  Who's driving?
What?
Like what.
I don't get it.
You know her?
Where is he, then?
Where's ... what's-his-name -- Fred --
In a couple of days this whole thing --
You must know Ian.
Anyway, uh... my point is you're young. A kid really, your whole life ahead of you. But it's not too soon to start thinking... to start making opportunities for yourself. Before it all washes away.
...I stank, didn't I?
You're an enthusiast.
...You are ze fahzer?
Is not so hard to understand. Her playing, very polite.
Well, it's the wildest goose there is. Risk money. Very speculative. Except, Ed, in certain situations, it's not, see? I thought I had a prospect here. Well, I make the haul up and this lousy so-and-so tells me his situation has changed--all his capital's gonna be tied up in expansion plans of his own. Thank you, mother! Pop goes another bubble! It's only the biggest business opportunity since Henry Ford and I can't seem to interest a soul!
...You bring a check?
Well, there it is. Writ large in legal escriture, next step is--
All right.
How ya doin', Ed?
Uh-huh.
Please, Ed.
...What a knucklehead.
Dave.
...I don't know what happened to Big Dave. I know some of it. Irregularities in my books, they said. Can I explain it.
I know all about that. But I don't know how much to tell them.
...Doris--
Good! That helps. Not that she didn't do it, that she didn't confess. Of course, there's ways to deal with a confession, but that's good!--one less thing to think about. Now. Interview. I'm seeing her tomorrow. You should be there. Three o'clock. One more thing: you keep your mouth shut. I get the lay of the land, I tell *you* what to say. No talking out of school. What's out of school? Everything's out of school. I do the talking; you keep your trap shut. I'm an attorney, you're a barber; you don't know anything. Understood?
How did you get into the store?
Not guilty, your honor...
...So, uh, who should I--
I don't work here. My wife does.
...Ed?
Russians exploded an A-bomb.
Jesus...
No, I mean it's growing, it's part of us. And we cut it off. And throw it away.
This is what family is for, Ed! This is when ya come together!
They're just people like you and me, Ed. Remember that.
'Lo, Ed.
Barber, right? I'm Freddy Riedenschneider. Hungry? They tell me the chow's OK here. I made some inquiries.
Hello!
Doesn't bother me.
I'm telling you, something's wrong. I still haven't heard from Pendergast.  I think you should call it off.
Sweet Jesus!
My office is on the third floor! There's a walk-in safe and a portable phone!  We can lock ourselves in the safe and call for help!
For Chrissake, I'll do it.  What's the combination?!
Fifteen... what's next?
An original Roger Tory Peterson of a Red-Breasted Merganser.  Amazing.  I have a copy of this in my office at home.
Yes.  That's my case.  Now it's yours. All the corpses were badly mutilated in a very particular way. Decapitated.  Brains extracted.  Limbs torn to shreds.  It looked like the work of a large animal, but there was no sign of an animal on board.
They heard the victim's name and wove him into their story.  Nice touch.
What happened to them?
Vince?  There's no way we can get to you with the fire doors down. There's an entrance to the sub- basement in the hall off the north side exit.
Nice to see you, Lieutenant.
This place is a maze.
Shouldn't a drug that powerful be destroyed?
I believe in you a hundred percent, Vince, but that's the second time we've been at that intersection.
Please.  Don't humiliate me further.
Yes it is.  I'm tired and I'm no longer needed --
Come on.  I'll walk you back to the elevator.
That Cuthbert.  What a piece of work. Someone's dead and all he cares about is his Superstition Exhibit.
With the intelligence of a human being, the speed of a greyhound, and the strength of a grizzly bear.
What's going on?
This means there must be an animal loose in the museum!
Margo, this is too dangerous.  You always think you can solve everything.  This time you don't have enough information.  The animal might behave in unexpected ways.  Leave her here with me.  Don't put her in danger.
Nothing.  I'm in third grade.  What's a revolutionary what ch'a ma' callit?
This room sucks.
It had a long tongue, teeth this big and yellow eyes.
They've got something.
Jesus, what is this?
Oh no.  I smell it.
I have the species identification on these teeth.  We can extract DNA and start running tests on the extrapolator program.  Call Dr. Frock.  He wanted a demonstration.
For once I'm glad you're rumor central.  What in the world is going on?
This is it.  This is what he, or it... is after!  The plant has high concentrations of the same hormones found in minute quantities in the human brain!
Pendergast told me the killer extracts and eats the hypothalamus and thalamus of the victim's brains!
Got to finish this thesis sometime.
Yes.  Once.  We met at Columbia.  John held the Cadwalader Chair in Statistical Paleontology when I was a grad student there.
No.  I'm all right.  I won't let this affect me anymore.  John wouldn't get help.  His ego endangered the lives of others.  His theory came first.
What happened?
They're all heavily armed.
Genetic damage?
Wounded?
Hide quickly!
What is it doing?
For what?
He has to look here or I won't get a clear shot.  Call him, Margo.
Where exactly?
<i>Where</i> in Fiji?  What island?
Viti Levu.  For how many?
I do have a fabulous rate on a cruise ship departing for Fiji tomorrow.  But you wouldn't want to do that.
You want to book the flight?
Close up?
I'm sure we'll get him on this next sweep.
Let's talk ratings.  "Truman" has always enjoyed top ten status but the huge surge over the last few days--how do you hope to sustain that audience now that Truman appears to have reconciled himself?
But recent events have been so dramatic, it does raise the perennial question. What keeps us watching this one man twenty-four hours a day - eating, sleeping, working, sitting for hours in contemplation?
He was curious from birth - premature by two weeks, as if he couldn't wait to get started.
We've learnt about life as Truman has and, despite the complaints of a minority, it's been an overwhelmingly positive experience, for Truman and for the viewing public.
Nothing was real.
Lauren, right?
It's okay.  I probably wouldn't talk to me either.
Actually, I'm free Sunday.
I'm thinking of getting out, Marlon.
It's not that simple.  Takes money, planning.  You can't just up and go.  Oh, I'm going to do it, don't worry about that.  I've just got to move slow.  Pick my moment.  Bonus time's just around the corner.  Soon as I finish the...
I think I'm mixed up in something.
It's hard to tell.  They look just like regular people.
Could be.  Beard looks phony.  It's when I'm unpredictable.  They can't stand that.  That's why we've got to get out of here.  Can you come with me?
I don't know what to think, Marlon. Maybe I'm going out of my mind, but I get the feeling that the world revolves around me somehow.
Not the whole thing, Truman.  You were right about one thing.
Well, what do you think?
Oh, God.
Come on, Truman.  Haven't you studied enough?
I'll take you home, Angela.  Why don't you leave those with us for a while?
--you're a nurse, aren't you?
Blocked at every turn.  Beautifully synchronized, don't you agree?
Truman, that was our house!
It's hard to go places, isn't it?
Stop this now.  I'll do it.  I swear.
No.  You said, "Do something."  Who were you talking to?  Tell me!
How are you, Mother?
It doesn't sound insane, Truman.  I swear I see him ten times a week--in a hundred faces.  I almost hugged a perfect stranger in the salon last Thursday.
Now what?
They're going to stop me talking to you.
--It doesn't matter.  Everybody knows about it.  They know everything you do. The point is, you got scared.
How's it going, Truman?
Why don't you go home to the old lady --
-- those are very serious allegations, Agent Scully --
You've got something to show me.
Who called this meeting?
Who?
You said you knew the location of the archeological site where these were found.
How's that?
The Federal Building was too well guarded.
What was it?
What do you think?
That would be my guess.
I know that. But the threat was called in for the Federal Building across the street.
Mulder...?
Now what?
Alright... what'll it be: Coke, Pepsi? A saline IV?
Whatever you told them in there, you don't have to protect me.
Go home, Mulder. It's late.
Mulder -- what are you doing?
And there's been no autopsy performed. There's no Y incision here; no internal exam.
Why are you whispering?
How was it contracted?
He didn't mention a park.
Ground's dry about an inch down. Somebody just laid this down. Very recently, I'd say.
That bomb in Dallas was allowed to go off, to hide something: bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself.
You hear that?
Why was I assigned to you? To debunk your work. To reign you in. To shut you down.
Scully...
We've got to keep moving.
Agent Mulder -- we both know that if you and Agent Scully hadn't taken the initiative to search the adjacent building, you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred --
I know.  Agent Scully reported your suspicions to OPR. On the basis of her report, I sent techs over to S.A.C. Michaud's apartment. They picked up PSTN residues on his personal effects consistent with the construction of the vending machine device in Dallas.
Are we being watched?
Where's Scully?
What is it?
You're lying.
But... he sacrificed his own daughter. My sister, Samantha.
Where is he?
Let me out. Stop the car.
The vaccine you hold is the only defense against the virus. Its introduction into an alien environment may have the power to destroy the delicate plans we've so assiduously protected for the last fifty years.  Or it may not.
Sing a song of sixpence...
"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman, Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
He hates me.
It could take years for me to get past the barriers he's created.
Nothing.
Catherine?  I'm about to start.  If you want me to wait, or...
This man is deeply disturbed, he...
Absolutely.  I suppose everyone does.
Why'd you bring him here?
What about Julia?
What happened?
Wait...
He wants us to follow.  The little boy...
Well look at that.
He's mine?
They're hungry.
Who says?
Shouldn't we get a catheter in him?
Intravenous administration complete.
That's why we monitor the use of the drugs so closely.  We don't want her getting to that degree of perceptual disorientation.
Into Stargher.  Inside...
I have to ask you some things... Are you taking any prescription drugs?
What about narcotics?
I know your partner's here, but it's very important that you're honest.
How's the patient.
Someone looking after her little girl?
After three years she remembers what the guy drove?
Why jeopardize what we've already done? We caught the sonofabitch.  Carl Stargher.  That's going to be like Bundy, Gacy, Dahmer.  A case that makes careers.  But if we push our luck.  If this is all bullshit and we come out smelling like it.
Thank you.
You were in love with him, weren't you?
His own doctor?
Drink?
Might as well I suppose. Are you busy?
Can I hear you?
I can try. Is it comedy, or tragedy?
...to steal my girl.
I wish I knew.
I thought you were going to go away. Aren't the police after you?
...you know.
Here, it will be cold on that train.
What is going to happen? Where is Harry?
How do you know?
...quarrel?
...anyway?
...parents.
You know as much as I do, Miss Schmidt - you were intimate with Lime, weren't you?
He works in a military hospital.
In one of his letters he asked you to telephone - a good friend of his called Joseph. He gave you the number of the Casanova Club. That is where a lot of friends of Lime used to go.
Joseph Harbin's body was found in the coffin.
Miss Schmidt, we know he is somewhere across the canal in the Russian sector... You may as well help us. In a few minutes Colonel Brodsky will be questioning you about your papers. Tell me where Lime is.
I would very much like to meet you, Baron. Come around.
How will I know you?
...Austrian Police Headquarters.
My name is Calloway.
See much of him before that?
Him dying like that.
...policemen. I have to call them sheriffs.
Why don't you catch a few murderers for a change?
...expense.
What do you want to see a doctor for, huh?
Well?
...be responsible for you in the streets.
Calloway, can't you do something about Anna?
They wouldn't know me.
What's that?
Mr. Crabbin.
Hello, Harry.
Listen, Harry - I didn't believe that...
Hmm.
...exactly who did you tell about me? Hmm?
Well, I've got quite a lot on my mind.
Do you expect me to give myself up?
Mr. Martins. Delighted to meet you. Come let's sit down here. Ober! Zwei. What would you like. Tea? Coffee?
We came out of his place like this, and were walking this way. A friend of his called to him from over there. Harry went across and from up there came the truck. It was just about here.
Well, there was only you, and this friend of his. Who is he?
Are you mad?
Did you know Mr. Lime well?
Happened...Yes happened right down there.
You don't know it was an accident. You only saw a dead man and three men carry him.
Oh, you did.
I'm Daffy.
If you could see your way to lending me some cash -
What are you doing in Thailand? Tourist?
Everyone ok?
So from there to there?
I think so too.
You realize that in the eternity of space, there is a planet, just like this one, where you are photographing back towards us. You're photographing yourself.
Exactly. Always happened to someone else.
Watch your language....
Read the early Zionists on European Jewry; they sound like Goebbels.
Fucking Danny, man...
Didn't you see <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>?
Bring your friends.... We're not his friends.
You coming?
Oh, please...
What do you care?
How come you know all this shit?
Yeah, but not on the letters.
You write that?  Come work for me. You've got a lot to learn; I can teach it to you.
No, they don't. Not the smart ones.  Look, I'll give you five grand if you can document your tax-exempt status.... But when you fall off this horse, come see me. I can show you how to make a lot of money.
Which is what?
I bet. He didn't realize that nobody who talks such a good game ever plays one.
Where'd you get this?
Put something on. You're not supposed to be naked in front of it.
Who gets contaminated, the Jews or the gentiles?
Payn tash-chiton v'ashiytem...
Christianity's silly, but at least there's something to believe in. Or not believe. Judaism there's nothing.
Why should I submit?
Nazis talk about it all the time.
Believe me, Adolf Hitler couldn't possibly have hated the Jews as much as I do. Not in a billion years. You know why?
You can't. Do you know how many people I've brought into...the movement...?
He commands it whether He exists or not...  Look, we can fight him and be crushed. Or we can submit.
Look, just light the candles with me. Then we'll eat. You have to eat.
Miriam called, looking for you. She said you might come, so I...
I didn't notice his shoes.... Did your mother know he was there?
Danny, the night we met, you said the name Ilio Manzetti. We were impressed. We were excited. But here it is September, and Mr. Manzetti is still walking around breathing the air.
...Insulting people who were in the camps. ...What's the point?
I'm trying to figure out where the radical right is going to next....I thought you were the most interesting person at that meeting.
The other night you said the modern world is a Jewish disease. Could you elaborate on that?
Let me give you an example.... Sexuality.
Did you ever fuck one, Guy?
Yes. It's very pleasurable. But the Jews are obsessed with it. You know why?
You're not listening. He isn't better. He gives pleasure, but that's actually a weakness.
Let's just say I've done due diligence.
Who? How would I know him?
Why would Nadelman lie?
Give me a reason not to.
It's too late.... If I didn't, somebody else would.  Yom Kippur starts at sundown. Will you go to synagogue?
No!
Lina Moebius. And you are...?
Are you with the FBI, Mr. Balint?... Or any other law enforcement agency?
But you already talked about it: you said it's not stupid. Why isn't it stupid?
Ah, Jesus Christ, Danny, how can you wear that thing?... You know what it means? To your people...
Tell it to Hitler.
Is this because of those kids who used to beat you up?
The Polacks? From Sacred Heart?
What about Drake, did he ever show up?
Didn't you get anything?
Not too fast.
The Manzetti thing must have scared her. She thinks she'll get implicated.
When do you want it to go off?
Jeez, it's been since, what, Kenny's wedding.
She's at Yale Law -- interning with the district attorney...  We're getting married next spring. In Israel.
Danny, listen, people expect me to daven; they don't want someone they don't know -- leading their prayers.
And what did you do?
SO THEY SHOT HIM! SO HE WAS DEAD. SO WHAT. HE'S WORSE THAN DEAD NOW. HE'S A PIECE OF SHIT...
After your mother died, that's when you stopped going to shul. Doing your homework. Everything.
There's some maple walnut in the freezer.
We want you to help run it. Give speeches, lead seminars... Handle the fund-raising.
...May you be blessed in your going forth as you were in your coming....
...You're saying that when he first appeared at your house, you had no idea he was Jewish....
The papers are going to report tomorrow that your colleague, Curtis Zampf, has been a federal informant for the past two years. Do you believe that?
I think, he's really nice... He's a funny guy... sometimes even very moving.
And you...?  Do you love Enzo?
Johana, am I boring you?
Listen, I just found out we've got real problems in Sicily!
What's happened??
You're right.  You're fired.
He seems to have won it.
This is a great pleasure.
A new world record!  That's great! It gives me something to beat tomorrow!  You ever been to Tahiti?
And the lights!  Running lights, stealing stretchers...!  You'll have us in jail.
You risk your life when you cross the street.
... What's your name again?
Why?
You're the best, Enzo!
I don't have one.
Enzo?
Why?  Are they what's most important?
No, I have to ask you a favor...  You're the only one who'll understand.
Good night.
Can I come in?
You'd rather think about it and make yourself miserable?
That's good.
I'm concentrating.
Tea... or whiskey?
Thanks for helping with the bag.  It looks great!
Yes... Maybe... I don't know.  I don't like competitions... It ruins the fun.  Don't you think?
You jumped in?
Jacques, you set a world record.
How are you?
So have I.  ... Hello?
Do you know how it is?  Do you know what you're supposed to do to meet a mermaid?
What's wrong?
Uncle Louis, you remember Enzo's mother Signora Molinari from Amorgos?
... And the new stereo.
It's his heartbeat.
... Since eight o'clock last night...!  You're in love.
... And if we repaint the walls, we'll need new curtains, you put the painters on you Visa and I'll do the curtains on American Express... for the couch there's Bloomingdales...  or are you still over your limit?
Does that have a hidden meaning?
You look it too.  You haven't been working out, you haven't been taking your vitamins!  You haven't been drinking your herbs, you haven't been...
So why the long face?
Any sign of Santa?
So, now what?
Sorry. I'm better with men.
Your mother was right. You do work too hard.
I don't want to argue with you. Let's just eat in peace.
...and the opportunity to help my brothers and sisters in the Jewish community.
...and their children will all be able to eat latkes and spin dreidels, and light the menorah with the knowl...
Okay, what's the information?
What's wrong with him?
How do we bypass it?
Hey everybody. How's it hangin'?
I shlepped all the way to the North Pole for this? I come to fight you, and you don't even put out anything to nosh on? What kind of arch nemesis are you?
Maybe I should just forget all about money - - forget about mamma and the kids and the rent, huh - marry some poor dope like -- oh, like Carlos Dominguez - - and get fat and -
Why do you ask so many questions? What difference does it make how Carlos and I feel? Feeling does not buy clothes and houses!
Sure, I like my leopards
Sure!
I want him to lock me up.
) They buried Teresa today and they were hunting the leopard again -- out in the country this time. But they didn't get him.
Well -- did he give you a lot of money?
See you tomorrow -
He will be waiting...
Pedro is waiting for me, too.
Show business?
Yes. I want to go out and patrol the town - be everywhere at once - be sure nothing happens to anybody.
You know about animals -- their habits -- will it come back?
Doc -- something you said the other day --
Charlie and I were talking. That's one reason I wanted to see you.
You must admit it's possible that it might have been a man.
To the eye? Like other men.
He'd act normally when he was with other people. It would be a man who suffered remorse and even pity when it was all over.
Tell me.
Then you found the leopard --
Jerry told me you were an expert with animals, Mr. Galbraith. Couldn't you tell where it went?
Wait 
I haven't done any posse work since last time I rode with Toni Mix at the old Bijou Theatre -- aged six, If you're interested,
I've been trying to tell him, Sheriff. He won't listen to me.
State hunters?
That's a fact, isn't it?
On his back, I suppose.
You're too good to me.
Get it out of here!
You look swell in that threealarm number --
I suppose he was trying to make me feel bad.
	As long as my feet held out.
Pretty. You know -- it's funny but flowers only mean one thing to me now.
Why do you want to stay around here? It'll only make you feel badly.
You already know the answer to that. I want this town to be safe and happy again --
I got into a little crap game.
It's a lovely town - it was until we came and let the leopard loose and all this happened.
Is that why your brother braved coming here to ask you for a loan?
For your information, Mr Lombard, trouble is possibly the one thing Leon is capable of getting into all by himself. Though I doubt he will not ultimately fail even at that.
Oh-oh! Touché, Mr Lombard! But tell me, what would you know about sisterly love, eh?  No. Dont. You might get confused speaking of things you dont understand and we need you clear- headed, at least until youve done what we are paying you for.
No. The question now is how long its going to take you to get out of here, Mr Lombard.
Get out of my house. Youre fired, Mr Lombard.
Huh! Who do you think we are, Mr Lombard?
Im impressed. That information could have cost me £20,000.
Are we understood?
I... Well, were burying Leon tomorrow and... Look, I wish I had more time, but its late and with the funeral...
Or is it the other way round? The children are needed because you cant satisfy him?
Whatever the reason, Im sorry I did. Goodbye, Mr Lombard. I believe you know your way out.
I dont.
Is there anything to understand?
What happened? Adonis slapped you about a little and you reverted to cowardice?
Perhaps it came to me while dying in a Californian desert because a woman set upon giving her husband a fright got slapped about a little.
You know something? Ive just seen so much ugliness I dont think Id mind four walls and dinner served every night at a regular time.  Id hoped to have a private word with Adonis, but if thats the way you want it.
Do you think wed let him get away with the murder of my brother?
They found his body yesterday. In the pool at our house in Sao Paulo. He drowned. Drank too much, went for a swim and drowned.
So you did talk about it, huh?
Theres nothing wrong with the line, sir. Are you sure you have the right number? 770 471 is the number of a call box.
Okay. The woman just cant walk away...  I want straight answers. No hesitation or I walk for sure. Why cant you go to your Embassy?
Where were you staying before the attempt on your life and why cant you go back there?
By your Austrian?
A recent acquisition. Weve had four break- ins this year alone; files stolen, computers wrecked, faeces smeared on walls. The good guys dismiss us as alarmist do-gooders; the bad guys will risk prison to intimidate and rob us. An easy living indeed, Mr Lombard.  I got through to Moreau and Jane. I left your landlord out of it. Your flats been broken into. Jane wants you to call her back.
Right... Well, Ill get your money first thing in the morning, okay?  Okay. Goodnight then.
Call from the motel and tell him if he moves fast enough there might be something left of a body dissolving in acid.  Can I have the keys to your house?
Whitney Armstrong, my deputy. What Whitneys trying to say is that you might not live to tell the tale next time you meet your Austrian...
Look at him, Whitney. Come all the way from England to clean up California. Huh!
Shit! Fuck! Whats fucking wrong with people!  Im going to bed. And sweet dreams to you to!
Who are you?
Where?
There were six on offer, you scumbag. Where are the other five?
How many of you scumbags are here?
What colour is your car?  What colour is your car?
Im sorry but Mr Gluck is not answering, sir.  Would you like to leave a message?
You sure you passed on my message?
Hello again, neighbour. I didnt intrude, did I?
I dont know. How many famous French film directors can there be?
Oh... We split up.
Carlos De Moraes?
May I...?
Whatever, you come recommended. We...
I didnt mean to imply you did, Mrs Spitz.
The rooms yours for 24 hours. Its sound- proofed, stocked up with food, drink and other things you might find useful. You can do anything you like.
Friedman lives with you at the Ambassador?
This car needs petrol.
Only feeding the disease, eh, Martin?
Maybe I dont.
Im overcome by your public-spiritedness.
You seem very sure about that.
What is?
Its about the puppy. You got the money?
And while visiting our fair city you...  An Austrian?
An Austrian... Not much to go on, is it?
Whats a French private investigator doing here?
He just said he had good reasons.
Is she on the phone?
I cant think of a good reason for it - for now anyway. My number if anything happens. Whats your sisters number?
The money Leon left for the boy, was it cash?
You sure? What about before he turned up with the boy?
Los Angeles is 100 miles away.
Whats an hour of your time worth these days, Nathalie?  Combien, Nathalie!
Jai bien peur quil te faudra attendre.  Pas avant la matinée.
Alors?
Three...
Youre the lantern man, huh?  If you wanna see whats left of him...
Are you telling me Friedman didnt tell you I was here looking for him?
So you killed him and went to clean out his hotel room... How did Friedman say he got to know where to find me?
Not even scum like Friedman would go to the trouble of killing a stranger on the strength of one anonymous call.
Are they still operative?
Mossad?
What do you mean?
Why not you -- Jean d'Aulon?  The only man who's poorer than I am, and so the only man I can trust. Dignified, honorable, wise... what more could we ask of a king?
I would like some fresh straw.
Yes.  I didn't confess today.
I shall also be needing a war horse -- mine is too slow -- and armor -- and a good sword -- and an artist to make me a banner.
I also need someone who can read and write.
Not so... easily.  Why aren't you... fighting...?  go on... we're almost there...
They've abandoned me... like everyone.
Well of course they're me!  That's how God talks to me.  If you listen hard enough, even you can hear him. Everyone can hear him.
All you have to do is stop talking and just listen.
If you really want to help me, there's one thing you can do.
I am ready now...
One day you will.
We have to press home the attack!
Why?
Yes, probably... maybe...
It is the sacred place that matters, Charles -- not the size.  Am I correct, Bishop?
But if this trial seems fixed, I fear you'll have the very opposite result to the one you want...
It is not for us to burn her, my lord.  That is your prerogative.
But we can't do that unless she admits to blasphemy...
Dead you're worthless, darling.
Quick -- hide in here...
But... the King -- my king -- didn't he pay my ransom?
So... begin by telling us your name -- assuming you're allowed to tell us that much?
What did it tell you?
Let me clarify things for you, Jeanne.  On the one hand there is the Church Triumphant, that is to say God, his saints, and the souls that are saved.  And then there is the Church Militant, that is to say our Holy Father the Pope, the cardinals, the prelates of the Church, the clergy, and all good Catholic Christians.  Moreover this Church, when assembled, is guided by the Holy Spirit and therefore cannot be in error.  That is why we ask you to submit to the Church Militant... that is to say, us.
Sign this, and I will confess you myself if you want.
Your health and happiness has always been my first concern, Charles... ever since you were a little boy -- and I think I know you better than your own mother...
It's true.  There's only one king... people need to be reminded of that. Nevertheless... Jeanne has done so much for us...
... and what... what did he say?
So how would you put it?
Your majesty, I urge you not to see this woman.  It all reeks of a Burgundian trap!
I... I don't know... it'll sound like we... betrayed her...?
When you saw your king for the first time, was there an angel over his head?
8,000.  We can't raise more... We can only place ourselves at the mercy of your generosity.
Position the long-bows over there, crossbows over there -- and set up Dijon Culverins either side of those trees...
Jeanne, what are you doing with that... you've got it back to front...
This is no good!
And... what does Jeanne think?
We return to Orleans... across the bridge, at the Tourelles.
Jeanne... that is not ten thousand reinforcements -- that is one hundred very loyal but very tired soldiers.
You also cut your hair short like a man, and in the Bible it clearly states that it is an abomination for a woman to pretend to be a man!  It proves your desire to deceive...
So you think you did well to cut your hair and dress as a man?
But will you also submit to the decision of the Church?
Did your voice tell you to jump?
How can you deny it when you just said "I'd rather die than fall into the hands of the English"...?
You mean it was not of your own free will that you were on the ledge?
Jeanne, let me introduce the king's half brother, the dogged Lord Dunois.
What happened?  Who gave the order to attack?
Physicians are a waste of time. You'll have more luck with this charm of mine... it saved my life at Agincourt!
Prepare these as battering-rams!
You call this... glory...?  All this... this blood... this smell of...
Take mine instead -- here -- smash mine first!
When you were taken prisoner at Compiegne, did you have a horse?
Who gave you that horse?
Still, pretty wealthy for a peasant girl wouldn't you say?
I don't know... please... tell me I'm dead...
I... I'm leaving... I can't take anymore...
No, no, you did fine.  I'd even say well done.  Besides, most of the ones you killed probably deserved it, don't you think?
Yes...
I saw a poor monk without shoes so I gave him some.
They weren't my shoes.  Mine were too small.
My father's.
I'm sorry, Mr Wladek, he wants you to stop.
Why are you here, Mr. Wladek?
This is my husband. Wladyslaw Szpilman. Marek Gebczynski sent him.
I'm going to get a doctor.
Who are you?
Oh, Mr Szpilman, you're quite... quite wonderful.
Sit.
How long have you been married?
To tell you the truth, I thought it would be worse.
The Gestapo found our weapons. They've arrested Janina and Andrzej. They're bound to find out about this place, too - you must get away at once.
Have you seen this?
Can you help?
We're recruiting.
Don't be clever with me, Henryk. I've come here as a friend. They're bringing Jews in from all over the country. Soon there'll be half a million people in the ghetto. We need more Jewish police...
Yes, I'm looking at you and that's why I'm here. Your whole family can have a better life. You want to go on struggling for survival, selling books on the street?
Mama, that was a great dinner.
A good place for what?  He's insane!
You sell anything?
I know.
You go to Heller, did I ask you to talk to him?
What did you pay him?
Ah, here. Today's news from the other side.
No, I'm a socialist. I have brothers everywhere. They bring me news and food. We care about our fellow human beings. Workers of the world unite.
The Germans are advancing on Kharkhov.
I thought you'd be off on tour, playing London, Paris, New York?
If I play like an angel, why don't you listen?
How long have you been here?
Have a favour to ask. I want to get out of here.
Szpilman.
Watch your feet!
I can't imagine a fate worse than being dumb. Turn around.
Ohhh, it's so dark, it's like a dank cave.
I knew she was mute, but now I'm thinking it's more than that. I'm wondering if she's not brain affected.
No, it was a table.
Oh, yes, yes of course, a concern.
He is quite altered, as if they had been trying some native witchcraft on him. Well tomorrow or the day after he will be gone.
Which mountains are those dear?
Those 80 acres, that cross the stream, what do you think of them?
I don't think you should have given up the piano. I will make sure you are properly taught, with music written on to sheets and...
You don't want to learn.
And what does this do to our bargain? I cannot afford the piano if you mean me to pay.
She has spoken to me. I heard her voice. There was no sound, but I beard it here . Her voice was there in my head. I watched her lips, they did not make the words, yet the harder I listened the clearer I heard her, as clear as I hear you, as dear as I hear my own voice.
No, but her words are in my head.  I know what you think, that it's a trick, that I'm making it up. No, the words I heard, were her words.
Please take us to the beach where we landed.
She wants it to come.
I know why Mr. Baines can't play the piano.
He's given it to us.
Nobody.  I just know what kinda women he likes.  I'm gonna check all the joyhouses till I find him.
Visitation is still up by two at the three-quarters.  Single Action second, Fasanella third.
Sorry, pal.  I'll fix you up, call you a doc, but I ain't gonna walk into a bunch of knives for ya.
Paltrow, Sterling, Furey, and the Big Alabama are in from New Orleans. Fiskin and the Boone Kid from Denver, and Phillips, Barnett and Limehouse Chappie from New York. Those and the guys outside should give ya 30 or so to choose from.
How much did ya lose?
...It's the only reason I ain't quit before now.
Aw hell, you sound like some goddamn sucker.  You know everything I know.  You got nothin' more to learn from me.
We'll put Salino on it.  I need somebody careful.
Then why ain't he dead?
And tell Cole I wanta see him when he gets in.
Buck Duff.  I was in Maxwell's boost in Troy.
Doyle, can I see you a minute?
We got word from Chicago.  They got one of the grifters last night. The nigger.
I know I give him four threes.  We can't let him get away with that.
Looks all right.  It's big enough and off the street.
Glad to meet ya, kid.  You're a real horse's ass.
I'm sorry about Luther.  He was the best street worker I ever saw.
Gondorff, you gonna teach me the Big Con or not?
You know, somebody tailin' ya.  A torpedo or somethin'.
And?
Then he drove me home.  He tried to put himself away as legit, so I went right into the pitch.
No.
Well you found him again and we're gonna have to do somethin' about it. What else haven't ya been tellin' me?
Then why'd ya move outa your room?
What's the matter, kid?  You're not sayin' much.
The porters say he runs a braced card game in one of the cars.  $100 minimum, straight poker.  Last time he pulled in here ten grand heavier than he left New York.
We'll use the wire.  Never known a gambler who wouldn't like to beat the ponies.
What's the problem?
Lonnegan's a fast egg, Henry.  He's not gonna sit still for a standard play.
He usually plays with a Royal or a Cadenza.  I got you one of each.  He likes to cold deck low, 8's or 9's.
Yeh, that'd be real nice of ya, Mr. Lonneman.
Raise 1,000.
Never get enough, huh pal?  I'd think you'd get tired of losin', Honnigan.
A half mill on an eight to one shot. You're dumber than I thought, Lonnegan.
Hi there, Snyder.  Things a little slow down at the Bunco Department tonight, eh?  Somebody lose the dominoes?
Not intentionally maybe, but that don't make no difference to Lonnegan. He'll swat you like any fly.
Thank you.  You don't know how much I appreciate this.
Look, I don't have time to fuck around.  There's somebody out there I don't need to see.  You got a fire escape or anything?
All right, do me a favor.  Go into the bathroom, open the window and wait for me there.
I thought it might be good for him to see the setup.
Hooker!
Ain't seen you in months, boy. Thought maybe you took a fall.
Your boss is quite a card player, Carver.  How does he do it?
So could Shaw.
'Cause it's better to do it all at once.  We're puttin' down 400 grand next week.  At 5-1 we make 2 million. Twenty per cent of that is yours if ya stick with us.
You got the 400 grand yet?
You've already done time twice, and judges don't like three time losers. You wanna sit in the can for forty years, startin' tonight?
On a 6-1 shot?  The hell with ya. We'll keep the deal we got.
Take it easy.  Everything's all right.  I put it on Syphon, on the nose.
What is this?  I got work to do.
There's word he's gonna run a con on the North Side here.  We got a year-old Florida warrant on him, but it's a thin beef, and he can beat it in court unless we catch him cold.  All we want you to do is pick up Hooker for us.
Cause the stoolies are used to street dicks jumpin' him.  If word gets around that Feds are in on it too, Gondorff'll fold up the whole thing.
He's gonna set up Gondorff for us.
What's your next step, Nick?
What's the matter, darling ... not sweet enough?
What could happen to him, darling? You mustn't worry....  What is it?
Now don't say that -- he's just off somewhere working.
You're sweet, but the only thing that you can do for me is to go.
You don't understand.  You don't know what's going to happen.
Why not? I am crazy....the whole family's crazy.
That isn't true.  It was about your father.  Where is he?
Did it ever occur to you that Chris might work?
You took that money from Julia's hand.
Then what are you hiding?
Mother!
Did he tell you where he was going?
You know, we know each other.
Your father?
How do you do?  I'm sorry we have to rush.
You heard about Julia Wolf?
There.
She... she fell over backwards.
Hello, Dorothy.
He'll still be your son-in-law!
How's your brother?
Not at all.
Why not? You had a perfectly good motive.
Well, I've got my alibi.  I was at the Public Library.  Where were you?
Yes.  I might not have been shot.
I never saw him before.
So would I.
Trail him!  Trail who?
Shut up.
When was the last time you gave her money for Wynant?
I said he hadn't written me.
You say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it 'til we came?
Did you see anything in Miss Wolfe's hand?
Do you think that Wynant did it?
I think we may as well sit down.
She drives me nuts.  She's been ragging me all day.
I can't remember offhand, Lieutenant.  Maybe I was over at Charlie's shooting pool. Maybe I was here.  She'd remember.
I'll get some.
The government bonds.  The ones you took from the office safe.
I want that money right now, or I'll hand you over to the police.
Is there a Mr. Macaulay in the house?  Oh, it's you.
Asta - don't bother Mr. Macaulay.
Isn't there anything else I can do for you? Have you bought your ticket?
I see.  I see.
Clyde Wynant's crazy... absolutely crazy to stay away at a time like this. No wonder the police think he has something to do with it.
Dorothy!  Is she here?
But he has nothing to do with it!
You did... where?
It isn't a story - it's true.  I did see Wynant.  He's not dead.
All right - you didn't.
Why tell me?
He's dragged me into every gin mill on the block.
I thought so.  He even tried to drag me into the gentlemen's --
Who is she?
By the way, how is your father's side?
I'd better order some food.  That sounds like an interesting case.  Wouldn't you like to take it?
Good. I want to talk to you.
No.
That poor girl is in a tough spot.
What are you going to give me?  I hope I don't like it.
You idiot!  Asta! Stop that!  Get down!  Now, stay there.
On it!  I'm in it ... They think I did it!
Hello... send him up.
Well, that's that.  Stay there, Nick!
What's the trouble, Asta?  Your balloon busted?  So's mine.
Why don't you?
I wish they'd stop that.  It makes me fidgety. Do you think they'll find him, Nick?  He must be in New York....  Where do you think you're going?
What's that?  What are you up to?  Nickie - what is this?
Why shouldn't be close it? He went away.
You mean, he might be hiding there?
Go on - go on - see if I care. But it's a dirty trick bringing me all the way to New York just to make me a widow.
I want you to stay and find Wynant.
Nick!
But they all said it was Rosebreen's.
Nick, you'll drive me crazy.  What things?
Then he couldn't have committed those other murders.
Now Nick, what's that got to do with it?
Who do you think did it?
I hope you're well.
Well, that's a hot one.  You a bookkeeper!  When were you ever a bookkeeper?
Trying to put it off on her?
Was he a good detective?
I'm sorry...  but...
You're out of your minds, you know that? Both of you.  You don't even know if there's anything out there.  What the hell are you thinking?
What?
Why, yes, Jaeger.  I believe it is.
They stopped.
They shouldn't have been here.
What are you doing.
Maybe we are crazy for doing this.  But if we do it, we do it right.  I just needed to explain that in a way I wouldn't have to do it again.
Should have blown already.  Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff.
All right.  Let's get out of here.
Not much of a pass.
Missile!
All right.  Let's break out some utility shovels, lanterns, and a claymore in case we have to do any blasting.  Me and Jaeger'll climb down, and see what we can see.
What happened?
I'm not going to let you kill him.
Without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge.
You know what?  I think you got Schwarzkopf.  You did!  You got the General right in the ass.  Now that's good shooting.
Yeah, the deed to the Brooklyn bridge.
I think you've got some issues to deal with.  Really, when we get out of here I'm pretty sure it's shrink time for you.
I said nobody dies.  Nobody dies.
You're going to be fine.
They're doing more than slapping.
X marks the spot.
They're going to kill us!
A whole lot of nothing.
What?
He's not going to leave us.
They'll ask questions; want to know why we were out here.
First Wes, now you?
I'm sorry about that, Epps.
Really, I'm not.  Remember how I was talking I wanted to blow away all those Iraqis?  That's all it was was talk.  I was scared out of my mind to go to war. I still haven't gotten over stepping on that land mine.
Just let me rest for a second.
You know what I'm going to do?  I'm just going to take a second.  I want to look at the gold.
What did you say?
Oh, God...
An Iraqi?
What do we do?
What do we do?
Damn it.  We lost the horses.
Well?
Yeah.  Even after that.  You didn't take it out on me, except for maybe making me lie in the middle of the road now.  But I'd say you've been very fair.  I just think it's a hell of a man who can keep from going money simple.
Epps?
Still am.  There's more gold than I thought, and since there's only two of us now...  Where should I go?
I'd go to Australia.  Lot of land, not many people.  I think after this I'd like to quit people for awhile.  And the girls go crazy for brothers down there.
Epps, I don't think he's slowing down.
That shouldn't be too hard to read.  Iraq is the pink thing.
Ready for what?  Sight-seeing?
Yes.  Yes.  That's exactly it.  Yes.
What does that mean?
He says it's a box.
It's a puzzle box.  If you can figure out how to open it there's supposed to be a treasure inside.
Jaeger?
We're going to war, aren't we.  If they're doing all that it must mean we're going to war.
You ever think about it?  You ever worry?
God!  I don't believe I'm doing this.  I don't.
We're going to get court martialed, you know that.
Epps, is that a sand dune.
Yeah.  If.  Whatever.  What kind you figure it is?
Yeah!  Gold!  How much?
This is too much.  You don't even have the money and you're wasting it.
Maybe we ought to...you know, bury him. Say some words over him.
I can't hear him.
Birth born....UMMM...Sexact.
I'm not hungry.
I've never been under the table before.
That's not dirt...Can't be dirt.. Dirt is a violation.
Now...now, I'm sorry...don't - don't....please.  It's just... I was happy.  Why get me involved? You told SEN that you weren't satisfied with me.
Three!  I'm going to be late for my shift.
You slipped on a T297 transfer just before lunch, didn't you?
Are you all right?
They're watching us now.
THX!
What?
He's coming back for the rest of us.  He can't make it alone.
We must escape.  We have plans. We can leave.  We must wait until...
Right now.
What was that....
That's not it.
You don't know that!
Just look at all those people.
f 2600 block of Lakefront. A limousine. But, I-
Where did you get this?
High-grade det cord. This girl, either she's got strange taste in jewelry or she's into serious demolition.
Sorry about that.  That's an inch of the stuff, imagine what the whole thing'd do.
Treat. We treat devices.
Nice performance back there. Where'd you learn that, Mike Ditka Sensitivity Seminar?
No you look, mister! First, you don't go calling my men names. It's bad for morale. Second, us "punks" happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did.
The place has already be combed. Forensics pulled over a hundred sets of prints inside.
Redstone's the army training center in Alabama where they send the cream of the crop to learn about tickers.
Top of my class at West Point, thank you very much. Then off to Redstone. First half of the course we learned how to build devices... second half, we'd take them apart. Everything from firecrackers to hydrogen bombs.
Nitro-cellulose. What is that, some kind of explosive?
What's up?
Should we head for the Interstate?
Glass, Eighth Street, alley behind Grand Hotel. Cut him off.
Good, now the other side.
What's wrong?
What... ?
How the hell do you feel yellow?
Hey, matches are a very big thing in our line of work.
Political.
No, we're terrorists, stay back or we'll blow.
Glass, what is it?
What do ay say?
Alright!
Alex Swan. My brother. The other two are called Taylor and Leveau.
There is a motel downtown, near the Machine Shop... the Suncrest. Room 138.
Then why tell me?
What is that?
No... No more killing.
Alex, please.
You were lucky today, vice boy. Captain said to leave it alone, but just remember, I'm watching you.
What about the ballistics report?
What the hell's going on?
Mike. No thanks, I'm fine.
Next week we work the park.
So what'll you do? After they give you the gold watch.
We're vice, I didn't see no pimps or hookers in that van. But if you're so gung-ho, we'd best call it in for some back-up.
Mike...
Reilly, Vice. I-
Make an appointment.
Device.
T.J., what're you doing?
It's our only option.
Reilly, what the hell are you-?
Yes.
Yes.
M'sieu Laval, M'sieu Filiba would like very much to see you.
on staircase; from Gaston's point of view. He stops.
Is this what you mean, M'sieu Laval?
And then what happened, M'sieu Filiba?
You've <u>never</u> been in Venice?
No!
Yes!
But--
Good morning, Major.
Nice day, Major.
You know, I'm not the marrying type. I like to take my fun and leave it.
Insignificant ... He's a secretary, always <u>was</u> a secretary, always <u>will</u> be.
And as for you, waiter--
M'sieu Laval, I have enjoyed the confidence of this family--
Two weeks and three days.
I am only insinuating that you are nervous.
Yes, m'sieu.
Monescu.
You see, the bag has just been found, and the reaction of relief from her former excitement and strain is just a little too much for her. It's not very serious, but just the same we'd better not take any chances.
Thank you, Major.
The tennis player?
Do you know the Marquis de la Tours?
Disappointed?
Thank you, Baron.
Darling!  Now tell me--tell me all about yourself. Who are you?
Darling, then let's be honest and return it to the lady.
The fourteenth of May.
Did you ever take a good look at her--uh--
Gaston. Let's open it--right now! Let's get away from here!  I don't like this place!
Five, seven, and nine--
No--not yet--but--  Two tickets to Berlin--first class and sleeper--night train ... Right ... Right ... Leave them in the name of--Don Ignacio Fernandez ... Right ... Thank you.
<u>Also</u>, <u>um</u> <u>zwoelf</u> <u>Uhr</u>.
Are you insane? You've to get out of here at once! She may come back any minute.
Goodbye--Madame Colet and Company!
Then you go to the left. There's a landing.
You like that statue?
Not in the least, madame. But you see, it's a very expensive bag--one has to be careful.
Well--how do you do, M'sieu Laval?
With your skin, I prefer crimson.
That's what you need!
Do you know my first name?
Oh?
No! Not enough!  In times like these, when everything is uncertain, every conservative person should have a substantial part of his fortune within arm's reach.
Madame.
Then lunch in the Bois--
Then a little nap--
Beautiful.
Like that!
And you're going to fall for them.
I'm crazy about you!
When a lady takes her jewels off in a gentleman's room, where does she put them?
Ah, let me have a little fun.
Thirty-three--
I wouldn't say anything--I would act.
No, m'sieu!
Madame, let me ask you: Who is M'sieu Laval, anyhow? Where does he come from? What is he?
You've had your breakfast--oh, but of course you have.
Two lumps, madame?
Yes, madame?
Water 14 feet above the keel in ten minutes... in the forepeak... in all three holds... and in boiler room six.
Please tell only who you must, I don't want to be responsible for a panic. And get to a boat quickly. Don't wait. You remember what I told you about the boats?
No! I'll do this with or without your help, sir. But without will take longer.
Shit.
She's not on the starboard side either.
The one on the other side is letting men in.
It's just the God damned English doing everything by the book.
An accident?!
Is that the going rate for saving the woman you love?
You know somebody?
How you two doin'?
The suction will pull us right down if we don't keep going.
Captain, the press knows the size of Titanic, let them marvel at her speed too. We must give them something new to print. And the maiden voyage of Titanic must make headlines!
The fall alone would kill you.
How cold?
Hello again.
Penguin? Oh, Cal! He is them.
So you feel like you're stuck on a train you can't get off 'cause you're marryin' this fella.
So don't marry him.
It is that simple.
Jack, these are quite good! Really, they are.
Oh no! Oh, I'm so sorry. Truly!
I think I would.  And teach me to spit too. Like a man. Why should only men be able to spit. It's unfair.
Jack, must you go?
May I cut in, miss?
You're not one of them. There's been a mistake.
Fabrizio said you might be up --
Where to, Miss?
Now it's worse.
No... don't say your good-byes, Rose. Don't you give up. Don't do it.
I don't think I've ever seen such a flat calm, in 24 years at sea.
It's make the bergs harder to see, with no breaking water at the base.
April 14, 1912.
Louis the Sixteenth wore a fabulous stone, called the Blue Diamond of the Crown, which disappeared in 1792, about the time Louis lost everything from the neck up. The theory goes that the crown diamond was chopped too... recut into a heart-like shape... and it became Le Coeur de la Mer. The Heart of the Ocean. Today it would be worth more than the Hope Diamond.
Rose, get in the boat!
Anya, I think you're crazy.
When I found out you were going I just had an attack of nerves--a few tears--and Herbert was on his way downtown to get my passport ... so who cares ... I'm here with you ... and that's all that matters to me.
Well--shall we go into dinner?
So that's your little dancer that you were playing around with in New York.  Oh--there's no accounting for tastes--  Mine, too, seem to be in the gutter.
I can think of nothing nicer. It's very kind of you to invite me--
Good afternoon--
I hope so.
Isn't she lovely?
No-o!
Where'd you get it?
What did you want a gun for?
Aces full.
How about a little game later?
I'm so sorry!
Like her paint job?
--You'll have all the boys tipping their hats to you--  --let me wipe it off.
Married?
I want you to get used to my voice--you're going to hear it a lot.
Thanks.
What are you thinking?
This time I'm really glad you showed up.
What, again?
You're a little ahead of yourself--the usual routine would be for you to propose, and if I accept, then you'd give me an engagement ring--
You can't lose me, Sally--I'm no lily myself!
If I was smart I wouldn't be working my way over on this ship.
We coulda got two third-class!
He's a colored man in chauffeur's uniform carrying a basket of fruit.
Quick, let me have that money. I'm broke and I'll need it for tips.
Yer lucky I'm here at all. I tell you, Jimmy--my feet'll never hold out.
Maybe she's in the show--One of the troupers--did you ever think of that?
Inspector McKinney.
They won't squawk--they're professionals.
Sorry to interrupt you, Mr Brett, but I have a message for you.
Your mother is feeling seasick and would like to see you right away.
Hello, Jimmy. What's up?
It's your deal.
How's your mother feeling?
Well, to tell you the truth, gentlemen, I've sworn off playing poker.
This is exciting--but if it's been stolen they can't get away with it on a ship--
It'll be very interesting to see how you go about solving this, Inspector--
If he lets you down I'll try my hand at sleuthing--  Bet I could find that bracelet--
I wouldn't worry about it--it'll turn up--  How about a nightcap, Inspector?
Thought you were going to turn in, Inspector.
You know what I'd do, if I were you--before the card game I'd go to the Purser's office.
Nice girl, that--  I'd hate to see <U>her</U> get a raw deal.  You know, the great trouble with crooks is they're <U>too</U> smart. Now if I'd taken that bracelet, I'd find some way to slip it back--I'd know I could never get ashore with it.
No--I'll take Sally and give you the best of it.
That's too bad.
Oh, Denby--have you seen Sally around?
"Will be back in four weeks"--  --that saves you eighty cents right there!
Just a minute--I don't think we need the word "Back" --Where <U>is</U> "Back"?
That's great! There's the address and message all in one word.
That's me!
Oh, was that me you put to bed? Thanks. I've been looking all over for you.
Hey, boy--give this man a cablegram blank.  Where is your wife?
Oh, there you are--
Here we are, folks--eighty thousand wild-eyed fans go mad--they go mad as Chad Denby--with the arms of iron, and the nerves of steel--picks up his racket--  What is this thing--a racket or a mallet?
Yes--but I didn't give it to him--
Looks like your old workshop back on 42nd Street.
You never fail at anything, do you, Chad?
You're just a Master of Ceremonies. He might have knocked his head off.
Yes.
Why--don't you like him?
I'll give you another chance to tell the truth, Lother.
I just tried to show her the difference between the squirrels and the skunks.
--And he has sex appeal.
H'mm ... no wonder I have trouble rounding up this show--Don't you know there's a rehearsal going on?-- And you wanted a raise.--Come on--get going or you'll get it!
Oh!--So that's it. Does she know he's on board?
Out my way in Montana we always call a bluff.
--you'd go with him!
Not because of Ned.
I'm crazy about the kid and I got him into it.  What do you want me to do?
I know he is. You change those clothes and then come to my cabin. I'll expect you around twelve o'clock.
That's the truth--every single word!
I mean--a lot of gentlemen would be offended if you searched them like that.
Yer crazy!--I ain't got no bracelet.
Oh, for Christ's sake!
Just pick up your money and go. Sick of listening to you simper.
Wyatt Earp...Dodge City, right?
Well I guess you can see, never a Dull moment.  Maybe you should Stay around to see what happens Next.  Who know?  You might find a Future here.
He said to turn loose of him.
Fair enough.  You know I got to Admit, you got a lot of bark on You comin' up here like this.
Oh, we ride for a brand all right.  This brand.  How 'bout you?
I'm sorry.  If there was any other-
Look at that!  Yeah!  Come and get Some, boy!
Forget it.
Not me.  I'm in my prime.
You don't even know him.
Not exactly...
Since when is faro a business?
I said poker's an honest trade. Only suckers buck the tiger.  The Odds are all with the house.
Very instructive
I don't know.  Probably ignore her.
Satisfied?
Nonsense, I have not yet begun to Defile myself.
Wyatt, my God!  You're shot to pieces!
Doc...
Well hell, Wyatt.  Wyatt, I want You to meet Father Feeney.  Father Feeney's just been initiating me Into the mysteries of the great And ancient Church of Rome.  You See, it appears my hypocrisy Knows no bounds.
I imagine it would, yes.  So now We can add self-pity to your list Of frailties.
You think I'm kidding.  You're the Most fallible, wrong-headed, self- Deluding, just generally Benighted jackass I've ever Known.  Yet, withal, even at your Worst, you're the only human Being in my entire life who ever Gave me hope.
First you can grab that black- Haired woman and make her your own.
A which?
Maybe you ought to have a talk With Doc, Wyatt.  I don't know if He's gonna make it.
See how she breezed out of here. Like she had wings.  Funny thing But I can't really remember how She looked.  I can remember parts Of her clear as crystal, her Mouth, her walk, how she shut her Eyes when she laughed, little Bits and pieces, but not the Whole package.  Can't put it Together for some reason.
There they go.  Look kinda like preachers.
You know, we might just pull this off.
We're the law, ain't we?  Well the Law don't ride around vermin-
Doesn't suit you.
Well he's handsome and he's Charming.  He's all right.  For Now.  Don't say it, I know, I'm Rotten.  I can't help it.  I've Tried to be good but it's too Boring.
You know you don't have to sneak. You could stay with me.  I know Things, Wyatt.  Sweet things.  I Could make you so happy.
I have to go.
Wyatt, I couldn't find a single Store that had laudanum any-
No, no, I don't want to keep you.
That the bottle Lou gave you? Better go easy on that stuff.
No, wait.  Please.  I know nothin' I say'll fix things but I want You to know it wasn't me.
Florentino!  He's getting away!
Well how do we look?
Wyatt, meet Fred White, he's town marshal.
Listen to me, both of you.  This Is no good.  This is trouble we Don't need.  For the first time in Our lives we got a chance to stop Wandering and finally be a Family.  Do this and you throw it All away.  You saw what happened To Fred White.
You were right.  It's nothin' like I thought.  I almost wish...
I am usin' it, Wyatt.  Been Wonderin' how the hell we got in This tangle.  You know they hit Clum's house, too?  Shot up his wife. His wife.  Who ever heard of That?  Men sneakin' around in the Dark, back-shootin', scarin' Women?  They're bugs, Wyatt.  You Know all your smart talk about Live and let live?  Ain't no live And let live with bugs.
I just got it fixed.
That a fact?
Got a sheaf of federal warrants. Being in the Territories it's up To our discretion how they're Served.  That means we got the Cowboys without quarter.  The Black flag, brother.  No Prisoners, no mercy, amen.
We should get moving.
Keep your eye on that brass ring. Don't let anything side-track you.
Maybe I jumped the gun.  Maybe Those Cowboys aren't near as bad As they're painted.  You know I Was thinkin', there's a lot of Money in the cattle business...
Virge, that's a misdemeanor.  You Go down there to arrest 'em, Something goes wrong, maybe this Time somebody gets his head Broke, suddenly it's a mess and It won't end there, you'll have Cowboys comin' around lookin' for Trouble from here to Christmas. You gonna risk all that over a Misdemeanor?
What about all these saloons?
See what I mean about it getting Spooky?
Ike Clanton, Old Man's eldest Son.  Know he ain't got the stuff, Makes him miserable.
... What were you saying, Admiral? Something about this 'not being a job for a wine-sniffing, skirt-chasing playboy spy?'
At least we know where the gold is. When are the recovery ships due?
Mr. Bond! Nice to see you.
You see, Mr. Bond, you and I are both men of action. But your era is passing. Words are the new weapons; satellites the new artillery. And make no mistake about it: In the right hands, they can be as deadly as your Walther PPK.
...And what's that, my dear?
- Instant melt-down.
Sometimes kill the crew; other times -  Torture them.
Actually, I've never known you to do either... But -
What - no lust for adventure?
Yes -
Stop it! You're hurting me! Can't you just be nice?
I'm so sorry, James. I promise, I'll never leave you again.
Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't it in our files?
There is one last thing, 007: Elliot Harmsway is vital to the economic interests of this nation. He's also a major contributor to the party. I expect him to be given every consideration.
Okay, Saunders. What is it this time? Rocket in the leg? Machine pistol in the arm?
Gone fishing.
... Shoelaces?
I don't know if you'd call it a boat...
I think I've just seen my next future ex-wife.
Where to now, Jimbo?
Interesting presentation.
... Kids?
Boyfriend?
Nice to run into you again.
I hope you'll be gentle.
And what do you call this?
Just remember: They think there's ten billion dollars in gold down there.
Blood or Dutch?
He's killed closer.
Down?
Sometimes you just have to -
... Yes?
And when might that be?
- Along with Tomorrow - the first world-wide newspaper. Circulation 27 million. Daily. -
The reason I invited the Minister here, 007, was to reassure him that this investigation will be handled with the utmost discretion.
Which is also why I've withheld this information from NATO and our allies.
You're to wear this mask at the Venice Carnival, and wait to be contacted.
And what do you call these? The Gang of Two?
I know my rights. These are international waters. The British Navy abandoned that boat, and I'm claiming it. Under international law, I have the right to salvage what's on that wreck.
The Canadian Prime Minister wants to set a lunch -
Your bankers want an answer about the Brazilian TV stations
The back-up does the same thing.
How is it now?
Bore through.  ...They used to say living well was the best revenge, Mr. Bond.  They're wrong.  Revenge is the best revenge.
I regret to inform you, sir, that Saddam Hussein is still demanding a bonus for his role in the Gulf War.
Who is that?!? What's in the box??
When are you going to find time to help me fix the roof?
You used that excuse to get out of the army.
You want me to mortgage my house to invest in a scheme of yours? You know the last time we went into something together Daddy had to go in his savings to keep us from ending on the street.
This is not a good time to take chances. Your best friend, Robert, an accountant, lost his home and is out on the street. We see him from time to time. He comes down to church for a free meal.
Why in the hell didn't you help mama?
I'm leaving and don't even call me when the shoe falls 'cause all he did for me was to try and run my life. I'm tired of people saying Babe Brother this, Babe Brother that. What's my name?
I told him we might not need it, if you can talk your parents into giving you your share of the property.
Linda, how come you don't see that Sunny puts his shoes on right?
I couldn't believe the things I was doing. It was like an internal struggle going on inside my body.
It was nip and tuck.
Doesn't he look a whole of lot better?
Harry is coming to pick me up.
What is that?
I don't want to wear out welcome, but you can stay in someone's heart longer than you can stay in their house. Come with us, boy. We are going to have a good time.
You know it is against the city ordinance to keep chickens or live stock.
Not anymore, not in the city.
My mind plays tricks on me. Is it okay if I take a bath now?
Let us settle this tomorrow.
You know, Babe Brother's wife just dumps greens in the pot without washing them.
I'm almost finished. I'm about to come to the punch line.
Man, act like this is your home.
It's the boy next door throwing at his birds. I'm just waiting on him to hit a pane in the window
Next time when I feel a little better perhaps.
How often is your wife called to help delivery?
You're suppose to teach your children what you know. Junior, I don't have to worry about. Babe Brother is a different story.
Haven't the years been good to Hattie?
Boy, I thought you were about to cross the river.
One can tell you are from back home. These people nowadays don't know what manners are.
Good afternoon, ladies.
Since she has repented, all she does is throw stones.
You invited me.
There is something that I always wanted to know. Tell me, how did those boys die?
None of your business.
I appreciate you lending me a hand. That lazy ass brother of mine was suppose to help me.
You don't act like the rest of Gideon's friends. They believe if you are not hard at work, you are hard at sin.
No, but I might have some Indian Chief Tonic.
I asked Harry about it. He didn't own up to it. He said he didn't know what got into Okra.
I can't accuse him just dry long 80.
We can't really bring another family in here with us.
How are you?
Can we leave this up 'til we move?
Andy!  I'm heading out the door.
Can I help pump the gas?
Woody!  Buzz!
Here!  In the car!
You'd think they've never seen a new toy before.
Say, isn't that mistletoe?
Listen, Lightsnack, you stay away from Andy.  He's mine, and no one is taking him away from me.
Don't talk to me about importance. Because of YOU the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy.
Wait a minute!  No Buzz!  This way! There's a special ship.  I just saw it!
What's gotten into you, Sheriff?  I was --
Get away!  Hoo-cha!  Hoo-cha!
Woody, stop it!!
Oh, I'm a sham!!
What?
No she's NOT --
Oh, really?  I'm from Playskool.
Laser-envy.
No!  No!  Don't leave!  Don't leave! You've gotta help us, please!  You don't know what it's like over here!
No wait!  You don't understand! Buzz is out there!  We've gotta help him!!
Were you scared?  Tell me honestly.
C'mon, guys!  Every Christmas and birthday we go through this.
Ha ha.  That's very funny, Buzz.  This is serious!!
Hi ya, fellas.  To infinity and beyond!
Uh, hey Sarge, have you seen Slinky?
Sargent.  Establish a recon post downstairs.  Code red.  You know what to do.
Come in, Mother Bird, this is Alpha Bravo.
There.
I'm red this time.
I can manage.
He's a pyjama case, really.
He made that. In his off hours.
That's your beach. This is the story. Leda walks by the shore, gathering shells.  Night comes on. She hears the beating of great wings and sees the approach of the swan. She runs away but it bears down and casts her to the ground. Curtain.
Finn, there's a splinter in your left foot.  If you don't let me take the splinter out, it will fester.
You're only a young thing.
I hope he doesn't pick on Jonathon.
Reprieve.
I'm Melanie.
I... I don't really know.
Good.  From now on I want you to expect that every word you utter will be tape-recorded, that the movement of your lips is being read. Got it?
I don't know, but under no circumstances would I talk about it here.  I want you to go home and relax the best you can.  Continue your life as if nothing has happened. That is very important.
Yes, I told you before, there are people who owe you money but they're not paying.  There's too much heat on Carl.
Even if I knew I wouldn't tell you. You do not want to come into contact with these people.  Only Carl knows who they are.  That's his real asset. Ruiz doesn't know them.  They don't know Ruiz.  Church and State.
Have you gone crazy?  You are not Carl.  You aren't as good as Carl.  They are moving the trial to a high security location.  The press has gone berserk.  The jury will be influenced.  Stay out of things. Let us try to win the case.
It's Saturday, Arnie.  You work too hard.
So Arnie, when were you going to tell me about the 3 million dollars we got in from San Francisco two days after I got arrested?
So my wife is lying?
So you know we put the case before the arbitration panel, none of whom had any expertise.  Superfund is just one of those words.  People stop paying attention.
I think she's lying.
No, I don't think so.  Leave me alone, give me money.  That's what I get from our daughter.  She has a way of shutting me out that seems very familiar.
Did you tell Dad?
Is this bad for him?
Where is it?  Where are the drugs?  Where are they?
Live with your parents?
Ach, that's what I'm talking about. Sarcasm.  Always fucking sarcasm. You're afraid and you think if you admit it people will think you're weak or won't like you --
Are you kidding...  I'm staying with you --
Yes, mom --
Did Courtney Love play Nancy in Syd and Nancy?
No more pissant basin league bullshit for us, hunh?
Move 'em to Texas, fry 'em up.
Are you getting this on tape?
Your friends at Warren, Putnam and Hudson.
I'll put this in the back.
All the professionals keep them in the trunk.
I don't know.  Eduardo Ruiz is the only real witness against Carl.  The security is very tight.  There may not be a way.
Yes, he threatened to kill my five year-old son.  I was under the impression I would be meeting Juan Obregon.
Why do you say that, Mr. Marquez?
We have the ability to change the color, odor, and physical property of cocaine.
What's he doing up here?
If you want her to stay out of it, then stop telling her everything. You should learn how to keep a secret.
Madrigal's alive.
Somewhere safe.
You should feel good about this.
What's your name?
One question.  How did you find about this?
The cocaine brand, 911, is an East Coast brand, a Juarez Cartel brand, and you must know it usually comes through into El Paso?
I don't know, maybe we missed her.
Hello.
Salazar's been taken down.  He was working for Porfirio Madrigal.
What?
I want the money, Mark, that's all.
Shut you mouth or you'll be next.
I'm no a fucking buftie and that's the end of it.
This was his nightmare. The dodgiest scam in a lifetime of dodgie scams being perpetrated with three of the most useless and unreliable fuck-ups in town. I knew what was going on in his mind: any trouble in London and he would dump us immediately, one way or another. He had to. If he got caught with a bagful of skag, on top of that armed robbery shit, he was going down for fifteen to twenty. Begbie was hard, but not so hard that he didn't shite it off twenty years in Saughton.
We'll be half-way down the road with the money.
Well, what's wrong, boy? Cat got your tongue.
What do you want?
You're too young.
And what age are you? Thirteen? Fourteen?
Actually it's a nightmare. I've been desperate for a shag, but watching him suffer was just too much fun. You should try it with Tommy.
I bet Lizzy told him where to put it.
Do you recall the school motto?
Are you getting out much?
Have you got any gear on you?
Now remember --
But try too hard --
That means fuck all. The sympathy vote.
Yeah, Beautifully fucking illustrated.
Do you see the beast? Have you got it in you sights?
And would sir care to settle his bill in advance?
Regret to inform, sir, that your credit limit was reached and breached a long time ago.
Sure.
If I'm giving up a whole day and the price of a ticket, I'm just saying it had better be good. There's plenty of other things I could be doing.
There.
It's the great outdoors.
We go for a walk.
Mr. Murphy, {leaving your friend aside,} do you see yourself as having any weaknesses?
Qual se tu?
Admit it. We're lost.
Sulu, what are you doing?
Following new course. Warp seven.
What's Emergency Landing Plan B?
This is Captain Pavel Chekov speaking. You are in violation of Neutral Zone Treaty. I advise you to release your hostages at once or suffer the consequences.
You are a master of understatement. They are likely to destroy the planet.
What's going on?
Your pain runs deep.
Where did you get this power?
Bird of Prey bearing one zero five mark two.
On the contrary. Gravity is foremost on my mind. Look, I'm trying to make an ascent here. Why don't you go pester Dr McCoy for a while?
Oh. I believe we are required to engage in a ritual known as the singalong.
But he does seem familiar?
At footspeed I estimate the journey to Paradise City at 1.2 hours.
Spock.
Be one with the horse.
What you have done is betray every man on this ship.
You stay out of this!  Why, Spock? Why? I.. All you had to do was pull the trigger.
I was not disposed to discuss... matters of a personal nature. For that, I'm sorry.
There's got to be a way out of this place.
How do you know?
I am here, Captain.
Spock... the booster rockets.
Spock?
Spock...  What have you done to my friends?
What makes you think I won't turn us around?
I know you'll whip her into shape, Scotty. You always do.
Oh my. Meanwhile, kids are putting eight million quarters a week in Space Paranoids machines and I'm not seeing one dime.
Want one?
Did you say Group 7 access?
What for?
Flynn!
Ever since he got that Master Control Program set up, system's got more bugs than a bait store.
Yeah...?
only yes and no...  You're a bit.
Way to go! We're haulin'!
This honey doesn't handle so good in town...
You said it.
I think we'd better shut off all access till we can find that file. Just to be safe.
Ed, I am so very disappointed in you.
That MCP, you know, that's half the problem right --
User requests are what computers are for.
Really. You'd have programs lined up around the block to use this place -- and no MCP looking over your shoulder.
Well, isn't it -- ?
What, just the three of us?
What's that?
Then...
What about our friend - Sark?
Not us, I hope.
The MCP blasted it... There are very few domains left with any power at all.
Flynn... you can't... I
Hey, Ram ... what were you ... you know, before?
He was disoriented in transport, Tron.
Hey, you know anybody who wants to get hold of some video games... cheap?
But-what if I can't...?
Yes...acknowledge, Master Control...
New guy...
I can't believe how bad it's gotten around here since the MCP started taking over... all the good functions have shut down... everybody looks so dead... I'm afraid to even go out during down-time...
You've grown, big program.
This is Flynn... the one who busted me out.
Nice...
Dinner's in the warmer.  Tell your father I may be late.
Switching to sub-vocal.  Gib, you copy?
What a team.  See you at eight.
See, kids now are ten years ahead				* of where we were at the same age. You probably think she's still a virgin--
Okay.  Okay.  De-nail ain't just a river in Egypt.  She's probably stealing the money to pay for an abortion.
What?  It's on the way.  She says she's got something for me.
Station wagon?
Ha!  The little prick ditched you!  That is so goddamn funny.
Just hang a minute.
Nobody believes it can happen to them.
She's still at my house.						*
We're dead, right?  So... where'd you put the transmitter?
I thought this look like your work.
So, it was your first time.
Call me, if you'd like to see some of my other pieces.
Do you like my tomb?  The museum				* financing fell out, so I thought				* your clients might be interested.
Especially in this light.  This is the only light they had then,				* so I like to study it this way. I love this place.  I love all ruins.
Yes.
Hello, Harry.
What did you tell him?
Not because you were attracted to him?
Tell me about your husband, Mrs Tasker.
Let me out of her!  Right now!
What?
What were you doing there?
Harry, what's the matter with you?  Tell them the truth.  We're married, we have a daughter--
I'm sorry, honey.
What did he give you?
Are we going to die?
No.  But I wanted to.
Tell me something before this stuff wears off and you start lying again.
... you should have seen your father, standing there all covered with spaghetti sauce.  He looked like such a dope.
Okay, just ask yourself.  What do women really want?  You take these bored housewives, married to the same guy for years.  Stuck in a rut.  They need some release.  The promise of adventure.  A hint of danger.  I create that for them.
Dickless.  If they took care of				* business, I'd be out of business, know what I mean?
But with you, she gets to be hot, right?
Who's your little friend?
Okay.  It's just, things are a bit hot for me right now.  If I get a signal...  I may have to leave suddenly.
Worse than Cairo?							*
To our assignment.
He said don't go nowhere. We'll be there some time tomorrow.
That was so good I am gonna have another.
I'm pretty hungry. When I went to the store I was gonna get some Ding-Dongs.
Tell him we gotta go.
Has he looked through it yet?
Bye-bye.
Where's your car? I'll walk you to it.
No. Not particularly.  How come?
I love to get pie after a movie.
Tell me about yourself.
Wow. What a swell place to work.
What's that?
So he really loved her?
A real live pimp?
Goddamn it, Alabama, you gotta get the fuck outta there! How much longer before he's slappin' you around? Punchin' you in the stomach? How the fuck did you get hooked up with a douche-bag like this in the first place?
Yes.
Did ya ever see "The Chinese Professionals"?
Top o' the morning, Mrs. Worley.
Write down Drexl's address.
I think what you did...
You did it, Quickdraw. I'm so proud of you. You were like a ninja. Did I do my part OK?
I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles.
I used to live by one back in Dearborn. It's real frustratin' to be surrounded by airplanes when you ain't got shit. I hated where I was, but I couldn't do anythin' about it. I didn't have enough money. It was tough enough just tryin' to pay my rent every month, an' here I was livin' next to an airport. Whenever I went outside, I saw fuckin' planes take off drownin' out my show. All day long I'm seein', hearin' people doin' what I wanted to do most, but couldn't.
I been in America all my life. I'm due for a change. I wanna see what TV in other countries is like. Besides, it's more dramatic. Where should we fly off to, my little turtledove?
What the fuck are you talkin' about?
Clarence, I gotta hand it to ya. You were cooler than cool.
I'm not lyin' to him. I mean it. I loved "Coming Home in a Body Bag".
Clarence sent a letter?
That's a pretty amazing story.
... formica. I did real well. I think she liked me.
But you're an actor. I hear these Hollywood guys have it delivered to the set.
Elliot what?
OK, call 'im up and arrange a meeting, so we can get through all the getting to know you stuff.
What the fuck did you bring that for.
He is, bar none, the greatest actor working in martial arts movies ever.
So you guys got five hundred thousand dollars worth of cola that you're unloading -
What do you think, eightball?
Get it straight, Lee isn't into taking risks. He deals with a couple of guys, and he's been dealing with them for years. They're reliable. They're dependable. And, they're safe.
Well, I guess it's about that time.
Apparently I'm not as dumb as you thought I am.
No. Not yet.
I don't know, Clarence, "Doctor Zhivago" is a pretty big movie.
Well, I have to admit, walkin' through the door and seein' these "Soldier of Fortune" poster boys made me a bit nervous. But, Lee, I'm fairly confident that you came here to do business, not to be a wise-guy. So, if you want, I'll put the gun on the table.
You like a little coffee with your cream and sugar?
Where'd you go?
If you don't know shit, why does he think you can sell it?
I can, but I don't.
I really don't know.
Yes, I still have friends on the force.
What makes you think I could do that?
You got it all worked out, don't you?
Apparently, Drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that.
If you don't hang around in this circle, no reason it should.
Come again?
That was very good.
Where'd he come from?
That Vietnam movie?
That was a good fuckin' movie.
Nicholson and I.
Suspect's words -
He's bluffin ya, Elliot. Can't you see that? You're an actor, remember, the show must go on.
You see what you get when you fuck wit me, white boy? You're gonna walk in my goddamn house, my house! Gonna come in here and tell me! Talkin' smack, in my house, in front of my employees. Shit! Your ass must be crazy.  I don't think that white boy's got good sense. Hey, Marty.  He must of thought it was white boy day. It ain't white boy day, is it?
Preach on, Big D.
They won't search you. I promise. You haven't done anything.
You're the one who wanted to drive fast.
Yes.
No.
Then where the hell do you get off talkin' that kind of talk?
Wake up, Cole.
To be determined by the proper authorities.
That's him.
Wow, a guy in a Chevy is chasing her and some other guy I can't see.
Let's consider again our current information -- if the symptoms were first detected in Philadelphia on June 28, 1995, that makes us know that...?
Mr. Cole?  My name is Doctor Railly. I'm a psychiatrist.  I work for the County -- I don't work for the police. My only concern is your well being -- do you understand that?
Have you been a patient at County? Have I seen you someplace?
Do you know why you're here, James.
You don't have a driver's license, James?  Or a Social Security card?
Why not?  Most people have some ID.
What's wonderful about the air, James?
You're afraid of germs?
July.
Cole!  James Cole!  You escaped from a locked room six years ago.
I can't believe this is a coincidence, Mr. Cole.  Have you been...following me?
My father told me that.  "Never cry wolf."  Then people won't believe you if...something really happens.
About an airport...before everything happened.  It's the same dream I always have -- the only one.  I'm a little kid in it.
You were very upset.  You're always very upset in the dream, but I never knew it was you before.
Mason???
I need help all right.  They're coming after me.
James!  That's a policeman.  Pretend you don't know me.  If he sees you...
I want to be here.  In this time.  With you.  I want to become...become a whole person.  I want this to be the present. I want the future to be unknown.
You... you couldn't have heard me.
You were in my dream just now.  I didn't recognize you.
That's what they were up to!  Freeing animals!
They may be looking for us, James.  Use this.  You can fix it in the Men's Room.
James, if we're identified, they're going to send us someplace...but not to Key West!
Who would you call, Mr. Cole, who would straighten everything out?
So you could talk to these scientists and they do what?  Send you to the future?
What're you writing?  You a reporter?
What...???
We need to talk.  Come on.  Upstairs.  I am a new person!  I'm completely adjusted.  Witness the tux.  It's Armani.  Who chattered?  Goines?  Weller?
Me?  Are you kiddin?  You're the one! You were a hero, man.  They gave you a pardon!  And whadda you do?  You come back and fuck with your teeth!  Wow!
This part isn't about the virus, is it?
It's about obeying, about doing what you're told.
I asked you, why did you volunteer?
Kathryn, you know he can't possibly know that.  You're a rational person. You're a trained psychiatrist.  You know the difference between what's real and what's not.
WHY DON'T WE FORGET MY GODDAMN PSYCHIATRIST AND DEAL WITH THE TASK AT HAND.  THIS IS IMPORTANT.
Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
Don't forget to open it for me.  I can't be opening my own bottle.
Oh, Jesus.
Ain't you got a little something for the infirm?
The day wasn't so bad.  We all got through it all right.
You afraid of the dark?
We're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
It's a Movado.
Hundred and eight ain't a hundred and thirteen.
Where in Mexico would you like--
Twenty-seven, fifty.  That's all I got.
Nope.  Darrell.
You own this place?
It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.
Somewhere else?  Mister somewhere else is fifty miles from here.  How you planning on getting it there? You gonna push this heap yourself?
Then you're only a hundred-forty- five in the hole.  Now why don't you just take your Visa Express Silver Card, call Karl Malden and have him send you the money lickity split.
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
Take it.  As soon as I get my money. Fifty dollars for an almost new gasket.  You don't know what kind of a deal you're getting.
We're closed.  Come back in the morning.
I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.
What would a truck stop be without beer?
Shasta!  Now why'd you go and scare the nice man like that?  Sorry about that, hon.  Enjoy your beer, and try to have a nice day.
Ned!  Now look at what you done! Are you all right?
Is that the way you want it, boy?  A bullet in the head in the middle of the desert?  Ends like this and you won't be able to spend a dime of that blood money.
For the love of God would you two give it a rest?  Lord almighty.  In all my years I have never seen anything so pathetic.  How far did you think you were going to get with this?  Neither one of you can wait to slit the others throat.  Now use what little smarts you got.  If I was going to bust you I wouldn't have waited until after you killed Jake.
. . .at the very least.  I know there was more than thirty-thousand dollars.  Now, how much did you get?
There you go, Mrs. McKenna.  Just put it in there.
Who was that on the phone?
I put up new drapes, Jake.
They look nice.
Maybe I don't want you to.
It's very nice of you to help me. That package is kind of heavy, and it's so hot.
Least you can leave.
You've been around.
Nice place you got here.
There.  All done.  Lift me down.
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
Damn it, Grace!  Tell him.
Did you ever?
Have you ever been there before?
Please.  I won't hang on you.  As soon as we get there you can dump me.  I don't care.  I just want to get out of here.
I know where we could get the money. A lot more than one-hundred-fifty dollars.
He's got money.  In a floor safe in the living room.  I've never seen it, but he talks about it all the time.  More like brags.  He loves his money.  Wouldn't think of spending some of it on me.
Yeah, a bird in a gilded cage.
It's not a combination lock.  It takes a key.  He keeps it on him all the time.  I mean all the time.  It scratches up against me when we do it.
Shit!
I came back for you; this morning I came back.  Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.
Where's the safe?
You don't know?  Jesus Christ! Don't you think you should have found out before we killed him?
It's got to be here.  I heard him talk about it.  He bragged about it. Six steps out, three left.
One-hundred-thousand dollars.  A little more.
That's all talk.  He's got nothing on us.  He let you kill Jake.
He can't prove anything, John.  He can't turn us in.
I know.  He was to take the fucking money.
Why?  So when the cops catch up with us you can try and sell me out again?  You take your hald of the money and run.  You might want to try Mexico.  With all that dough you'll live like a queen.
I can't make it.  Grace?  Grace!?
John!  Can you hear me?  Are you still there?
Someone will find me.
You idiot!  You'll kill us both!
I swear to you that's all that happened.  I haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.
I have half a mind to--
I guess we've never been introduced proper.  Jake McKenna.
What brings you to Sierra?
Hey!
Why would I kill her?
Hungry?
Just to get out of here?  That doesn't seem much for a murder.
That's a bit much.
Don't say that.  I had a marriage of convenience with Grace, and look where that's lead.  Well, looks like we got ourselves a pact.
What should I do?
You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know.
I went to your place.  We talked, just like you told me.  We drove out into the desert . . .
No.
It's not like that.
Wait a minute.  Just listen to me--
That's not the reason I'm here.  I swear it.
I came for Grace.
This morning when I came in on you and Grace, you swore you hadn't so much as been near the bedroom.  Now you make straight for it.
Is that what happened?  Did you even make it out to the desert, or did you just ply the afternoon between my sheets?
A drifter, a loner, a trouble maker like you?  Just passing through town, need money so he busts in on an, old man.  Only this old man's got himself an automatic, and he knows how to use it.  A man's got to protect his home.  His wife.  You're dead, boy, and your own mother wouldn't convict me.
Not from where I stand.
You'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life.
For defending my honor this afternoon.
I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
They're not very imaginative?
Fine.  I was making time with your girl.  Now I'm all scared, and I'll never make that mistake again.  Now go away.
Mister!
Oh, that tears it, Mister.  I'm gonna bust you up but good.  I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then . . . and then bust those pieces up, and then . . . and then spread them all around.  That's what I'm gonna do.  You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister.  I'm crazy.  I'm psycho crazy.
Fucking kid.  And look at you; breaking fucking pencils.  You're a Neanderthal.
He is at that.  No so much a fault of his own.  Poor boy had quite a trauma as a child.
There was a young man over at Jamilla's today when it got hit. Way she tells it he got whacked around by one of the robbers.
That's too bad.  I was hoping you were there.  Maybe you could help us catch the guy who got away.  Or maybe you could explain about all that money that got tore up when Jamilla shot that biker.
Nice night for a drive.  Morning really.  I guess that's about the only way to keep cool; riding around with the top down on a fancy convertible in the first hours of the day.
Just step from the car.  Nice and slow.
Now step around to the back of the car and open the trunk for me.
What'd you think, boy?  That you were the first man to drift through this town she came on to?  Not by a long shot.  You're just the most gullible.  How much did you get?
Soda.  You got any soda?
I call the policia.
Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
Hell no!
...But ain't you got a little something for the infirm?
Nothing makes the Great Spirit laugh harder than a man's plans. We all got plans. I planned on seeing all my life. I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
Time's up. Any last words of wisdom?
Then maybe you should've. Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.
California...
I hope so.  Listen, McKenna about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
"You can't shoot 'em!" I like that.  I bet she led you on good, didn't she?  Taking you up to the house to hang drapes. Oh that's a good one. Bet she had you hard as a rock wiggling her ass in your face.  I bet you just wanted to pull down her pants and hog her out. Then me busting in like some wild bear. Ha! Bet you had a fire going under you.
I've done a few things but I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
Come to think of it, how 'bout some money upfront?
No, but it don't matter anyway when you're lying there with your brains all over my carpet and I'm telling Sheriff Potter about this drifter, didn't have enough money to fix his car. And Darrell happened to find his gun, and through maybe this drifter heard old Jake got some money stashed away, and figgered he might try to break in and steal it!
That's a thick change of heart from this afternoon.
Two-hundred dollars?
Hey, Mister.  You gotta quarter for the juke?
Got any requests?
You're not from around here, are you? Where you from?
Hey mister. Mister, I just... I just wanted to thank you.
Harlin around?
You want to take a look at my car?  I think the radiator hose is--
Look, Harlin, I've got places to be.
How much time?
Twenty-after-ten.
Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
I don't know, but "it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through."  Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.
Then you ain't gonna have the car.
Hey there.  I was beginnin' to think you wasn't comin' back...  You don't look so good.
No charge.
Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
Soda.  You got any soda?
Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.
No, I've got it.
It's very nice of you to help me.  That package is kind of heavy, and it's so hot.
Drove into Superior?  What for?
You're lucky you didn't break down in the desert.  Day like today, you'd be dead in no time. When you leaving?
What happens when you lose?
I like them.  I was sick of looking at this room.  I think they add a little life.
You never did answer my question.
Yeah, well I said I was an idiot. Whatta you say we get out of here, take a drive somewhere, talk...
You love him?
Did you ever?
It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't. I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
You'd never understand.
It's just such a mess. With Jake I mean...
Yeah. What do you want. Life, right?  Have you ever been to California?
Oh yeah. It's far, it's another world.
What do you mean?
I can't kill, Grace. I can't kill anybody.
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
Grace ... Grace?
I can't see it.
I don't know about that?
Why?
Why? So when the cops catch up with us you can sell me out again?
Hope is a four-letter word.
<u>Jake</u>...
...And let me guess.  This robber -- he gets your money.
A hundred-forty-five would probably cover it.
What'd you say to me!
One way, or round trip?
Twenty-seven, fifty.  That's all I got.
You got a beer?
My lord, that little baby of yours Virgil, has gotten cuter'n a bunny's nose.
Well, he offered, and I just couldn't refuse. His car overheated.
Goddamnit Virgil, stop!  Don't!
Who was that on the phone?
I put up new drapes, Jake.
You been a bad girl, Grace. You took my heart from your Mama, didn't ya? You betrayed her! Like you did me. There ain't no forgivin' ya, girl!
I want to stay.
Toby!  Toby Tucker, leave him alone!
What's that?  ..."concealed" is a definite no no in this town, Ivan. You know anything about Jamilla's grocery store?
Is that the entire message?
How old is Jeb?
I don't think I got the job in New York.
Is Jeremy okay?
I don't know. It's been a while.
Not a specific day. What's this about?
Megan?
Yeah? Megan where are you calling from?
Would you like to try going--
Oh. Elijah Price came to visit me at the center today.
You've never been sick?
What's this about? This is obviously some scam. Is this where you tell me one of those pictures is like an investment?
Why is it, do you think, that of all the professions in the world... you chose protection?
I got you a seat in the seven hundred level.  It's nose-bleed territory, but at least you won't get spit on.
The guy might not have been carrying anything.
I have to go now.
I am. I'm helping him with the sale.
Dunne, it's Jenkins, we got a guy at gate 17C with a bogus ticket. Says he knows you. He won't tell me his name.
You put too much. That's two hundred and fifty pounds.
I know now.
That was me they were talking about. I almost died. That was me.
How are you feeling?
How so?
For a second there I thought you were a fanatic.
...I got a present for you.
Well, go get it then.
If they was just here for the fuckin', how come they lit out the back window?
You told them cowboys you had it.
Now this Strawberry Alice person, tell me again.
Billiards, eh? Even though I don't really wish to play?
He tell you where them others is?
I didn't mean no offense.  I guess you're the one them cowboys cut up.  Ned an' The Kid, my partners, are they... ?
Oh. Yeah.
I didn't mean... with me. Alice and Silky, they'll give you one... if you want.
Yeah, I guess.
Not really...  Maybe a couple of Peacemakers...  I imagine you could overlook those, eh, Bill? If you didn't see them... or hear them?
Charley, see what kind of "books" Mister Beauchamp is packing... but watch you don't get wet.
Uh... a little, maybe.
Shit, Skinny, we got railroad barons an' cattle barons, but you' re gonna be the first of the billiard barons.
Word must have got all the way to Texas by now.
They really got all that money, them whores?
I guess you just carry it for snakes an' such.
He should have armed himself if he was gonna decorate his saloon with the body of my friend.
The... Duck of Death.
Uh... I can assure you, Mister Daggett... the events described within are based... on the accounts of eye witnesses and...
Duke.
First off... Corky didn't carry two pistols, though he should of.
Well, that bullet whizzin' by panicked Corky, an' he done the wrong thing! Pulled his gun in such a damn hurry he shot off his own toe. Meantime, Bob aims good and squeezes off another... but he's so drunk he misses again an' hits the thousand dollar mirror behind the bar. Well, now the Duck of Death is good as dead 'cause this time Corky does right an' aims real good, no hurry...
But... if he doesn't miss?
What?
They... they killed him. I... thought you know that. I thought you knew because...
What'd Ned say?
He said how you was really Three Fingered Jack out of Missouri... an' Bill said "Same Three Fingered Jack that dynamited the Rock Island and Pacific in '69 killin' women and children an' all?" An' Ned says you done a lot worse than that, said you was more cold blooded than William Bonney or Clay Alisson or the James Brothers an' how if he hurt Ned again you was gonna come an' kill him like you killed a U.S. Marshall in '73.
William Munny, yeah.
You shot Charlie Pepper, didn't you? And you're the one killed William Harbey an' robbed the train over...
Maybe I ain't.
What for?
Jesus!
She's passed on, Kid.
Well, we was. Like you said, I changed my mind an'...
Say, Bill. That business in Jackson County... did that really happen? I mean how they say it happened?
He ain't killed.
It's gonna get riper yet.
He's in there.
Yeah, I guess so.
That was... the first one.
It's a hell of a thing, ain't it, killin' a man. You take everythin' he's got... an' everythin' he's ever gonna have...
We ain't bad men no more, Bill. Hell, we're farmers.
Easy, huh? Hell, I don't know that it was all that easy then... an' we was young an' full of beans.  Bill... if you was mad at 'em... if they done you wrong... I could see shootin' 'em...
Well, we thought we was doin' it for money...  What'd they do anyhow? Cheat at cards, steal some strays, spit on a rich fella?
She gave me the evil eye.
Nobody liked me... none of the boys. They was scared of me... figured I might shoot 'em out of pure meanness.
Quincy, he was always watchin' me. Scared.
Say, Bill... You ever... ever go into town... an' all?
Some fucker's shootin' at us.
He hit you?
You suppose maybe we're in somebody's field?
Shit.
I give it up 'cause I hate sleepin' out in the air... fuckin' sticks in my food... an' fuckin' bugs in my food... an' fuckin' rocks under my back...  Shit, I sure do miss my fuckin' bed.
I brung this for when we had to kill them fellows.  I guess we could use some now.
I seen him.
Easy, Bill.
That fella come by... Tom.
N-nobody... only you took your shotgun an' that pistol an'...
What was you shootin' at us for, anyhow?
Clouds, Kid. We was lookin' at them clouds on account of we got a storm ridin' up our ass.
You was right to change your mind, Kid.
Jesus.  You done this before?
Well, I guess I woulda at least pulled my pistol an...
We're gonna need more food... at least three days worth...
I don't kill nobody without him.
Well, suppose he does?
That ain't what I mean.
I told you I'm a damn killer. I done it before.  I'm more killer than him.
Yeah.
There was ninety-one million -
Not dope. Something else. Some what?.. He doesn't knob what they were buying. But not dope... people.
&lt;&lt;It is longer than that. And not so dark. &gt;&gt;
I'11 have this thing in front of a grand jury by Monday.
They just said they wanted time.
Give me some credit. I got you this far, let's go to the grand jury. This is never going to stop if we -
I love you.
I know who he is.
Fuck you. I'11 never shit right again. So who did it? Own up.
I know you. You don't think I know you're on the take. This whole fucking precinct is dirty. You don't have a fucking leg to stand on.
What are we gonna do?
How do you do?
I did you a favor by standing up for you last night, but don't think we're friends. I'm sorry, but I have other things -
What about Redfoot?
The answer is no.
Ahh, Mr. Hockney. Do join us.
I am sorry, Mr. McManus.  f implore you to believe me, Mr. Keaton. Mr. Soze is very real and very                             + determined.
What did you say?
No matter. Kill away, Mr. McManus.
I hear you did time with old Spook. Yeah, he was a good egg. I used to run a lot of dope for him. Fuckin' shame he got shivved.
Some Limey. He's a middle-man for somebody. He doesn't say and I don't ask.
No matter. He'll have to know how close we came.
That's crazy, Dave and it doesn't matter. He has total immunity and his story checks out. He doesn't know what you want to know.
I know you liked Keaton I know you think he was a good man.
You know a dealer named Ruby Deemer, Verbal?
I'11 get right to the point. I'm smarter than you. I'11 find out what I want to know and I'11 get it from you whether you like it or not.
You keep trying to lay this whole ride on                 t Keaton. It wasn't like that. Sure he knew, but Edie had him all turned around.                 r I'm telling you straight, I swear.                        +
He wasn't behind anything. It was the lawyer.
Do you believe in him, Verbal?
I came clean. I told it like it happened on the boat. So what if I left out how I got there? It's got so many holes in it, the D.A. would've told me to blow amnesty out my ass. So you got what you wanted out of me. Big fucking deal.
Don't shine me, Verbal. No more stalling. You know what I'm getting at.
I don't understand what you're saying. I saw Keaton get shot, I swear to you.
Verbal, he left you behind for a reason. If you all knew Soze could find you anywhere, why was he ready to send you off with the money when he could have used you to take the boat?
Edie...
This is all bullshit.
I knew him. He would never -
Is he Keyser Soze I don't know, Verbal. It seems to me that Keyser Sate is a shield. Like you said, a spook story, but I know Keaton - and someone out there is pulling strings for you. Stay here and let us protect you.
Where are you going to go, Verbal? You gonna run? Turn states evidence. You might never see trial. If somebody wants to get you, you know They'll get you out there.
My client offers his full cooperation in these proceedings. In exchange, his testimony is to be sealed and all matters incriminating to himself are to be rendered inadmissible.
Counselor, I will prosecute your client.
What did he find?
No -- we don't want this case in court.
It's a generous offer, Mr. Galvin... ...nothing can make the woman well...but we try to compensate...to make a gesture...
Yes.
That was our insurance company's recommendation.
What are you doing here?
You know what that would mean?  To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby.  Were you not?
And what did your team do...
Objection, we've...
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
Engaged to render an opinion.  For a price.  Is that correct?  You're being paid to be here today?
Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor.  Certified in Internal Medicine?
Orthopedics?
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
Mr. Concannon...?
Objection!  This is ri...expect us to accept a photocopy, we have the original right...
You would not...?
In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that.  Isn't that right?
Just now...
Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago.  Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie.  When were you lying?
And why, please tell us, would you think that?
Please sit down.  I told your wife. I'm sorry that we have to meet out here.  I've got a case coming in two days in the  Superior Court and my office is a mess of papers.
I swear to you I wouldn't have turned the offer down unless I thought that I could win the case...
I'm going to win this case...Mist...Mr. Doneghy...I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars.
I am seventy-four years old.
I am on the staff of...
Are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice?
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I...
Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes.  In your opinion is his estimate correct?
You know...sometimes people can surprise you.  Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth.
If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anaesthetic...the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
The most respected ...
He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth.  He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life.  And we can prove that.  What we don't know is why.  What went on in there?  In the O.R.  That's what we'd like to know.  Something went wrong.  And you know what it was.  They gave her the wrong anesthetic.  What happened?  The phone rang...someone got distracted...what?
I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no  question of that.  It's just a matter of how big...
I do.  Who is it?  The Doctors. What do you owe them?
Continental Casualty...
This is Miss Costello...?
We find that your subscription lapsed...
They might.  Yes.  That's the point ...is that they might...you see, the jury wants to believe.  They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe.  I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case.   I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve.  And every one of them it's written on their face, `This is a sham.  There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe...maybe...'
I've got to work...
That's not the question.  It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault?  If I'd...if I'd...I never should have taken it.  There was no way that I was going to win.
And it's over...?
You want me to tell you it's your fault?  It probably is.  What are you going to do about it?   I thought it's not over till the jury comes in.
Joe...  Joe...
You're pressuring yourself...
Dr. Gruber.
I had an appointment at his office, I think I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting...
I...please.  My wife...my wife's prescription has run out.  If I can call him...
No, no, no.  I have to talk to him.  If I can only call him..
I have to talk to you.
To do what...?  To do what, for chrissake...?   To help her to do what?  She's dead...
We've got her sister.  Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point.
I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anaesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
They had an obstetrical nurse in there.  We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
'Mary Rooney, forty-nine.  Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.'  Can you get out tomorrow?  How come she isn't speaking up.
Okay now.  Cases:  Smith versus State of Michigan.
So what?
What I'm saying, they're getting some help.
Yeah?  How's our new witness?
Who?  They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.
...four years ago...
We got a mistrial, you know.  Joe -- did you hear what I said...?
Yes.  Yes, I have.
He saw her at the Northern Care...
Are we going to win?    We have, you know, other tactics, though...
I spoke to her, and everything is all right.
I've been meaning to come in a long time.
Mrs. Simmonds.
One hour.
Well, well, well.  Huh?
...they start again three minutes earlier...
Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is?
...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.   Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.
That Frank was working on.  Yeah. He thought Franky needed some help, so they bribed a juror.  So Franky finds out.  He comes to me in tears. He thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker' is got to be a saint.  I told him ' Franky, wake up.  These people are sharks. What do you think they got so rich from?  Doing good?'  He can't be comforted.  He tells the boys at Stearns and Harrington they've disappointed him, he's going to the Judge to rat them out.
I can give you one thing: he was in love with her.
And you like it.
Shouldn't you be sitting down?
Would you like a drink now?
Not what you think. We're very happily married.
Scottie, do you believe that someone out of the past, someone dead, can enter and take possession of a living being?
Yes.
I didn't know where she was going to lead you.
Great-grandmother. The child who was taken from her whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to her death - was Madeleine's grandmother.
Nothing.
How do you know all these things she doesn't know?
No, she's all right. She's still here. But I'll get her home soon.
Hello?
No, there are just a few things I want to ask you, and --
About three years.
Oh, Well, thank very much. But no thanks.
As friends? We'd just see a lot of each other as friends, and you'd "take care of me"?
No, Judy, I'm not going to move! Please! Stay in the chair!
Ah, no!!! I don't want to be dressed like someone dead!
Ernie's?
Scottie, why are we here?
But why? Why here?
You look like Madeleine, now. Go up the stairs.
Scottie, please...!
And you were such an apt pupil! What fun you two must have had, playing games with me! Why me? Why did he pick on me?!!
Ah, yes! I was a set-up. I was the made-to-order witness. Where is he now?
Do you remember where you were?
When?
Oh... wandering about.
Wandering about.
You shouldn't have brought me here, you know.
You could have looked in my car. Oh, but you didn't know my car, did you?
One shouldn't live alone.
Don't you think it's sort of a waste for the two of us to...
How can you be sure?
How old?
What are you thinking?
Where?
What do you remember?
Where?
If I could find the key... find the beginning put it together...
I'm not mad. I'm not mad. And I don't want to die, but there's someone inside me, there's a somebody else, and she says I must die... Scottie, don't let me go!
You've been there before. You've seen it.
Madeleine, a hundred miles south of San Francisco there's an old Spanish Mission, Mission San Juan Bautista. It's been preserved exactly as it was a hundred years ago as a museum. Now, think hard, darling. You've been there before. You've seen it!
Here with you.
Let me go! Let me go!!
It's this darned corset. It binds. He retrieves the stick.
Well, you know those police department doctors: no sense of style.  Ah, tomorrow!
How do you know? Personal experience?
What do you mean?
I know. Everybody tells me.
Well?
Aren't you ever going to get married?
My... the acrophobia.
Step number two.
Easy, now.
Is she pretty?
Mm. Better.
What was this desperate urge to see me?
It was hers. It was built for her. Many years ago.
By her own hand.  There are many such stories.
Jesus.
They'll get us on accesory to murder.
I'm not going to ruin my life over a dead whore.
How ya doing?
No, because your opinions are idiotic and have nothing to do with what any given conversation is about, which makes 85% of your eagerly injected thought process highly offensive to me.
You're an asshole Adam.
The floor was wet. She slipped!
Four hours and fifteen minutes. I can make Vegas in 3 and change.
What are you doing?
Stop it! Listen to me. Let's just take a second here and take hold of the situation, OK? Let's just review our options here.
Bury her out in the desert.
You don't just casually walk out of a Vegas Casino with a dead woman.
Wrap her up in blankets. Bring the car around to the back of the hotel, throw her off the balcony, put her in the car...Done.
We check out the area and wait for a time when it's clear.
Someone goes to Walmart, gets some buckets, brushes, mops, Spic and Span, the works.
Wait. Wait a minute.
She's Asian. They don't have Jews in Asia.
Now I am the last to say that we have done here is a good thing. It's not. It's not a good thing. But it was, given the circumstances, the smart play. We did what had to be done. And...well...I'm proud of us. I'm proud of each and every one of us. We performed. Under the most complex and nerve shattering of situations, we stood fast and we delivered. I feel proud.
Don't talk to me about character.
You got some mighty fucking fine bad timing Adam. We got a rehearsal situation here.
I'm talking about DNA samples, fiber optics, search parties, they got infrared scanners, FBI scientists. They figure this shit out. They always figure it out.
Don't snap at them!
They're screaming for Starbursts.
Real times.
The bucks gonna stop right here.  If my son doesn't know the six New England states, if he has trouble with geography, I won't stick it in his face. I'll help the little guy. I'll put him in the car and take him out there. I'll take him to Maine for a big Lobster dinner, go skiing in Vermont, hot dogs at Yankee Stadium...I won't stare him down.
I want you to hear me out.
I got a migraine like a little monkey kicking in the side of my skull, Mike Tyson with a fucking sledge hammer trying to crack...
So. When is the wedding.
What are you talking about?
What?
She's not here.
No I don't.
Where do you look? What side of the neck?
I got her arm.
What's your fucking point?
What's goosed?
OK. Definitely not cool! Definitely inappropriate behavior here.
What?
I said, what have we done?
I don't know! I just want to get married.
After you drop the kids off, take Micheal home. Put a few drinks in him so he'll sleep.
That it was all an accident. She wants to hear it from Micheal's mouth.
This is a situation that defies judgement. We have acted and showed courage that is not of a kind known by most.
I don't hate women.
False.
I say to myself, look at the map. Look what's all around you. People who wish bad bad things for you and your people. For thousands of years the Jews are fighting everybody. It used to be they'd throw rocks, then the iron revolution and they would attack with spears. Then the gunpowder revolution. Now they're shooting fire power back and forth, all day bullets flying, babies getting shot.
Take Mexico.
The Mexicans would love it. They're dying for a little order down there. They need direction.
Hotel for my parents, the tent, the band, the Judge...
You can't play around with these tent people.
Don't you dare.
Why do you feel the need to explore this side of your personality?
I'm talking about the kind of people you hang out with...about growing up, assuming responsibility of yourself.
He just doesn't talk a lot.
Do you love me?
How much?
Seating problems.
Keith do not trivialize this.
We're supposed to have gold-trimmed padded seats, now they're telling me that there was a mistake and we can't have padded.
Go down to the seat place and straighten this out.
I need your help.
Take care of those chairs.
Will you please call the chair people?
Hi.  Are you calling from jail?
Well, the night is young. Did you straighten out the chair situation?
Yeah. Nesting.
What okay?
The chairs.
Yeah. Sure.
I know.
That means we get five hundred thousand to help raise the kids.
You fucked a prostitute?
You left a dead prostitute out in the desert? Alone?
I told Boyd two fucking minutes!
Like if something happened to him, he could still get us.
I don't know. He could have told someone. He could have, like in the event of his death, somehow let someone know where those bodies are buried.
I could have done it better. I'm a fucking ball-buster I am.
Dear God...I don't know how to pray.
Do you hear buzzing Fish?
Yeah. I got some kind of buzzing. Like a zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz thing just chipping away in the back of my skull.
Yeah, well, it's a nasty problem.
I appreciate it. I do, but...Maybe you ought to just ease up om yourself a bit.
That ought to be about the end of that.
No...No.
You alright?
Pup corn?
There.
That's a good one.
I think you'd make an excellent Big Brother.
We don't think so. I mean, we just want the singing when I come out.
I love it. I just love, love, love, love it.
Good times.
Shut up Micheal.
I'll come to you tonight.
Keep quiet. These miserable brats only get in the way.
Didn't you say you know how to make vanilla pudding?
No, miss. Smoking makes him spit and feel ill.
Take me there.
How long are you staying?
His mother wanted to keep him. She came from a poor family. I was in love with your aunt. I would like to have acknowledged him but I was afraid of losing her. That's why I didn't say anything.
If you only knew ... When I was young I was full of idealism. I wanted to do something on a big scale for others, something to show my great love for humanity. But as soon as I tried to do something about it, I became afraid that I would be laughed at and I felt like a fool ... and so I went back into my shell.
Why don't you ask her to stay on for a few days?
Sit down, woman, sit down.  You like me, don't you?
Yes, yes, but there's no need to bring that up. How far are you prepared to help me?
You believe me, don't you?
Don't lie. You don't believe me either.
That's fifteen by seven?
It's for wheat. We've always grown maize in the strip above the vegetables.
My God, what have you done to him!
She's mad.
Shouldn't I be? You, on the other hand ...
And this chest?
I don't know -- they've always been there.
Jorge, Don Jaime's son, at your service.
Is that all you're going to devote your life to?
Are they going to work here too?
Yes. Why?
It's for people!
He's good at rabbiting and he knows it. When we're in the country, if he doesn't hunt he doesn't get fed.
There's been an accident.
In you go! Moncho, lead the way!  You stay here.
You have decided to leave, Moncho.
I have no desire to see the world again, but if you order me to...
She has the face of an angel. What a pity you can't see her.
What about you, Manuel?
Welcome, miss. I'm Ramona, Don Jaime's servant.
Have I slept long?
I'm going to the hen house. Are you coming with me?
) Daryl Lindenmeyer was only here briefly, one semester at most. But he was singularly the most brilliant student I ever had in a classroom. He created programs so beautiful, so lyrical, they were almost like symphonies...
In English, please.
You were supposed to act as if everything was real.
But with the six months off I get for being your guinea pig, I've only got to survive another 17 years, 5 months, and 23 days.
You're wasting your time. I'm not going to play any more of your goddam games.
She saved your life, Parker. She didn't have to, but she did.
None. He could be hiding, he could be helping Sid, or could be in little pieces on Santa Monica beach.  Any idea what Sid's going to do next?
There is no way Parker killed those guards. No way.
Give me 30 seconds, then flip every switch you can reach.
Ms. Deane, you wanted to see me?
What's the assignment?
Think you can do it?
What did you find out?
It's already been called off. Witnesses confirmed you weren't the shooter.  Did you find out where the bomb is?
What did Cox pull him out early for?
Of the six prison inmates you've tested  all of whom have had at least some military or survival training - only Mr. Barnes is still breathing.
HEY!!!
It was you, wasn't it?
You amped the neural connectors back up, didn't you?  You're the reason the convict died. You're the reason I got fired!
How can I ever thankyou for bringing me back to life a second time, Daryl?
You actually listen to all those tapes?
You're not my therapist. You're hear to study me. Face it  I'm nothing more than a lab rat to you.
Go to hell.
He was reenacting Charles Manson's LaBianca murders.
You've got a problem with me carrying a gun?
What are you doing?
I'm surprised you didn't write one about me.
Remember a few years ago when music schools were using a computerized teaching tool that accidently started frying kids' brains?
Lindenmeyer put increasingly complex combinations of criminal psychological profiles together to develop the ultimate villain.
Remember the bowling ball bag Sid carried with him in virtual reality?
What we need to do is stop playing with computers and go catch the sonof-a-bitch before he kills anybody else.
Told you I wasn't going to go anywhere.
What does that mean?
Sounds to me like a welleducated way of saying you have no idea what to do next.
What the hell's going on?!
It's not just Sid 6.7's performances that are increasing. Stars need bigger and bigger audiences.  Whatever Sid is going to do next, it's going to involve media.
Grimes is back! He's back! He's come back!!!
He didn't know about the neural toxin.  I did.
Where the hell are you going?
Then shoot him already.
You...mother...fucker! I'M GOING TO KILL YOU!!!
I wouldn't pull the trigger if I were you
Waal, Mr. Moss, I wouldn't....
No, this is great.
Ames here.  <u>Yessir</u>...
What can it hurt.
He, uh, has he been in the "jail" long?
And?  NO.  I don't wanna know.  What do you <u>mean</u> "and..."?
<u>IT DESTROYED THE ELECTORAL PROCESS</u>.
...his Triumphal Plane.  Shot Down.
Three minutes.  It couldn't have been over three minutes, the Secret Service...
We are virtually certain it isn't...
When do we bring'em back?
It won't hold, Ronnie, it won't prove out.
Gemme a plane.  Business Aviation, National, one hour. Fly to Chicago.  O'hare, LAX 6 A.M.
Tell, tell, tell me again.
...but...
The hostages, but that was a naturally-occuring...  It was a put-up job?  But where was the, where was the money in that?
We'll be back tonight.
New York Times, Wash Post, Detroit Register, San Diego BEE, all in emission.  <u>No</u> mention of the Girlscout. None.
Gimme the weather for tomorrow morning, five A.M. Andrews...
...uh huh...
Maybe he's just a <u>patriot</u>.
You're tired, Ronnie.
And I'd like to point out that I've been on prescription <u>medication</u>, the side-effects of which...
Oh, Lord....
How's your wife?
That's not bad at all.
... and he spent the last twelve years in a Milit&ry Prison...
Oh, MiGod.
THE PRESIDENT, HOLDING THE PHOTOGRAPH

We're locked into Albania.
Hello...?
Captain...  You wanna Take'er up...?
Nobody whose name you want me to say, Mr. Young, I promise you.
What <u>are</u> you interested in?
What's more interesting than boffing the girlscout?
China.
I'm a Jew in Show Business.  Why come to me?
Here's the Short Course:  Fifty-Four, Forty or Fight. What does <u>that</u> mean?
Remember the Maine...
Who?
"They Got To Know?"  <u>Stan</u>...?  Get with it.  Who Killed Kennedy...?  I read the first draft of the Warren Report, said he was killed by a Drunk <u>Driver</u>.  You watched the Gulf War.  What did you see?  Day after day, the one "Smart Bomb" falling into a building. The <u>truth</u>, I was in the building when they <u>shot</u> that shot, they shot it in a studio, Falls Church Virginia, 1/10th scale model of a building.
You know, you're a <u>writer</u>, that's your script.  You're a <u>director</u>...  But if you're the <u>producer</u> ... what did you do?  What did you do?  All you've got is the <u>credit</u>...  Some plaque on the wall...
Hey, I know that, hey, I'm <u>kidding</u>...  "It's a pageant"
They got to have something that we want.
Well, you could <u>have</u> one, but it'd be a very ineffective war...  We're <u>done</u> in 10 days...
Three-o-three...
At the Airport?  Cause we decided at the Airport he hugs the fat, wet Albanian Broad, we...
The War ain't over.
I think it's fine?
In the Folk Music Section.
What's the thing with Morse Code...
What?

The Albanian Campaign.
I think we asked for "special programs" and they gave us "special prisons."

He's going to be fine, aren't you boy...?
Uh huh...why?
Some'b'y'll have you killed.
You would be, two, if you'd gone through what he went through.
You see?  What's the lesson here?  <u>Never</u> give up. <u>Never</u> give up.

a "pond," or
Fox says Bluestar just hit 23. What do you want him to do?
If I'm closing out this account. If he doesn't pay for it tomorrow, you pay for it.
Fox, you're making more problems than you are sales.
Thank you, Janet...thank you, Mr. Lynch.
Looks bearish to me, buddy. You got it all upside down.  Okay, I'm giving this to you and you alone, 'cause I feel sorry for you. Take the Knicks against the Bullets, and my pick of the day -- Duke to beat the spread against Wake Forest.
Buddy, buddy, when ya gonna realize it's big game hunters that bag the elephants, not retail brokers. I heard this story about Gekko... he was on the phone 30 seconds after the Challenger blew up selling NASA stocks short.
Nice guy but a loser. Lost all his equity when his firm went belly up in the recession of 71. you wanna be coming in here in your late sixties still pitching? ... Whatever happened to that cute analyst at Thudder, Wicks? ... Cindy? Susan?
Hey you hear the news. I just got a job at a new firm: "Dewey, Cheat 'em and Howe." Yuk yuk.
You know what you need, buddy buddy--an optorectomy. That's when they cut the nerve that runs from your brain to your rectum--to change that shitty attitude of yours.
I agree. Go thou and sin no more.
... it adds up Buddy, 300 here, 200 there. Your brother never...  ...well, I always said money is something you need in case you don't die tomorrow...
Yeah, you do that huckleberry. I'll still be here.
He's got your prick in his back pocket, son, and you're standing naked in the display window of Macy's. He's using you. Only you're too blind to see it.
...as far as being axed, I'm still here and as long as I am, I have a responsibility not just to me but to the union members I represent...
Your words, not mine...
...And you're even lovelier than I pictured. I brought a birthday present for Mr. Gekko.
Hello Bud, I'm Lisa, a friend of Gordon's.
Fox, Bud D. is this deja vu or has it really been a year. You're not hitting me up for NYU are you?
Within 45 seconds, a microprocessor computes your systolic and diastolic pressure. Has an LCD readout, and it's cost effective -- less than one visit to the doctor.
So what firm you with, pal?
...going places, good junk bond department, you got the financing on that Syndicam deal.
...A cosmetics company by any chance? What are you, the 12th man on the deal team? The last to know?
My home number's on the back...
Nice club, Mr. Gekko...
Sir Larry Wildman. Like all Brits he thinks he was born with a better pot to piss in... bribed an old secretary of mine to open bar mouth and stole RDL Pharmaceuticals right out from under me. Wildman the white knight.
You don't understand. I want to be surprised...astonish me, sport, new info, don't care where or how you get it, just get it... My wife tells me you put a move on Darien. Here's some inside info for you. That Euroflash GQ guy she's going with's got big bucks but he's putting her feet to sleep. Exit visas are imminent. So don't lose your place in line.  Oh, jeez, I wish you could see this. The lights coming up over the water. I've never seen a painting that captures the beauty of the ocean at this moment.  ...an old Russian proverb - "a fisherman always sees another fisherman from afar." I like you sport, I ever tell you that... Gordon, call me Gordon from now on.
Got him at an auction in Kentucky.
Gordon what I want--and I never asked you for anything--is to be your co-pilot on this. I want to take this airline, turn it around, and make it work. It's gonna make us a fortune!
I didn't know we had a meeting schedule for this morning.
It's all about bucks, kid, the rest is conversation...  Bud, you're still going to be president. And when the time comes, you'll parachute out a rich man. With the money you're going to make, your father won't have to work another day in his life.
The richest one percent of this country owns half the country's wealth: 5 trillion dollars. One third of that comes from hard work, two thirds of it comes from inheritance, interest on interest accumulation to widows and idiot sons and what I do -- stock and real estate speculation. It's bullshit. Ninety percent of the American people have little or no net worth. I create nothing; I own. We make the rules, Buddy, the news, war, peace, famine, upheaval; the cost of a paper clip.  We pull the rabbit out of the hat while everybody else sits around their whole life wondering how we did it...  ...you're not naive enough to think we're living in a democracy are you, Buddy? It's the free market. You're one of us now...take advantage of it. You got the killer instinct, kid, stick with me. I got things to teach you...
Hello Bud.
Not really. I'd say that Gordon is one of the most astute collectors around. He has a great eye and he only buys the best. Like this rug for instance, a silk Tabriz, the finest of its kind. The day after he bought it in London, a dealer representing the Saudi Royal Family offered him twice what he paid. It absolutely makes the room. See how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa... although...  I don't know if I would have used that tea dipped linen for the upholstery - too dingy. And it's a sacrilege having that Pre-Columbian pot in the center of the coffee table. Some dope might use it as an ashtray.
What if I have a previous engagement?
So, how did your conference go with Gordon?
I don't.
You know, the elevator man couldn't believe I paid $300,000 to have my walls looking like this, he's got them for free in Brooklyn.
Let's get things straight, Bud. I'm not going to take a cut. I worked hard and you can't decorate a room in New York for less than $100,000. Curtains alone...
Do you think you're ready?
...that changes all my plans, I thought you were loaded...
Bud! Where you been the last two days?
He had a heart attack, hon, but he's okay, he's at the hospital...
You're right, Mr. Mannheim, but you gotta get to the big time first, then you can be a pillar and do good things.
I thought this was an informal meeting. What's he doing here?
Sorry to hear that. I thought the kid had staying power.
I want to ask you a big favor, Gordon. Please drop the Bluestar deal.
Because I don't want to see him hurt.
I can't...and I won't.
He respond to the offer? What? What the hell's Cromwell doing giving lecture tours when his company's losing 60 million a quarter? I guess he's giving lectures on how to lose money...if this guy opened a funeral parlor, no one would die, this turkey's totally brain dead...Well Christmas is over and business is business.  Keep buying. Dilute the sonofabitch. Ollie I want every orifice in his body flowing red.
Considering you brought my mother into it, $71.50.
Yeah
But?
Well that's for me to know - but I did enjoy rubbing oil all over that big.
Anybody want another drink?
Ok, so maybe I was a little over emotional.
Oh that explains everything.
I can't believe she went out with that monster last night
If you sold your soul to the devil, you'd never age either
Any student of Black Magic can do it.   .most of these books will tell you how! SARAH So what happens when you've sold out?
Can this be stopped?
Darling?  I hear you were having drinks with the butler the other night.  Now  you know that sort of thing leads to anarchy.
When - you're a big boy.  I mean you know it's bad for you
I miss you.
What?
Yes.  I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me full of prozac so he can live out his life in peace.
Why is he worried?
These are good.
She finished my solitaire game and turned on the radio...she likes rock and roll. Angry rock and roll.
How?
What's happening to me?
What?
Norman was telling me the dream house is finally finished.
Uh-huh.  What can be?
For the Dupont Chair.  I swear.  I'm becoming the nosy old lady I used to run from at Amherst.
There was just...some tension.  You were upset.  I remember being concerned.
Well, I'm glad.  Pardon my intrusiveness, but we do have to stick together you know.
You're the flower lady.
I've seen you.  From the window.
Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe?  That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave?
Full scholarships.  Princeton too.  She wanted to stay close.
How you holding up?
Well good.  So you're human.
Just bought this beautiful antique Ouija.
Someone's there.
Then what was it?
Adamant?
I can't believe this is happening.
Jody he was lying.
Claire, I have to show up for the--
Excellent.  Couple of Swedish sailor cells just gang divided a virginal cheerleader cell.
How are you?
Remember how we were?
Why?
Nothing.  There was...I thought I saw something.
Oh.
What are you doing here?
It was there.  This angry music all by itself.  And I heard whispering.
Yep.
Ohmigod.  You'll never believe...I saw Schumway...
And he says...you'll fucking love this, he says, "Doctor Spencer, I am a great admirer of your work..."
"...for my father."
Didn't know he was dead, every stinking paper on the globe.
Sorry.  You understand.
Our house.
Where is she then?
I didn't do that.
She was lonely, I talked to her.  Norman, I know how it looks, but--
When you do this, I swear...
You're not at the center.
I don't need a shrink.
Claire, she's been a huge part of your life for seventeen years.  If you weren't thrown off balance by this, then something would be wrong.
I never said...
What are you...?  No.
You dropped a glass.
Sweetheart, it was over a year ago.
No.  I'm afraid to ask what this is about.
I thought it was Mrs. Feur, but it's not...
It's Madison Fra--
Ow!
"You know..."
She was damaged and unstable.  The more I tried to distance myself, the more desperate she became.  Finally, she showed up at the new house...
The leaves...
I'm cooking you dinner.
I don't believe you.
Mmmuh...
What?
Thank you for this honor, my dear.
Lasher will act, Rowan.  Whatever it is he wants - he's waited three hundred years to have it.   facing him alone...  I don't like -
How do you know about Rowan ...?  I didn't --- Cemetery...?
I hope Ryan explained that if you stay in this town, you're shackled with pushy relations for the rest of your life.
Always give the crovd a taste, darling.  Now - Ryan said I'm supposed to make sure -
Who is this...?
What's the matter with you...?! What kind of person are you...?!
When is the funeral...?   I am coming to my mother's funeral!!
She was alive all these years... You NEVER let me know her. Who gave you that right...?!
I might as well be Rowan Smith - or Jones!   you cut me off from every -
I don't want the -
What is it...?
You kept her in this filth in restraints...?.
He's shown himself to you... on the deck.  In the storm.
Just like your mother - and all the others that felt him - and used his power - and went to hell with a smile!
Did you like it...? Looking down at Graham and knowing what you could do...?
I am with you, my love. Like no other can ever be.
But I could understand. I want to understand!
Do not tell me that!
Only you...
Go on. Rowan.  Go on.
I do not understand...
The portraits, Lasher.  Why are the witches always before a door...? Tell me, Lasher.  Now!
I am your son.  I would not wound you. I could not - ever.
Harder...
I don't remember you at all-  You - you saved my life-  Bizarre thing to say, isn't it...?
Oh. The Green underwater Ghost's...  The Man With The Eyes In His Hands...
He's very pleased with your response to the surroundings.
Doctor's orders- - -?
Far from it, Michael... Don't put me up there.
Christ, Michael - what the hell are we doing...?  We don't even know -
I'm serious.  You don't -
Stop it.
Seems more like a year than a month.
I called Dr. Styles at the Neurological Institute  In L.A., remember...?  He said he'd see you.  He was intrigned.
Go to LAX and get on a flight to New Orleans.  Go to the Ponchartrain Hotel and wait for me.  I'll call you there.
Stop looking at me like that! I'm not some siren chanting to the moon.  And my life is not a cosmic whim!  I am in charge of my life -  - and I want to stay.  Everything that was taken from me is here, Michael. All these years, she was there without me.  Helpless. I should have been here.
Everyone - this is Michael curry.
Either do I.    I love you, Ro.  You know that. You're a total mystery to me - but I love YOU.
Smoking is bad for your heart, Michael.
Gee - look at that.  I didn't know alligators came this far up on shore
No - I didn't kill him.   Would you rather I'd let them kill us - after they'd raped me...?
ROWAN we're below sea level. I've spent time there myself.
You did that, didn't you...?
Michael - what made you fall in love with me...?
Is he - is he gonna die...?
When aid you get home last night...?
Dovetails.  Gotta be a hundred years old.
Something's wrong with you.
I - I...  I can't, Michael.  There's stuff --- at the clinic -
Go home, Stu  I'll call you.
Wow...
You okay...?
A few hours and I'll be wasting away in Margaritaville.  Oh, sweet decadance.
I thought someone was following me - I - er -  I just needed my computer and some things...Listen, I'd like to work from home for a few weeks - is that OK?
When could I look round?
Hello MRS STECKLER - we haven't seen you for a long time
It doesn't mention 'females only'
What didn't you like about her?
My mother...?  I never knew my real MOTHER - I was adopted
What was your relationship with STEPHANIE?
I want it to stop - it all to stop...
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
Don't you want me now LESLIE
Well, what do you think?
Yes - but you live here too - If it were your house?
What's wrong with you?
I want you out now
What brings the rats out of the sewers?
It did give me a chance to meet you again ELLEN - It's all routine you understand...So where were you?
I'm really very sorry - I was banking on this coming through, because it's only five minutes from my surgery...
I thought it was you - how are you?
Oh no sir - just making some enquiries...Just tell her that INSPECTOR TAYLOR called on you - she'll understand
I shouldn't really - I'm not your surgeon...
See? Did you see that?
Someday, I'll find out.
I defy your hamburger theory of life, and all of the unfulfilled hopes and dreams it represents.
What are the odds of there being ANOTHER Ted Nelson on our flight?
...A bouncer? Are you serious?
Hurry.
I get it now. You and me. We're dead.
Our plane crashed. In the Grand Canyon. A big fiery explosion. We never made it to L.A. They needed dental records to identify us. And this place. This. Actually. Is. Heaven.
I feel like I've just been hit by a Mack truck.
I thought I loved her.
If it isn't straight by now, son, you probably should see a doctor.
You really don't get it, do you? I am genetically programmed to desire a big, buff, manly man who can defend and provide for me and my yet to be conceived offspring! It's, like, a caveman thing!
I remember the first time you walked into Mrs. Temple's class in 2nd grade. Blue gingham dress. Blond ponytail.
Remember dress up day?  You and Charlie lifting skirts during recess.
We can't accept it.  It's much too expensive. Right, dear?
Ted, we put a lot of love in our business.
I remember spring break of my senior year.  Seems like a lifetime ago.
Son.
There ya go. Always remember, focus on the peach...
Finally, some gratitude.
I paid off the mortgage! I ordered that Winnebago you always wanted! Now you're ashamed of me?
THAT is your dream, not mine. My dream is so far beyond anything YOU PEOPLE could even imagine.
I-I don't have the keys.
I'm Ted, by the way. I think I forgot to say that.
This is humiliating. We're being ejected from a prom!
Can you believe that was me?
I wondered about them, for so many years. I wondered if I looked like them, acted like them. I wondered why they gave me up.
They say money can't buy happiness but this is a reasonably good facsimile.
I came to ask permission to take custody of your room.
I miss them, too.
He was my Grandfather, too.
Let me guess: retail sales of little chocolate sprinkles have gone through the roof!
Ah ha! It was so well hidden, you didn't even know it was there.
Just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesn't mean you're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago.
She said peanuts, you cretin.
Charlie's right. Jealousy is so unattractive.
Why can't you be nice to me?
Wow...you clean up nice.
Now it makes sense, the whole neo Bohemian, down with hypocrisy, fight the power crap. You're a poor little rich girl.
I mean my father.
That's two words. And I'm out of the "exposed" business, remember? I need to graduate. Besides, Merk's a boy scout.
That's probably my office.
I see.
You're telling me you don't get aroused by a roomful of naked breasts.
Which explains the continued success of "Heaven" for how many decades?
The thing is, I'll need a first mate.
I know where you can find an excellent editor-in-chief.
Yeah, I'm doing fine.  I have so much to tell you.  I don't even know where to begin.
Well? Surprised?
You don't have to work another day in your lives.
I'll be blunt. I know you can take it.
Ted, you are the best editor this school paper ever had. You don't need to be pandering flesh. It's nonsense. It's beneath you.
Come on, it's our only senior prom.
You do like girls, don't you?
The parties are held in here when the weather dips below seventy. Which is seldom.
I do?
You were the new and improved you.
No one will be laughing at you now, Ted. You can take that to the bank.
I've been very lazy for a long, long time.
Don't forget to tell them all your qualifications.
I owe it all to you. Without your help I'd be lost.
Thanks for teaching me an important lesson. What makes a family is love, not blood.
Not that I'm going to be much good after last night...
You look pretty.
I was thinking, Antigua, maybe.
Gator can't see what's in front of it for shit.  They see out the sides.  That one don't even know Walter's arm's in his mouth.
Got sort of hung up on her, from what hear.
So Suzie and Sandra Van Ryan were half- sisters.
You okay?
You mean he withdrew...
Same as him.  They saw her come.  They saw her go.  They saw him follow.
You can go up to one of those trees and peel the bark.  You know what you get? More bark.  And more bark.  There's no core.  Tree's not good tar anything but sucking up water.  And now they can't get rid of them.  They've tried poisons. Nothing works.  They don't die.
Guess I kind of lost it there.
If you want company...
Two kids could've gotten into a fight, lost a couple of teeth.
Where's the body?
You didn't tell me you were gonna put me on the fucking news.
He did say something.
Or maybe she thought that was what she wanted and she got a little more than she bargained for...
We've got three.  Guy mowing his yard, couple of kids playing hoops.
She bit you?
The teeth, were they...
You guess?  Did he or didn't he?
And then what... he touched you?  Did you maybe flirt a little...
Suzie!  Did this man rape you?
Ms. Toller?
He was my friend at first.  Then I got busted... he didn't even stick up for me.  I had to go away to that hellhole. It's like, you're his favorite, then who cares?  You wanna know something?  When Kelly said we should do this, I thought cool, all these big shots screwing me over, like that cop, Duquette.  Now they're gonna get screwed.
Come on.  Beats study hall, doesn't it?
I say something funny?
What are you looking at?
What?
So, where you off to now?
All right.  I'll have to look for it.
We have to stick with the plan.
Kelly.  Is Suzie there?
No!  Christ.  Listen, Kelly, I'm counting on you.  You calm her down. I mean do whatever you have to, whatever it takes...
I'm really serious.  That cop, he keeps watching me.
I just want my life back...
Come on, let loose!
You'll get over it. We've got a knockdown, airtight, motherfucker of a lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan.
You're saying that Kelly was raped by Sam Lombardo.
I'm placing your daughter under arrest.
It's Celine.  He's okay.  He had a pretty good line on what cheap fucks people are.
Yeah, they're bad for your health.  I'm tryin' to look out for you...
Well, you're half right.  Best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me.
Get away from me.
Sam, for godsake.
But you do admit to touching her, to putting your arm around her.  Isn't that against the rules?
Hey, what did you want me to do, die?
Did you become squeamish about these things before or after you bludgeoned little Suzie Toller to death with a wine bottle?  Jesus, man. It couldn't have worked out better. They're convinced Kelly whacked Suzie. I can't talk 'em out of it.  We should be celebrating.  This thing worked out just like you said, only better.
I thought this was supposed to be a vacation.  Why didn't you buy a nice big power boat?
Sam...
Yeah, right.
Sandy... What's up?
Didn't you see her this morning?
That should put us ahead of the criminals.
Yes, aha.  A brass screw.
Come Llewellyn, don't tarry.
All that jumping and kicking.
Thank you.
No record of him.
What's this?
Got to be somewhere that's hot. He said it was "damnably hot."
We've got to stop him right here, now!  With that armored steam engine of his it'll be a slaughter.
God in heaven, what is that?!
A new friend?
My name's Tyler.  Frank Tyler. Pleased to meet you, ma'am.
You know, ma'am, you remind me of a pearl-handled pistol I once owned. A beautiful thing to look at, but too hot to handle.
Please do.  I'm a man who appreciates a good firearm.
Doyle's the name, sir.  Of the Connemara Doyles.  And there's not a man riding the rails who holds a candle to meself.  That having been said, sir, you're five minutes late so let's be on our way!  Your friend's already aboard.
Good work.  Really.
But what would anyone have to gain from all this...?  Unless it were a foreign power.
... well, of course you can.  Mr. President, what a surprise.  What brings you here?
I admire a man with a sense of humor.
Really?  Must be a dangerous business.
I only met him once, but that was enough.  For such a little man he had quite an oversized opinion of himself.  He offered me the "rare and unparalleled opportunity" to develop a new steam engine for him.  He claims to have some sort of factory in Texas, I believe. Said I could have the run of the place.  He had all sorts of specifications.  But when I questioned him closely, it became obvious he was just another mercenary businessman.  Both he and his partner had no real love of steam.  It's sad.  So few men do.
This is something.
Hey...!
We're going into battle, little one.  Find a woman to take care of it.
Madmartigan!  What did you do this time?
Airk!  Come on, Airk.  Lemme outa here.
It's you they're after, Madmarti- gan.  What did you do this time?
You gonna be a hero, Madmartigan? I've lost half my men fighting Kael, and Bavmorda, and the Nock- maar army.  Now you and this Peck, and that magpie up in the rafters, are gonna take 'em on alone?
Willow Ufgood.
You are the guardian, Willow.  You must take her to Tir Asleen.
You are very important, Willow.
They look like acorns.
You're strong enough.  But you're going to need courage, Willow.
Go in the direction the bird is flying.
Gawd...you're...beautiful...
You're a fool.  Now put her back.
Then you get us out of here.
We're a tiny version of all that?
Smells like a battle.
What's that?  I hear something!
You gotta promise to feed her.
Time to change her diaper.
Because she's sick.
Where's the baby??
When I left the crossroads, I got ambushed by an elf!
I was in love once, Willow.  She had a hold on my heart.  I could barely function.  I *was* a great swordsman!  I was knighted!  I could have been king!
I'm beginning to think you two *deserve* to be locked up.
Watch it!
It's not a Nelwyn baby.
Can't we keep it, Dada?
How??
Get down!  The ritual chant! Quick!  Protect yourself!
Time is running out.
Are you sure?
We gotta follow them.
She requests the presence of your- self and the young princess.
You don't know anything... borrowed your car. Didn't say why. And you never heard of that woman and her boy.
Good morning. Book, is it? You are the Yankee they talk about?
Your hole is healed, then?
I saw him.
That's Luke. He doesn't like strangers.
What are you going to do?
So one of them got to him.
When word gets out that Zenovitch was a cop, all hell will break lose. You've got 24 hours. That's all I can give you. 24 hours on your own. After that the case and the witness go back to the Homicide Department.
Where are you taking us?
They kid a lot.
But why?
How long have I been here?
Your husband's?
Where's the nearest telephone?
Well... the store at Saltzburg...  But you won't be going to Saltzburg for a while.
But Stoltzfus said...
What else can you do?
There was a time when I thought you might have stayed.
There was a time when I would have welcomed it.
You're so sure of that?
There is always a way! But you are such a... a Glotzkopp you cannot see! You'd rather go back to that city! To nothing! No woman! No children! No land!
Nothing. I'm not going to be around for a while. I'll call you when I can.
It's me.
Where I'm at is maybe 1890.
Did you find him?
Of course, Elaine. But as long as there's any question, better Johnny should come back and clear his name.
What's so funny?
God, Fred...
Is this where we're going?
Seventy --  Dorothy, please!
Oh, Auntie Em -- it's you!
But I did leave you, Uncle Henry -- that's just the trouble.  And I tried to get back for days and days.
Oh, we dream lots of silly things when we --
Then this is a day of Independence For all the Munchkins and their descendants!
From now on you'll be history
...have you come back?
If you were really great and powerful, you'd keep your promises!
Oh!  Oh, Zeke!  Help!  Help me, Zeke!  Get me out of here!  Help!
Run, Toto, run!
Are you a good witch, or a bad witch?
Oh, very good, but very mysterious.  He lives in the Emerald City, and that's a long journey from here. Did you bring your broomstick with you?
Well, then, you'll have to walk.  The Munchkins will see you safely to the border of Munchkinland.  And remember, never let those ruby slippers off your feet for a moment, or you will be at the mercy of the Wicked Witch of the West.
Are you ready now?
That's our farm!
That's all -- the Crystal's gone dark.
Here!  I've got an order!  Let me have...
...m...m...my, my, my, my goodness -- I can talk again! Oh -- oil my arms, please -- oil my elbows.
Oh - I'll get it!
Can't that female take no for an answer?
Oh, my!
Ho -- ho --ho -- ho
Who's her?  Who's her?
Oh, but -- but please. It's very important.
Oh -- Oh, come on.
Oh, now I'll never get home!
Wonderful!  Why, if our Scarecrow back in Kansas could do that, the crows'd be scared to pieces!
Um-hmm.
I don't blame you for that.
Oh, I'll try!  Really, I will.
Why, it's a man!  A man made out of tin!
...just that the Witch is so wicked. I don't think you two ought to come with me because you'll get into trouble.
I don't like this forest!  It's -- it's dark and creepy!
The ruby slippers!  What have you done with them? Give them back to me, or I'll ---
You stay out of this, Glinda, or I'll fix you as well!
Yeah.
Here --   Come on.
You don't get around us that easy!
What's she done?  I'm all but lame from the bite on my leg!
No, her dog!
...of the West.
Ha -- ha -- ha --
Oh, did - did you see that?
Oh, I think I see a jijik And he's fuzzy and he's furry I haven't got a brain But I think I ought to worry!
Uh - now, please don't be angry with me. I'll - I'll do anything you say, only... only if you don't shout at me. It makes me nervous!
-- And the courage that you promised Cowardly Lion?
How can I ever thank you enough?
You new?
What the hell are you talking about?
The King pipeline.
Zukovsky...
Is there another way?
The bullet is moving through the medulla oblongata, killing off his sense of touch. He feels no pain. He can push himself harder, longer than any normal man.
Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.
The report King bought. Its a manual. Renards men used it to remove this radio tracking device from the warhead.
Theyre getting their weapons from the Russians, but where are they getting the money to buy the weapons?  I cant help thinking...the person close to King, the one who switched that pin...
Your last chance. Take the money.
You will never touch her. You will never get near her.
I met you at my fathers funeral.
I think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone. Especially Kings daughter.
You dont take no for an answer, do you?
Then take me with you.
Vodka martini.
I understand its normally good practice to get the feel of the cards before going off the deep end.
How did you survive?
Im coming with you.
Since I was a child, Ive always had a power over men. When I realized my father wouldnt rescue me from the kidnappers, I knew I had to form a new alliance.
Bond. If someone wants you dead, it is Renard. Our government has nothing to gain by killing you.
That is 5,000 dollars of Beluga ruined!
What is this place?
Why are you like this?  Because Bond is dead?  Its what you wanted.
What kind of time frame are we talking about?
Had a lot of blood in him.
No idea who's behind this?
There's no right or wrong.  But if you don't give me an honest response, I can't help you.  I want to help you.  I want to know all about you.
Would you like me to stay?
I'm not here.  I'm still on Mars.  I've come to collect you.
Jon, does anybody know what the hell you're talking about?  Dan's just an ordinary guy, but he talks to me.  When he looks at me he's seeing something more than just a -- a collection of atoms.
But you knew that I'd -- die.
Oh God.  I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.
You have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.
It's -- he's got some kind of conspiracy theory.  He thinks someone's . . . I don't know, stalking us.
No.  I just wanted you to --
She's with me.
It's a tachyon chamber.  It generates subatomic particles which flow backward in time.  There are other worlds, Daniel, other timelines -- existing parallel to our own --
Sorry, it's this thing with Blake.  I mean, you don't really think anyone's out to get us -- do you?
His what?
No wonder Adrian's rich.  You use that stuff?
Old?
Laurie --
The Owlship.  I can't believe it.
Dan!  The spare costumes!  I can't believe you kept them.
What the hell -- ?
. . . That was quick.
CTU.  Could be behind Dr. Manhattan frame-up.
We're running, Rorschach.  We've got no place to go.  We're hightailing it down to Adrian's.
Cases, leads -- they don't matter, Rorschach.  The world's about to end.  If someone is trying to kill us, it doesn't matter.
Sorry, Daniel.  You've always been a good friend.  I know that.  Sorry about Laurie.
Adrian.  What are you doing?  Why wouldn't you let us in?
No.  No.  Cut.  -- Justine, we agreed.  No questions about the Watchmen.
You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let's move it.
Nasty cough.  -- Try one of mine.  Darling, you need to get out of the house.  Why don't you give Daniel a call?  I'm sure he'd be glad to hear from you.
I don't know who you are buddy, but I swear to God, you got the wrong guy.
Rorschach, you're talkin' heavy duty stuff.  I got nothing to do with --
New information.
Gila Flats -- place where Jon turned into . . .
What is this place?
Now I'm the one who's nauseous. So what's the deal? What do you need me for?
I expect you to call in regularly with progress reports.
I guess you got my E-mail. I set up a purchase. Ten cars.
You did say "Ahab"? You're sure about that?
They retrofitted Ahab with some kind of rocket launcher. They were loading canisters of liquid into it, light colored and dark colored in the same tube but separate. Something tells me this it that "classified" stuff you didn't want me to know about. Does the song "Silent Night" mean anything to you?
Cut the crap, X, I saw you down there. You're a hero. Don't be afraid to join the good guys.
All for show. Just a psychological mind game to get you to do the right thing.
How will you fix it?
The usual prospects. Convicts, contract killers, murde...
Alright, do what you want. But keep the screws on him. He's a wild card. That could be either good or bad.
Do they have any special powers? The bosses always have special powers.
What are you gonna do? They're Euro- trash.
You do everything Yorgi says?
It's gonna be like that, huh? You got all bent out of shape as soon as he started dancing with someone else. Why's that?
Where are you going?
I also remember you drove your car here. Who are you really? Make no mistake, I will shoot you and not feel bad about it. Who are you working for?
I don't know what you're talking about.
There's no more time for games. They made you. There's a sniper out front waiting to put a bullet in your eye. Tell me if it's true.
That's alright, I'll figure something out.
I can't let this happen. I want you to go out the back. I'll make up some excuse.
So what's the plan with this Ahab? Are they selling it or what?
I heard you talking. I could tell where you were in the room.
They left. To a fortress in the mountains.
I must be healthy, then, because I'm scared to death. I guess I'd better get back to Yorgi.
Did you do your homework?
Where'd the damn truck go?!
It's running three meters down. Twenty knots.
By then it's too late! The only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water! The chemicals will break down and dissipate!
Back off, just go away you klutz. Alright, here's the story. The items in these cases belong to me. I designed them, built them, and was going to use them in the field myself until you showed up.
Miniature power cams set in on contact, giving you a sure grip on any surface.
I think I'll hang on to these.
I'm having fun, what's the problem?
Sit down.
Dude, what are you doing here?
Oh come on, don't feel bad. You got played, so what? You're new at this. Did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out?
Heads up, man. What's this thing on my back?
Help me with this guy.
Cops. Like a plague. No matter how many you pay there's always another with his hand out. How did you pick him out?
Thanks, but I'm here on business. I heard you're the G around here. I'm looking for some cars, expensive ones. A lot of them.
We seen all your shit! So you want cars? We get whatever cars you need. What are you looking for?
Very nice. I'm impressed.
That was for Anders.
And you. Why do you have such a problem staying away, my friend? Did you miss us that much?
What's the gimmick, Yorgi? That's the part I don't get. You gonna hold the world hostage with your gas bombs? I didn't think you were dumb enough to go with that hack cliche.
Including rape, pillage, murder.
I wish I could go.
Yes -- Only there's a problem.  The mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature.  It's forcing the body's cells to replicate thousands of times faster than they're accustomed to.  The Senator's body is literally burning itself out.  Scott -- this machine kills people and I don't think Magneto realizes it.
What are you talking about?
Are you all right?
I'll tell you one thing though.
Inspiring -- Now what am I doing here?
The Professor said you were a solider. Actually, I believe he used the word mercenary.
You should always work with a spotter.
I was thinking maybe you and me could go into town.
He takes himself seriously.
Logan, do you see this ring?
You wouldn't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to --
Who?
Where are we going?
How?
You designed this yourself?
I've found her, Westchester Mall.
Don't you knock?
Why?  You have a home here now, if you want it.  Everyone will...
You definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me, Max. What is it like these days?
If I could make you understand.  If you could just be made to see it the way I do.  The way it's going to be.
This checkmate goes to you.  I didn't want to hurt anyone.  But you leave me no choice.
Excuse me, Mr. Waldman -- excuse me for interrupting.  But is Frederick, then...a medical doctor?
And has he achieved...any special degree of eminence?
Herr Falkstein! You have your instructions!
What?
MMMMM!  MMMMM!
Did you see?...I put a special hamper in the bathroom just for your shirts.  the other one is just for socks and poo-poo undies.
I've trimmed the list to only our very closest friends...but it still comes to three thousand.
I will!  Goodbye, darling!
Surprised?
Love me?
Are you suggesting I call him master???
Poor Delbruck!  There must be some way to reach him -- to control that body.
Oh, Delbruck, Delbruck.  Was will dien tachlas von Dir?
I suppose you're right.
I hope you find this comfortable. This was Baron Victor's room.
I see.  And where is my grandfather's private library?
Well... we'll see.
Dr. Frankenstein?
One week at the most!?
That's 'Fronkonsteen.'
In conclusion... it should be noted that more than common injury to the nerve roots is always serious, because... once a nerve fibber is severed... there is no way to regenerate life back into it.  Are there any more questions before we leave?
But, sir...
Are you putting me on?
And do you also say Fro dereck?
I see.
Incidentally -- I don't mean to embarrass you in any way, but I'm a rather brilliant surgeon.  Perhaps I can help you with that hump.
There.
Suit yourself...I'm easy.  Better watch out for the wockers.
Down!  Get down, you beasts!
What are you doing here?
Did you hear that strange music??
You didn't hear... nothing! Aren't there any lights in this place?
Did you see anyone else down here?
How?
Yes!  When I give the word -- throw the first switch!
More, do you hear me?
Throw the third switch!
Yes, master.  Are you sure you want to go through with it?
Hello there.
I'm going to untie you -- can you understand that?
What's that tune that you're playing
Did you ever have a roll in the hay?
Inga!
Ooh!
A god?
Oh, Doctor!
It looks that way.
I know, but I mean -- not fooling around physically?... Or not fooling around intellectually?
There can never... ever... be anything physical between us. You know that, dear.
Yes, I will.
All right if I turn out the lamp, sweetheart?
MMMMmmmmm!
Are you ready for me?
It's working!  Oh, Doctor -- you play beautifully.
Yes, sir, name, please?
Do you have a reservation?
Foooooood!
Will we be fighting the Zulus soo~, Quartermaster? .
Were they in good heart as they entered enemy territory?
Tell what you see. Write it well, Sir, and make sure you get it right
Do not confuse yourse{fi Why? We must strike a heavy blow. This cannot be a war of manoeuvre.
You intended to bring your reserves across the river?
Well I assure you, Sir, I have no desire to create difficulties. 45
